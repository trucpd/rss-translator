If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there’s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It’s also actually how I’d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn’t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the “best practice” solution), but sometimes they can’t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let’s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I’ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

It will delay the start of the main container until the command is successfully executed (returns <code>0</code> exit status). If you’re wondering why I’ve added it to my <code>initContainer</code>, let’s analyse what happens If I’d added it to myapp container.

After a while, the sidecar will begin to restart itself, but it won’t influence the main container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findings-summary\">Findings summary</h2>\n<p>I’ll summarize the startup behavior in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Probe/Hook</th>\n<th>Sidecar starts before the main app?</th>\n<th>Main app waits for the sidecar to be ready?</th>\n<th>What if the check doesn’t pass?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>readinessProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is not ready; main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>livenessProbe</code></td>\n<td>Yes, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is restarted, main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>startupProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>postStart</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, main app container starts after <code>postStart</code> completes</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but you have to provide custom logic for that</td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To summarize: with sidecars often being a dependency of the main application, you may want to delay the start of the latter until the sidecar is healthy.\nThe ideal pattern is to start both containers simultaneously and have the app container logic delay at all levels, but it’s not always possible. If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition. Thankfully, it’s nice and quick, and you have the recipe ready above.</p>\n<p>Happy deploying!</p>",

We are\nalso pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant\nimplementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog\nannouncement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on\nApril 24, 2025.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the <em>Standard</em> channel\n(Gateway API's GA release channel): <em>percentage-based request mirroring</em>, and\nintroduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\nfilters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry\nbudgets.</p>\n<p>Also see the full\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-CHANGELOG.md\">release notes</a>\nand applaud the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-TEAM.md\">v1.3.0 release team</a>\nnext time you see them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduation-to-standard-channel\">Graduation to Standard channel</h2>\n<p>Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API\nfeatures, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of\nconfidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility.\nOf course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue\nto evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network)\ncertainly expect\nfurther refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how\nall of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning Policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"percentage-based-request-mirroring\">Percentage-based request mirroring</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/LiorLieberman\">Lior Lieberman</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/jakebennert\">Jake Bennert</a></p>\n<p>GEP-3171: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-3171/index.md\">Percentage-Based Request Mirroring</a></p>\n<p><em>Percentage-based request mirroring</em> is an enhancement to the\nexisting support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-request-mirroring/\">HTTP request mirroring</a>, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the\nRequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot; being mirrored to &quot;foo-v2&quot;:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000;

For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet.

This is used to limit additional client-side retries\nafter reaching a configured threshold. When configuring the budget, the maximum\npercentage of active requests that may consist of retries may be specified, as well as\nthe interval over which requests will be considered when calculating the threshold\nfor retries. The development of this specification changed the existing\nexperimental API kind BackendLBPolicy into a new experimental API kind,\nXBackendTrafficPolicy, in the interest of reducing the proliferation of policy\nresources that had commonalities.</p>\n<p>To be able to use experimental retry budgets, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xbackendtrafficpolicies.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XBackendTrafficPolicy yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows an XBackendTrafficPolicy that applies a\n<code>retryConstraint</code> that represents a budget that limits the retries to a maximum\nof 20% of requests, over a duration of 10 seconds, and to a minimum of 3 retries\nover 1 second.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>XBackendTrafficPolicy<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>traffic-policy-example<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">retryConstraint</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">budget</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">percent</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">20</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">interval</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>10s<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">minRetryRate</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">count</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">3</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">interval</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>1s<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>...<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of\nKubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API.

This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-place-pod-resize\">What is in-place Pod resize?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts.</p>\n<p>In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a <em>running</em> Pod, often without requiring a container restart.</p>\n<p>Here's the core idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>spec.containers[*].resources</code> field in a Pod specification now represents the <em>desired</em> resources and is mutable for CPU and memory.</li>\n<li>The <code>status.containerStatuses[*].resources</code> field reflects the <em>actual</em> resources currently configured on a running container.</li>\n<li>You can trigger a resize by updating the desired resources in the Pod spec via the new <code>resize</code> subresource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try it out on a v1.33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires <code>kubectl</code> v1.32+):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl edit pod &lt;pod-name&gt; --subresource resize\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation:\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-in-place-pod-resize-matter\">Why does in-place Pod resize matter?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Disruption:</strong> Stateful applications, long-running batch jobs, and sensitive workloads can have their resources adjusted without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a Pod restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Resource Utilization:</strong> Scale down over-provisioned Pods without disruption, freeing up resources in the cluster. Conversely, provide more resources to Pods under heavy load without needing a restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Scaling:</strong> Address transient resource needs more quickly. For example Java applications often need more CPU during startup than during steady-state operation. Start with higher CPU and resize down later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-changed-between-alpha-and-beta\">What's changed between Alpha and Beta?</h2>\n<p>Since the alpha release in v1.27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-user-facing-changes\">Notable user-facing changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>resize</code> Subresource:</strong> Modifying Pod resources must now be done via the Pod's <code>resize</code> subresource (<code>kubectl patch pod &lt;name&gt; --subresource resize ...</code>). <code>kubectl</code> versions v1.32+ support this argument.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize Status via Conditions:</strong> The old <code>status.resize</code> field is deprecated. The status of a resize operation is now exposed via two Pod conditions:\n<ul>\n<li><code>PodResizePending</code>: Indicates the Kubelet cannot grant the resize immediately (e.g., <code>reason: Deferred</code> if temporarily unable, <code>reason: Infeasible</code> if impossible on the node).</li>\n<li><code>PodResizeInProgress</code>: Indicates the resize is accepted and being applied. Errors encountered during this phase are now reported in this condition's message with <code>reason: Error</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sidecar Support:</strong> Resizing <a class=\"glossary-tooltip\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"An auxilliary container that stays running throughout the lifecycle of a Pod.\">sidecar containers</a> in-place is now supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stability-and-reliability-enhancements\">Stability and reliability enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refined Allocated Resources Management:</strong> The allocation management logic with the Kubelet was significantly reworked, making it more consistent and robust. The changes eliminated whole classes of bugs, and greatly improved the reliability of in-place Pod resize.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Checkpointing &amp; State Tracking:</strong> A more robust system for tracking &quot;allocated&quot; and &quot;actuated&quot; resources was implemented, using new checkpoint files (<code>allocated_pods_state</code>, <code>actuated_pods_state</code>) to reliably manage resize state across Kubelet restarts and handle edge cases where runtime-reported resources differ from requested ones. Several bugs related to checkpointing and state restoration were fixed. Checkpointing efficiency was also improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Resize Detection:</strong> Enhancements to the Kubelet's Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) allow the Kubelet to respond to and complete resizes much more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced CRI Integration:</strong> A new <code>UpdatePodSandboxResources</code> CRI call was added to better inform runtimes and plugins (like NRI) about Pod-level resource changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Numerous Bug Fixes:</strong> Addressed issues related to systemd cgroup drivers, handling of containers without limits, CPU minimum share calculations, container restart backoffs, error propagation, test stability, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn't stop here! Here's what the community is focusing on next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stability and Productionization:</strong> Continued focus on hardening the feature, improving performance, and ensuring it is robust for production environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Addressing Limitations:</strong> Working towards relaxing some of the current limitations noted in the documentation, such as allowing memory limit decreases.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-vertically\">VerticalPodAutoscaler</a> (VPA) Integration:</strong> Work to enable VPA to leverage in-place Pod resize is already underway. A new <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> update mode will allow it to attempt non-disruptive resizes first, or fall back to recreation if needed. This will allow users to benefit from VPA's recommendations with significantly less disruption.</li>\n<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Gathering feedback from users adopting the beta feature is crucial for prioritizing further enhancements and addressing any uncovered issues or bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-and-providing-feedback\">Getting started and providing feedback</h2>\n<p>With the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature gate enabled by default in v1.33, you can start experimenting with in-place Pod resizing right away!</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">documentation</a> for detailed guides and examples.</p>\n<p>As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable. Please report any issues or share your experiences via the standard Kubernetes communication channels (GitHub issues, mailing lists, Slack). You can also review the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1287-in-place-update-pod-resources\">KEP-1287: In-place Update of Pod Resources</a> for the full in-depth design details.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing how the community leverages in-place Pod resize to build more efficient and resilient applications on Kubernetes!</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>This announcement originally <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/announcing-etcd-3.6/\">appeared</a> on the etcd blog.</em></p>\n<p>Today, we are releasing <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.6.0\">etcd v3.6.0</a>, the first minor release since etcd v3.5.0 on June 15, 2021. This release\nintroduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing efforts like downgrade support and\nmigration to v3store, and addresses numerous critical &amp; major issues. It also includes major optimizations in\nmemory usage, improving efficiency and performance.</p>\n<p>In addition to the features of v3.6.0, etcd has joined Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve\nproject sustainability. We've introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability.\nThrough the etcd-operator Working Group, we plan to improve usability as well.</p>\n<p>What follows are the most significant changes introduced in etcd v3.6.0, along with the discussion of the\nroadmap for future development. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>etcd takes security seriously. To enhance software security in v3.6.0, we have improved our workflow checks by\nintegrating <code>govulncheck</code> to scan the source code and <code>trivy</code> to scan container images. These improvements\nhave also been backported to supported stable releases.</p>\n<p>etcd continues to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/security/security-release-process.md\">Security Release Process</a> to ensure vulnerabilities are properly managed and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<h3 id=\"migration-to-v3store\">Migration to v3store</h3>\n<p>The v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4 but could still be enabled via <code>--enable-v2</code>. It remained the source of\ntruth for membership data. In etcd v3.6.0, v2store can no longer be enabled as the <code>--enable-v2</code> flag has been removed,\nand v3store has become the sole source of truth for membership data.</p>\n<p>While v2store still exists in v3.6.0, etcd will fail to start if it contains any data other than membership information.\nTo assist with migration, etcd v3.5.18+ provides the <code>etcdutl check v2store</code> command, which verifies that v2store\ncontains only membership data (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19113\">PR 19113</a>).</p>\n<p>Compared to v2store, v3store offers better performance and transactional support. It is also the actively maintained\nstorage engine moving forward.</p>\n<p>The removal of v2store is still ongoing and is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade\">Downgrade</h3>\n<p>etcd v3.6.0 is the first version to fully support downgrade. The effort for this downgrade task spans\nboth versions 3.5 and 3.6, and all related work is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11716\">issues/11716</a>.</p>\n<p>At a high level, the process involves migrating the data schema to the target version (e.g., v3.5),\nfollowed by a rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>Ensure the cluster is healthy, and take a snapshot backup. Validate whether the downgrade is valid:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade validate 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade validate success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the downgrade is valid, enable downgrade mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>etcd will then migrate the data schema in the background. Once complete, proceed with the rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>For details, refer to the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/downgrades/downgrade_3_6/\">Downgrade-3.6</a> guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-gates\">Feature gates</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, we introduced Kubernetes-style feature gates for managing new features. Previously, we\nindicated unstable features through the <code>--experimental</code> prefix in feature flag names. The prefix was removed\nonce the feature was stable, causing a breaking change. Now, features will start in Alpha, progress\nto Beta, then GA, or get deprecated. This ensures a much smoother upgrade and downgrade experience for users.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/feature-gates/\">feature-gates</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livezreadyz-checks\">livez / readyz checks</h3>\n<p>etcd now supports <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code> endpoints, aligning with Kubernetes' Liveness and Readiness probes.\n<code>/livez</code> indicates whether the etcd instance is alive, while <code>/readyz</code> indicates when it is ready to serve requests.\nThis feature has also been backported to release-3.5 (starting from v3.5.11) and release-3.4 (starting from v3.4.29).\nSee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/monitoring/\">livez/readyz</a> for details.</p>\n<p>The existing <code>/health</code> endpoint remains functional. <code>/livez</code> is similar to <code>/health?serializable=true</code>, while\n<code>/readyz</code> is similar to <code>/health</code> or <code>/health?serializable=false</code>. Clearly, the <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code>\nendpoints provide clearer semantics and are easier to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v3discovery\">v3discovery</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, the new discovery protocol <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v3discovery</a> was introduced, based on clientv3.\nIt facilitates the discovery of all cluster members during the bootstrap phase.</p>\n<p>The previous <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v2discovery</a> protocol, based on clientv2, has been deprecated. Additionally,\nthe public discovery service at <a href=\"https://discovery.etcd.io/\">https://discovery.etcd.io/</a>, which relied on v2discovery, is no longer maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"memory\">Memory</h3>\n<p>In this release, we reduced average memory consumption by at least 50% (see Figure 1). This improvement is primarily due to two changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value of <code>--snapshot-count</code> has been reduced from 100,000 in v3.5 to 10,000 in v3.6. As a result, etcd v3.6 now retains only about 10% of the history records compared to v3.5.</li>\n<li>Raft history is compacted more frequently, as introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/18825\">PR/18825</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Diagram of memory usage\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-1.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Memory usage comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under different read/write ratios.\nEach subplot shows the memory usage over time with a specific read/write ratio. The red line represents etcd\nv3.5.20, while the teal line represents v3.6.0-rc.2. Across all tested ratios, v3.6.0-rc.2 exhibits lower and\nmore stable memory usage.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"throughput\">Throughput</h3>\n<p>Compared to v3.5, etcd v3.6 delivers an average performance improvement of approximately 10%\nin both read and write throughput (see Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5). This improvement is not attributed to\nany single major change, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple minor enhancements. One such\nexample is the optimization of the free page queries introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt/pull/419\">PR/419</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"etcd read transaction performance with a high write ratio\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio.

For a complete list, please refer to\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>Old binaries are incompatible with new schema versions</p>\n<p>Old etcd binaries are not compatible with newer data schema versions. For example, etcd 3.5 cannot start with\ndata created by etcd 3.6, and etcd 3.4 cannot start with data created by either 3.5 or 3.6.</p>\n<p>When downgrading etcd, it's important to follow the documented downgrade procedure. Simply replacing\nthe binary or image will result in the incompatibility issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peer-endpoints-no-longer-serve-client-requests\">Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests</h3>\n<p>Client endpoints (<code>--advertise-client-urls</code>) are intended to serve client requests only, while peer\nendpoints (<code>--initial-advertise-peer-urls</code>) are intended solely for peer communication. However, due to an implementation\noversight, the peer endpoints were also able to handle client requests in etcd 3.4 and 3.5. This behavior was misleading and\nencouraged incorrect usage patterns. In etcd 3.6, this misleading behavior was corrected via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13565\">PR/13565</a>; peer endpoints\nno longer serve client requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-boundary-between-etcdctl-and-etcdutl\">Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl</h3>\n<p>Both <code>etcdctl</code> and <code>etcdutl</code> are command line tools. <code>etcdutl</code> is an offline utility designed to operate directly on\netcd data files, while <code>etcdctl</code> is an online tool that interacts with etcd over a network. Previously, there were some\noverlapping functionalities between the two, but these overlaps were removed in 3.6.0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl defrag --data-dir</code></p>\n<p>The <code>etcdctl defrag</code> command only support online defragmentation and no longer supports offline defragmentation.\nTo perform offline defragmentation, use the <code>etcdutl defrag --data-dir</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot status</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports retrieving the status of a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot status</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports restoring from a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot restore</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"critical-bug-fixes\">Critical bug fixes</h2>\n<p>Correctness has always been a top priority for the etcd project. In the process of developing 3.6.0, we found and\nfixed a few notable bugs that could lead to data inconsistency in specific cases. These fixes have been backported\nto previous releases, but we believe they deserve special mention here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Inconsistency when Crashing Under Load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previously, when etcd was applying data, it would update the consistent-index first, followed by committing the\ndata. However, these operations were not atomic. If etcd crashed in between, it could lead to data inconsistency\n(see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766\">issue/13766</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.3 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13854\">PR/13854</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Durability API guarantee broken in single node cluster</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a client writes data and receives a success response, the data is expected to be persisted. However, the data might\nbe lost if etcd crashes immediately after sending the success response to the client. This was a legacy issue (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14370\">issue/14370</a>)\naffecting all previous releases. It was addressed in v3.4.21 and v3.5.5 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14400\">PR/14400</a>, and fixed in raft side in\nmain branch (now release-3.6) with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14413\">PR/14413</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revision Inconsistency when Crashing During Defragmentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If etcd crashed during the defragmentation operation, upon restart, it might reapply\nsome entries which had already been applied, accordingly leading to the revision inconsistency issue\n(see the discussions in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14685\">PR/14685</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.6 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14730\">PR/14730</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrade-issue\">Upgrade issue</h2>\n<p>This section highlights a common issue <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/19557\">issues/19557</a> in the etcd v3.5 to v3.6 upgrade that may cause the upgrade\nprocess to fail. For a complete upgrade guide, refer to <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue was introduced in etcd v3.5.1, and resolved in v3.5.20.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong>: users are required to first upgrade to etcd v3.5.20 (or a higher patch version) before upgrading\nto etcd v3.6.0; otherwise, the upgrade may fail.</p>\n<p>For more background and technical context, see <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue/\">upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing\">Testing</h2>\n<p>We introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness\">Robustness testing</a> to verify correctness, which has always been our top priority.\nIt plays traffic of various types and volumes against an etcd cluster, concurrently injects a random\nfailpoint, records all operations (including both requests and responses), and finally performs a\nlinearizability check. It also verifies that the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api_guarantees/#watch-apis\">Watch APIs</a> guarantees have not been violated.\nThe robustness test increases our confidence in ensuring the quality of each etcd release.</p>\n<p>We have migrated most of the etcd workflow tests to Kubernetes' Prow testing infrastructure to\ntake advantage of its benefit, such as nice dashboards for viewing test results and the ability\nfor contributors to rerun failed tests themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\n<p>While retaining all existing supported platforms, we have promoted Linux/ARM64 to Tier 1 support.\nFor more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/15951\">issues/15951</a>. For the complete list of supported platforms,\nsee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/supported-platform/\">supported-platform</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dependencies\">Dependencies</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependency-bumping-guide\">Dependency bumping guide</h3>\n<p>We have published an official guide on how to bump dependencies for etcd’s main branch and stable releases.\nIt also covers how to update the Go version. For more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/dependency_management.md\">dependency_management</a>.\nWith this guide available, any contributors can now help with dependency upgrades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-dependency-updates\">Core Dependency Updates</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt\">bbolt</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a> are two core dependencies of etcd.</p>\n<p>Both etcd v3.4 and v3.5 depend on bbolt v1.3, while etcd v3.6 depends on bbolt v1.4.</p>\n<p>For the release-3.4 and release-3.5 branches, raft is included in the etcd repository itself, so etcd v3.4 and v3.5\ndo not depend on an external raft module. Starting from etcd v3.6, raft was moved to a separate repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a>),\nand the first standalone raft release is v3.6.0.

Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn't use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require <strong>all</strong> Pods to finish successfully\nfor that Job to reach an overall succeeded state.</p>\n<p>For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>\nfield (you can only use the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code> field for an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concept/workloads/controllers/job/#completion-mode\">indexed Job</a>).\nWhich describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes.</p>\n<p>This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads.\nUsers in these areas often run numerous experiments and may only need a specific number to complete successfully, rather than requiring all of them to succeed.\nIn this case, the leader index failure is the only relevant Job exit criteria, and the outcomes for individual follower Pods are handled\nonly indirectly via the status of the leader index.\nMoreover, followers do not know when they can terminate themselves.</p>\n<p>After Job meets any <strong>Success Policy</strong>, the Job is marked as succeeded, and all Pods are terminated including the running ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The following excerpt from a Job manifest, using <code>.successPolicy.rules[0].succeededCount</code>, shows an example of\nusing a custom success policy:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/14/kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/",
      "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes v1.33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default).\nThere is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated.</p>\n<p>This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zero-value-for-sleep-action\">Zero value for Sleep action</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.29 introduced the <code>Sleep</code> action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the <code>sleep</code> command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you'd need to have the binary for the <code>sleep</code> command in your container image. This is difficult if you're using third party images.</p>\n<p>The sleep action when it was added initially didn't have support for a sleep duration of zero seconds. The <code>time.Sleep</code> which the Sleep action uses under the hood supports a duration of zero seconds. Using a negative or a zero value for the sleep returns immediately, resulting in a no-op. We wanted the same behaviour with the sleep action. This support for the zero duration was later added in v1.32, with the <code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate.</p>\n<p>The <code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate has graduated to beta in v1.33, and is now enabled by default.\nThe original Sleep action for <code>preStop</code> and <code>postStart</code> hooks is been enabled by default, starting from Kubernetes v1.30.\nWith a cluster running Kubernetes v1.33, you are able to set a\nzero duration for sleep lifecycle hooks. For a cluster with default configuration, you don't need\nto enable any feature gate to make that possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"container-stop-signals\">Container stop signals</h2>\n<p>Container runtimes such as containerd and CRI-O honor a <code>StopSignal</code> instruction in the container image definition. This can be used to specify a custom stop signal\nthat the runtime will used to terminate containers based on that image.\nStop signal configuration was not originally part of the Pod API in Kubernetes.\nUntil Kubernetes v1.33, the only way to override the stop signal for containers was by rebuilding your container image with the new custom stop signal\n(for example, specifying <code>STOPSIGNAL</code> in a <code>Containerfile</code> or <code>Dockerfile</code>).</p>\n<p>The <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate which is newly added in Kubernetes v1.33 adds stop signals to the Kubernetes API. This allows users to specify a custom stop signal in the container spec. Stop signals are added to the API as a new lifecycle along with the existing PreStop and PostStart lifecycle handlers. In order to use this feature, we expect the Pod to have the operating system specified with <code>spec.os.name</code>. This is enforced so that we can cross-validate the stop signal against the operating system and make sure that the containers in the Pod are created with a valid stop signal for the operating system the Pod is being scheduled to. For Pods scheduled on Windows nodes, only <code>SIGTERM</code> and <code>SIGKILL</code> are allowed as valid stop signals. Find the full list of signals supported in Linux nodes <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/api/core/v1/types.go#L2985-L3053\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"default-behaviour\">Default behaviour</h3>\n<p>If a container has a custom stop signal defined in its lifecycle, the container runtime would use the signal defined in the lifecycle to kill the container, given that the container runtime also supports custom stop signals. If there is no custom stop signal defined in the container lifecycle, the runtime would fallback to the stop signal defined in the container image. If there is no stop signal defined in the container image, the default stop signal of the runtime would be used. The default signal is <code>SIGTERM</code> for both containerd and CRI-O.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-skew\">Version skew</h3>\n<p>For the feature to work as intended, both the versions of Kubernetes and the container runtime should support container stop signals. The changes to the Kuberentes API and kubelet are available in alpha stage from v1.33, which can be enabled with the <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate. The container runtime implementations for containerd and CRI-O are still a work in progress and will be rolled out soon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-container-stop-signals\">Using container stop signals</h3>\n<p>To enable this feature, you need to turn on the <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in both the kube-apiserver and the kubelet. Once you have nodes where the feature gate is turned on, you can create Pods with a StopSignal lifecycle and a valid OS name like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Pod<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">os</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>linux<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">containers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx:latest<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">lifecycle</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">stopSignal</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>SIGUSR1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Do note that the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal in this example can only be used if the container's Pod is scheduled to a Linux node.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"image-pull-policy-the-way-you-always-thought-it-worked\">Image Pull Policy the way you always thought it worked!</h2>\n<p>Some things in Kubernetes are surprising, and the way <code>imagePullPolicy</code> behaves might\nbe one of them. Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar\nto learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for\nover 10 years in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/18787\">issue 18787</a>!\nIt is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note:</h4>Throughout this blog post, the term &quot;pod credentials&quot; will be used often. In this context,\nthe term generally encapsulates the authentication material that is available to a pod\nto authenticate a container image pull.</div>\n<h2 id=\"ifnotpresent-even-if-i-m-not-supposed-to-have-it\">IfNotPresent, even if I'm not supposed to have it</h2>\n<p>The gist of the problem is that the <code>imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code> strategy has done\nprecisely what it says, and nothing more. Let's set up a scenario. To begin, <em>Pod A</em> in <em>Namespace X</em> is scheduled to <em>Node 1</em> and requires <em>image Foo</em> from a private repository.\nFor it's image pull authentication material, the pod references <em>Secret 1</em> in its <code>imagePullSecrets</code>. <em>Secret 1</em> contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from <em>Secret 1</em> as supplied by <em>Pod A</em>\nand it will pull <em>container image Foo</em> from the registry. This is the intended (and secure)\nbehavior.</p>\n<p>But now things get curious. If <em>Pod B</em> in <em>Namespace Y</em> happens to also be scheduled to <em>Node 1</em>, unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. <em>Pod B</em> may reference the same private image, specifying the <code>IfNotPresent</code> image pull policy. <em>Pod B</em> does not reference <em>Secret 1</em>\n(or in our case, any secret) in its <code>imagePullSecrets</code>. When the Kubelet tries to run the pod, it honors the <code>IfNotPresent</code> policy. The Kubelet sees that the <em>image Foo</em> is already present locally, and will provide <em>image Foo</em> to <em>Pod B</em>. <em>Pod B</em> gets to run the image even though it did not provide credentials authorizing it to pull the image in the first place.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Illustration of the process of two pods trying to access a private image, the first one with a pull secret, the second one without it\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/12/kubernetes-v1-33-ensure-secret-pulled-images-alpha/ensure_secret_image_pulls.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Using a private image pulled by a different pod</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>While <code>IfNotPresent</code> should not pull <em>image Foo</em> if it is already present\non the node, it is an incorrect security posture to allow all pods scheduled\nto a node to have access to previously pulled private image. These pods were never\nauthorized to pull the image in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ifnotpresent-but-only-if-i-am-supposed-to-have-it\">IfNotPresent, but only if I am supposed to have it</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.33, we - SIG Auth and SIG Node - have finally started to address this (really old) problem and getting the verification right! The basic expected behavior is not changed. If\nan image is not present, the Kubelet will attempt to pull the image. The credentials each pod supplies will be utilized for this task. This matches behavior prior to 1.33.</p>\n<p>If the image is present, then the behavior of the Kubelet changes. The Kubelet will now\nverify the pod's credentials before allowing the pod to use the image.</p>\n<p>Performance and service stability have been a consideration while revising the feature.\nPods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate. This is\nalso true when pods source credentials from the same Kubernetes Secret object, even\nwhen the credentials are rotated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"never-pull-but-use-if-authorized\">Never pull, but use if authorized</h2>\n<p>The <code>imagePullPolicy: Never</code> option does not fetch images. However, if the\ncontainer image is already present on the node, any pod attempting to use the private\nimage will be required to provide credentials, and those credentials require verification.</p>\n<p>Pods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate.\nPods that do not supply credentials previously used to successfully pull an\nimage will not be allowed to use the private image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"always-pull-if-authorized\">Always pull, if authorized</h2>\n<p>The <code>imagePullPolicy: Always</code> has always worked as intended. Each time an image\nis requested, the request goes to the registry and the registry will perform an authentication\ncheck.</p>\n<p>In the past, forcing the <code>Always</code> image pull policy via pod admission was the only way to ensure\nthat your private container images didn't get reused by other pods on nodes which already pulled the images.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this was somewhat performant. Only the image manifest was pulled, not the image. However, there was still a cost and a risk. During a new rollout, scale up, or pod restart, the image registry that provided the image MUST be available for the auth check, putting the image registry in the critical path for stability of services running inside of the cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-all-works\">How it all works</h2>\n<p>The feature is based on persistent, file-based caches that are present on each of\nthe nodes. The following is a simplified description of how the feature works.\nFor the complete version, please see <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535</a>.</p>\n<p>The process of requesting an image for the first time goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A pod requesting an image from a private registry is scheduled to a node.</li>\n<li>The image is not present on the node.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet makes a record of the intention to pull the image.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet extracts credentials from the Kubernetes Secret referenced by the pod\nas an image pull secret, and uses them to pull the image from the private registry.</li>\n<li>After the image has been successfully pulled, the Kubelet makes a record of\nthe successful pull. This record includes details about credentials used\n(in the form of a hash) as well as the Secret from which they originated.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet removes the original record of intent.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet retains the record of successful pull for later use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When future pods scheduled to the same node request the previously pulled private image:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Kubelet checks the credentials that the new pod provides for the pull.</li>\n<li>If the hash of these credentials, or the source Secret of the credentials match\nthe hash or source Secret which were recorded for a previous successful pull,\nthe pod is allowed to use the previously pulled image.</li>\n<li>If the credentials or their source Secret are not found in the records of\nsuccessful pulls for that image, the Kubelet will attempt to use\nthese new credentials to request a pull from the remote registry, triggering\nthe authorization flow.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.33 we shipped the alpha version of this feature.

      "summary": "<p>Managing Kubernetes cluster stability becomes increasingly critical as your infrastructure grows. One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster's stability.</p>\n<p>Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-unnecessary-memory-consumption-with-large-resources\">The problem: unnecessary memory consumption with large resources</h2>\n<p>Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ResponseWriter.Write\">ResponseWriter.Write</a> call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2's capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally.</p>\n<p>When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body’s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability.</p>\n<p>The encoding/json package uses sync.Pool to reuse memory buffers during serialization. While efficient for consistent workloads, this mechanism creates challenges with sporadic large List responses. When processing these large responses, memory pools expand significantly. But due to sync.Pool's design, these oversized buffers remain reserved after use. Subsequent small List requests continue utilizing these large memory allocations, preventing garbage collection and maintaining persistently high memory consumption in the kube-apiserver even after the initial large responses complete.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protocolbuffers.github.io/blob/c14731f55296f8c6367faa4f2e55a3d3594544c6/content/programming-guides/techniques.md?plain=1#L39\">Protocol Buffers</a> are not designed to handle large datasets. But it’s great for handling <strong>individual</strong> messages within a large data set. This highlights the need for streaming-based approaches that can process and transmit large collections incrementally rather than as monolithic blocks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>As a general rule of thumb, if you are dealing in messages larger than a megabyte each, it may be time to consider an alternate strategy.</em></p>\n<p><em>From <a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/techniques/\">https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/techniques/</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"streaming-encoder-for-list-responses\">Streaming encoder for List responses</h2>\n<p>The streaming encoding mechanism is specifically designed for List responses, leveraging their common well-defined collection structures. The core idea focuses exclusively on the <strong>Items</strong> field within collection structures, which represents the bulk of memory consumption in large responses. Rather than encoding the entire <strong>Items</strong> array as one contiguous memory block, the new streaming encoder processes and transmits each item individually, allowing memory to be freed progressively as frame or chunk is transmitted. As a result, encoding items one by one significantly reduces the memory footprint required by the API server.</p>\n<p>With Kubernetes objects typically limited to 1.5 MiB (from ETCD), streaming encoding keeps memory consumption predictable and manageable regardless of how many objects are in a List response. The result is significantly improved API server stability, reduced memory spikes, and better overall cluster performance - especially in environments where multiple large List operations might occur simultaneously.</p>\n<p>To ensure perfect backward compatibility, the streaming encoder validates Go struct tags rigorously before activation, guaranteeing byte-for-byte consistency with the original encoder. Standard encoding mechanisms process all fields except <strong>Items</strong>, maintaining identical output formatting throughout. This approach seamlessly supports all Kubernetes List types—from built-in <strong>*List</strong> objects to Custom Resource <strong>UnstructuredList</strong> objects - requiring zero client-side modifications or awareness that the underlying encoding method has changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance-gains-you-ll-notice\">Performance gains you'll notice</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Memory Consumption:</strong> Significantly lowers the memory footprint of the API server when handling large <strong>list</strong> requests,\nespecially when dealing with <strong>large resources</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Scalability:</strong> Enables the API server to handle more concurrent requests and larger datasets without running out of memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Stability:</strong> Reduces the risk of OOM kills and service disruptions.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficient Resource Utilization:</strong> Optimizes memory usage and improves overall resource efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"benchmark-results\">Benchmark results</h2>\n<p>To validate results Kubernetes has introduced a new <strong>list</strong> benchmark which executes concurrently 10 <strong>list</strong> requests each returning 1GB of data.</p>\n<p>The benchmark has showed 20x improvement, reducing memory usage from 70-80GB to 3GB.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of a K8s performance dashboard showing memory usage for benchmark list going down from 60GB to 3GB\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/09/kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/results.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>List benchmark memory usage</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>",

these leaks happened due to limitations in finalizer handling.\nAhead of the graduation to general availability, the Kubernetes project added support to delete temporary resources (PVC prime, etc.) if the original PVC is deleted.</p>\n<p>To accommodate this, we've introduced three new plugin-based functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>PopulateFn()</code>: Executes the provider-specific data population logic.</li>\n<li><code>PopulateCompleteFn()</code>: Checks if the data population operation has finished successfully.</li>\n<li><code>PopulateCleanupFn()</code>: Cleans up temporary resources created by the provider-specific functions after data population is completed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A provider example is added in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/lib-volume-populator/tree/master/example\">lib-volume-populator/example</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mutator-functions-to-modify-the-kubernetes-resources\">Mutator functions to modify the Kubernetes resources</h3>\n<p>For GA, the CSI volume populator controller code gained a <code>MutatorConfig</code>, allowing the specification of mutator functions to modify Kubernetes resources.\nFor example, if the PVC prime is not an exact copy of the PVC and you need provider-specific information for the driver, you can include this information in the optional <code>MutatorConfig</code>.\nThis allows you to customize the Kubernetes objects in the volume populator.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flexible-metric-handling-for-providers\">Flexible metric handling for providers</h3>\n<p>Our beta phase highlighted a new requirement: the need to aggregate metrics not just from lib-volume-populator, but also from other components within the provider's codebase.</p>\n<p>To address this, SIG Storage introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/lib-volume-populator/blob/8a922a5302fdba13a6c27328ee50e5396940214b/populator-machinery/controller.go#L122\">provider metric manager</a>.\nThis enhancement delegates the implementation of metrics logic to the provider itself, rather than relying solely on lib-volume-populator.\nThis shift provides greater flexibility and control over metrics collection and aggregation, enabling a more comprehensive view of provider performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clean-up-for-temporary-resources\">Clean up for temporary resources</h3>\n<p>During the beta phase, we identified potential resource leaks with PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) deletion while volume population was in progress, due to limitations in finalizer handling. We have improved the populator to support the deletion of temporary resources (PVC prime, etc.) if the original PVC is deleted in this GA release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-it\">How to use it</h2>\n<p>To try it out, please follow the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/16/volume-populators-beta/#trying-it-out\">steps</a> in the previous beta blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-directions-and-potential-feature-requests\">Future directions and potential feature requests</h2>\n<p>For next step, there are several potential feature requests for volume populator:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi sync: the current implementation is a one-time unidirectional sync from source to destination. This can be extended to support multiple syncs, enabling periodic syncs or allowing users to sync on demand</li>\n<li>Bidirectional sync: an extension of multi sync above, but making it bidirectional between source and destination</li>\n<li>Populate data with priorities: with a list of different dataSourceRef, populate based on priorities</li>\n<li>Populate data from multiple sources of the same provider: populate multiple different sources to one destination</li>\n<li>Populate data from multiple sources of the different providers: populate multiple different sources to one destination, pipelining different resources’ population</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure we're building something truly valuable, Kubernetes SIG Storage would love to hear about any specific use cases you have in mind for this feature.\nFor any inquiries or specific questions related to volume populator, please reach out to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-storage\">SIG Storage community</a>.</p>",

That's why we are thrilled to be named a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/forrester-wave-devops-platform/\"><strong>Leader in The Forrester Wave™: DevOps Platforms, Q2 2025</strong></a>, receiving the highest scores possible across the criteria our customers tell us they care about most, including day zero experience, developer tooling, build automation and CI, deployment automation, AI risk mitigation, AI infusion, directly incorporated security tools, and platform cohesion.</p>\n<p><em><strong>&quot;GitLab is the most all-in-one of the all-in-one solutions and suits enterprises looking to standardize with a single purchase.” -</strong></em> Forrester Wave™: DevOps Platforms, Q2 2025</p>\n<p>For us, this recognition reflects what we've been hearing from customers: They need to deliver secure software faster, but existing solutions force them to compromise on speed, security, or simplicity. GitLab delivers all three. And with our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/05/15/gitlab-18-0-released/\">GitLab 18.0 release</a> in May, we’ve taken this a step further by <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/05/15/gitlab-premium-with-duo/\">including AI-native GitLab Duo capabilities</a> — such as test generation, code suggestions, and code refactoring — directly in GitLab Premium and GitLab Ultimate at no additional cost.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/forrester-wave-devops-platform/\">Access the report today!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\" Forrester Wave™: DevOps Platforms, Q2 2025 graphic \" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2dleAPmTGRpmyUdQAw2mvZ/86cee430e31ef0c247c4f9d5fca4463e/Image_DevOps-Platforms-Q2-2025.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Staying at the forefront of AI transformation, with enterprise control</h2>\n<p>DevSecOps is rapidly evolving, with AI at the forefront of that change. Unfortunately, many AI tools force a choice: cutting-edge capabilities or enterprise security.</p>\n<p>Forrester scored GitLab a 5 – the highest on their scale – for both the <strong>AI infusion</strong> and <strong>AI risk mitigation</strong> criteria. We’re pleased to see our focus on building innovative AI capabilities that maintain security is being noticed by more than just our customers.</p>\n<p>This dual strength shows up across our GitLab Duo AI offerings, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duo Workflow (private beta): Autonomous AI agents that handle complex tasks across development, security, and operations — with enterprise-grade guardrails and audit trails.</li>\n<li>Agentic Chat: Contextual, conversational AI assistance for everything from code explanations to test creation — with IP protection and privacy controls built in.</li>\n<li>Code Suggestions: AI assistance that can predictively complete code blocks, define function logic, generate tests, and propose common code like regex patterns.</li>\n<li>AI-native Vulnerability Resolution: Find and fix vulnerabilities with auto explanation and auto-generated merge requests, ensuring a streamlined development process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Doing more with less</h2>\n<p>We’ve heard loud and clear that DevSecOps teams don’t need more tools and integrations that help them with part of their software delivery lifecycle. They need a seamless, integrated developer experience that covers the entire SDLC.</p>\n<p>We believe GitLab’s scores in the following criteria are validation of our customer-focused strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Day zero experience:</strong> Forrester cited our “strong day zero experience,” noting that “everything is ready to run out-of-the-box,” supported by extensive migration tools and tutorials.</li>\n<li><strong>Developer tooling:</strong> Forrester pointed to <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/17/gitlab-duo-with-amazon-q-agentic-ai-optimized-for-aws/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</a>, our agentic AI offering for AWS customers, as well as our cloud development environment, integrated developer platform, and wikis for documentation as examples.</li>\n<li><strong>Project planning and alignment:</strong> Forrester noted our &quot;strong compliance center,&quot; and that we have tools to drive alignment top-down and bottom-up.</li>\n<li><strong>Pipeline security:</strong> Forrester gave us the highest score possible in the pipeline security criterion.</li>\n<li><strong>Build automation and CI:</strong> Forrester cited our build automation and CI with multistage build pipelines and strong self-hosted support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Read the report</h2>\n<p>For us, being named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: DevOps Platforms, Q2 2025 speaks to the breadth and depth of our platform’s capabilities, providing a single source of truth for the entire software development lifecycle.

      "summary": "<p>In today’s modern software development landscape, many organizations are migrating to the cloud and adopting DevSecOps processes. However, this transition presents a significant challenge: a proliferation of tools and legacy systems not designed for modern development. To adapt these systems to DevSecOps, organizations must create integrations between multiple tools for task management, CI/CD, security, monitoring, and more. The result? Operational complexity, high maintenance costs, and disrupted collaboration between development and operations teams. Additionally, developers experience frustration as they constantly switch between different tools to complete a single development flow – from planning to production.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The complexity and operational costs of integrating multiple tools into a DevSecOps process\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2St6IpZOhWumZRBuiPh5lO/e1927a696756921dc7f8c3cb4b499702/image1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;How complex it can be to integrate multiple tools into a DevSecOps process&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>The good news is that a solution exists: A comprehensive DevSecOps platform offering a unified approach to software development.</p>\n<p>These platforms are built for organizations operating in cloud-based and DevSecOps environments, consolidating all software development stages — from code management, CI/CD processes, task management, and security to AI-driven automation — into a single platform. Centralizing all software development workflows in a unified interface enables development and operations teams to work more efficiently, streamline communication, and minimize operational complexities and disruptions.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the developer experience significantly improves — engineers are much happier working with a product designed specifically for modern development needs.</p>\n<p>In the sections below, we’ll explore how GitLab helps teams overcome common challenges — whether it’s managing projects and tasks, ensuring security and compliance, or adopting AI-powered development tools – all within a single, unified platform.</p>\n<h2>Integrated Agile project management</h2>\n<p>GitLab provides a holistic solution in which project and task management are fully integrated across all stages of the software development lifecycle, such as CI/CD, enabling real-time tracking of development progress. Issues and epics directly link to automation processes, allowing a seamless flow from planning to production deployment. This approach enhances transparency across teams, reduces delays, and ensures that all stakeholders have a clear view of the development status in real-time.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Issues and epics directly link to automation processes, allowing a seamless flow from planning to production deployment.\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/1ASYGKWYcd8ofkeW28GkXm/3f85f071ff7604fee2d2de1e3a299f3a/image3.jpg\" /></p>\n<h2>Built-in security</h2>\n<p>GitLab strongly emphasizes integrating security capabilities end-to-end (security first). The platform integrates a wide range of automated security scanners, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/\">Dependency Scanning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/\">Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dast/\">Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/\">Secret Detection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/container_scanning/\">Container Scanning</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Security scanning capabilities integrated into the CI/CD process at various development stages\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4dfcfO9NwyMqg4TjKubH8C/3296c50acc1ee7fc0d7b3645f4617e67/image2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Security scanning capabilities integrated into the CI/CD process at various development stages&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>These security checks are built directly into every phase of the software development lifecycle, including the CI/CD pipeline, to provide developers with immediate feedback on potential security issues early in the development cycle.</p>\n<h2>Compliance and regulatory requirements</h2>\n<p>Beyond efficiency and user experience, many organizations — especially those in regulated industries such as financial institutions or large enterprises — must ensure their processes comply with strict security and compliance standards. They need the ability to enforce policies for different projects, such as mandating a security scanner every time a CI/CD pipeline runs on specific code branches (e.g., main or protected branches) or requiring specific approvals before merging code into the main branch.</p>\n<p>With GitLab, this becomes easier through <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/17/introducing-custom-compliance-frameworks-in-gitlab/\">Compliance Frameworks</a>, a feature that allows organizations to define and enforce structured policies for selected projects. This ensures compliance with automatic regulatory and security requirements while maintaining a seamless and efficient developer workflow.</p>\n<h2>AI-powered development</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a> provides AI-driven assistance across all development stages, eliminating the need to switch to external tools. Every AI-powered request is processed within the full context of the project and codebase, enabling smarter and more efficient work.</p>\n<p>AI can perform example tasks such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatic task description generation</li>\n<li>smart summarization of issue discussions, saving developers valuable time</li>\n<li>advanced code review capabilities</li>\n<li>code improvement and optimization suggestions</li>\n<li>automated test generation</li>\n<li>security vulnerability detection and remediation</li>\n<li>troubleshooting root cause analysis for CI pipeline failures</li>\n<li>privacy and Data Security</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding the needs of regulated organizations, particularly in the public and financial sectors, GitLab offers a unique solution for running AI models in a secure environment.

      "summary": "<p>Code reviews are critical for catching bugs, improving code readability, and maintaining coding standards, but they can also be a major bottleneck in your workflow. When you're trying to ship features quickly, waiting for multiple team members to review your code can be frustrating. The back-and-forth discussions, the scheduling conflicts, and the time it takes to get everyone aligned can stretch what should be a simple review into days or even weeks.</p>\n<p>Here's where <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/17/gitlab-duo-with-amazon-q-agentic-ai-optimized-for-aws/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</a>, our new offering that delivers agentic AI throughout the software development lifecycle for AWS customers, comes in to transform your review process. This intelligent, AI-powered solution can perform comprehensive code reviews for you in a fraction of the time it would take your human colleagues. By leveraging advanced agentic AI capabilities, GitLab Duo with Amazon Q streamlines your entire review workflow without sacrificing the quality and thoroughness you need. Think of it as having an always-available, highly skilled reviewer who can instantly analyze your code and provide actionable feedback.</p>\n<h2>How it works: Launching a code review</h2>\n<p>So how does GitLab Duo with Amazon Q actually work? Let's say you've just finished working on a feature and created a merge request with multiple code updates. Instead of pinging your teammates and waiting for their availability, you simply enter a quick command in the comment section: &quot;/q review&quot;. That's it – just those two words trigger the AI to spring into action.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Triggering a code review using GitLab Duo with Amazon Q\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3ttr4gSL6OFRiwWI8ikbXR/a48fae751c55ee0b012c86fb28aba425/image1.png\" /></p>\n<p>Once you've entered the command, Amazon Q Service immediately begins analyzing your code changes. You'll see a confirmation that the review is underway, and within moments, the AI is examining every line of your updates, checking for potential issues across multiple dimensions.\nWhen the review completes, you receive comprehensive feedback that covers all the bases: bug detection, readability improvements, syntax errors, and adherence to your team's coding standards.

      "summary": "<p>Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing DevOps and DevSecOps approaches by simplifying complex tasks, such as code creation, log analysis, and vulnerability detection.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn how LLMs work, their practical applications, and the main challenges to overcome in order to fully harness their potential.</p>\n<h2>What is an LLM?</h2>\n<p>LLMs are artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can process and generate text autonomously. They are trained by analyzing vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, enabling them to master the linguistic structures, contextual relationships, and nuances of language.</p>\n<p>LLMs are a major breakthrough in the field of AI. Their ability to process, generate, and interpret text relies on sophisticated machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. These systems do not just process individual words; they analyze complex sequences to capture the overall meaning, subtle contexts, and linguistic nuances.</p>\n<h2>How do LLMs work?</h2>\n<p>To better understand how they work, let's explore some of the key features of large language models.</p>\n<h3>Supervised and unsupervised learning</h3>\n<p>LLMs are trained using two complementary approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. These two approaches to machine learning maximize their ability to analyze and generate text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supervised learning</strong> relies on labeled data, where each input is associated with an expected output. The model learns to associate these inputs with the correct outputs by adjusting its internal parameters to reduce prediction errors. Through this approach, the model acquires precise knowledge about specific tasks, such as text classification or named entity recognition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unsupervised learning (or machine learning)</strong>, on the other hand, does not require labeled data. The model explores large volumes of text to discover hidden structures and identify semantic relationships. The model is therefore able to learn recurring patterns, implicit grammatical rules in the text, and contextualization of sentences and concepts. This method allows LLMs to be trained on large corpora of data, greatly accelerating their progress without direct human action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By combining these two approaches, large language models gain the advantages of both precise, human-guided learning and unlimited autonomous exploration. This complementarity allows them to develop rapidly, while continuously improving their ability to understand and generate text coherently and contextually.</p>\n<h3>Learning based on a large volume of data</h3>\n<p>LLMs are trained on billions of sentences from a variety of sources, such as news articles, online forums, technical documentation, scientific studies, and more. This variety of sources allows them to acquire a broad and nuanced understanding of natural language, ranging from everyday expressions to specialized terminology.</p>\n<p>The richness of the data used is a key factor in LLMs' performance. Each source brings different writing styles, cultural contexts, and levels of technicality.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>News articles</strong> to master informative and factual language</li>\n<li><strong>Online forums</strong> to understand specialized communities' informal conversations and technical language</li>\n<li><strong>Technical documentation and scientific studies</strong> to assimilate complex concepts and specific terminology, particularly in areas such as DevOps and DevSecOps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This diversity of content allows LLMs to recognize complex linguistic structures, interpret sentences in different contexts, and adapt to highly technical domains. In DevSecOps, this means understanding commands, configurations, security protocols, and even concepts related to the development and maintenance of computer systems.</p>\n<p>With this large-scale training, LLMs can accurately answer complex questions, write technical documentation, or identify vulnerabilities in computer systems.</p>\n<h3>Neural network architecture and &quot;deep learning&quot;</h3>\n<p>LLMs are based on advanced neural network architectures. These networks are specially designed to process large sequences of text while maintaining an accurate understanding of the context. This deep learning-based training is a major asset in the field of NLP.</p>\n<p>The best-known of these structures is the architecture of sequence-to-sequence models (transformers). This architecture has revolutionized NLP with its ability to simultaneously analyze all parts of a text, unlike sequential approaches that process words one by one.</p>\n<p>Sequence-to-sequence models excel at processing long texts. For example, in a conversation or a detailed technical document, they are able to link distant information in the text to produce precise and well-reasoned answers. This context management is essential in a DevSecOps approach, where instructions can be complex and spread over multiple lines of code or configuration steps.</p>\n<h3>Predictive text generation</h3>\n<p>When the user submits a text, query, or question, an LLM uses its predictive ability to generate the most likely sequence, based on the context provided.</p>\n<p>The model analyzes each word, studies grammatical and semantic relationships, and then selects the most suitable terms to produce a coherent and informative text. This approach makes it possible to generate precise, detailed responses adapted to the expected tone.</p>\n<p>In DevSecOps environments, this capability becomes particularly useful for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coding assistance:</strong> generation of code blocks or scripts adapted to specific configurations</li>\n<li><strong>Technical problem solving:</strong> proposing solutions based on descriptions of bugs or errors</li>\n<li><strong>Drafting technical documentation:</strong> automatic creation of guides, manuals, or instructions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Predictive text generation thus makes it possible to automate many repetitive tasks and speed up technical teams' work.</p>\n<h2>Applications of large language models in a DevSecOps approach</h2>\n<p>With the rise of automation, LLMs have become indispensable allies for technical teams. Their ability to understand and generate text contextually enables them to effectively operate in complex environments such as <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devsecops/\">DevSecOps</a>.</p>\n<p>With their analytical power and ability to adapt to specific needs, these models offer tailored solutions to streamline processes and lighten technical teams' workload.</p>\n<p>Development teams can leverage LLMs to automatically transform functional specifications into source code.</p>\n<p>With this capability, they can perform the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>generate complex automation scripts</li>\n<li>create CI/CD pipelines tailored to specific business processes</li>\n<li>produce customized security patches</li>\n<li>generate code explanation and create documentation</li>\n<li>refactor code by improving code structure and readability without changing functionality</li>\n<li>generate tests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By relying on LLMs, teams are able to accelerate the development of their software while reducing the risk of human error.</p>\n<h3>Improved documentation and knowledge sharing</h3>\n<p>These powerful tools make it easy to create customized user manuals, API descriptions, and tutorials that are perfectly tailored to each user's level of expertise. By leveraging existing knowledge bases, LLMs create contextual answers to frequently asked questions. This enhances knowledge sharing within teams, speeds up onboarding of new members, and helps centralize best practices.</p>\n<h3>Incident management and troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>During an incident, LLMs play a crucial role in analyzing logs and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/tracing.html\">trace files</a> in real time. Thanks to their ability to cross-reference information from multiple sources, they identify anomalies and propose solutions based on similar past incidents. This approach significantly reduces diagnosis time. In addition, LLMs can automate the creation of detailed incident reports and recommend specific corrective actions.</p>\n<h3>Creating and improving CI/CD pipelines</h3>\n<p>LLMs are revolutionizing the configuration of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/cicd-pipeline/\">CI/CD pipelines</a>. They can not only help create pipelines, but also automate this process and suggest optimal configurations based on industry standards. By adapting workflows to your specific needs, they ensure perfect consistency between different development environments. Automated testing is enhanced by relevant suggestions, limiting the risk of failure. LLMs also continuously monitor the efficiency of pipelines and adjust processes to ensure smooth and uninterrupted rollout.</p>\n<h3>Security and compliance</h3>\n<p>In a DevSecOps environment, large language models become valuable allies for security and compliance. They parse the source code for potential vulnerabilities and generate detailed patch recommendations. LLMs can also monitor the application of security standards in real time, produce comprehensive compliance reports, and automate the application of security patches as soon as a vulnerability is identified. This automation enhances overall security and ensures consistent compliance with legal and industry requirements.</p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of large language models?</h2>\n<p>LLMs are radically reshaping DevOps and DevSecOps approaches, bringing substantial improvements in productivity, security, and software quality. By integrating with existing workflows, LLMs are disrupting traditional approaches by automating complex tasks and providing innovative solutions.</p>\n<h3>Improved productivity and efficiency</h3>\n<p>LLMs play a central role in improving technical teams' productivity and efficiency. By automating a wide range of repetitive tasks, they free development teams from routine operations, allowing them to focus on strategic activities with higher added value.</p>\n<p>In addition, LLMs act as intelligent technical assistants capable of instantly providing relevant code snippets, tailored to the specific context of each project. In this way, they significantly reduce research time by offering ready-to-use solutions to assist teams in their work. This targeted assistance speeds up problem solving and reduces disruptions in workflows.\nAs a result, productivity increases and projects move forward more quickly. Technical teams can take on more tasks without compromising the quality of deliverables.</p>\n<h3>Improved code quality and security</h3>\n<p>The use of large language models in software development is a major lever for improving both code quality and application security. With their advanced analytical capabilities, LLMs can scan source code line by line and instantly detect syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and potential vulnerabilities. Their ability to recognize defective code allows them to recommend appropriate fixes that comply with industry best practices.</p>\n<p>LLMs also play a key preventive role. They excel at identifying complex security flaws that are often difficult for humans to detect. By analyzing dependencies, they can flag obsolete or vulnerable libraries and recommend more secure, up-to-date versions. This approach contributes to maintaining a secure environment that complies with current security standards.</p>\n<p>Beyond fixing existing errors, LLMs offer improvements by suggesting optimized coding practices and project structures. They can generate code that meets the most advanced security standards from the earliest stages of development.</p>\n<h3>Accelerating development lifecycles</h3>\n<p>Large language models play a key role in accelerating software development lifecycles by automating key tasks that would otherwise tie up valuable human resources. Complex and repetitive tasks, such as writing functions, creating unit tests, or implementing standard components, are automated in a matter of moments.</p>\n<p>LLMs also speed up the validation phase with their ability to suggest complete and appropriate test cases. They ensure broader test coverage in less time, reducing the risk of errors and enabling early detection of anomalies. This preventive approach shortens the correction cycle and limits delays related to code quality issues.</p>\n<p>By simplifying technical tasks and providing fast and tailored solutions, large language models enable businesses to respond to market demands in a more agile way. This acceleration of the development lifecycle results in more frequent updates, faster iterations, and a better ability to adapt products to users' changing needs.</p>\n<p>Development lifecycles are becoming shorter, providing a critical strategic advantage in an increasingly demanding technology landscape.</p>\n<h2>What are the challenges of using LLMs?</h2>\n<p>Despite their many benefits, large language models have certain limitations that require careful management. Their effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the data used during their training and regular updates to their knowledge bases. In addition, issues related to algorithmic bias, data security, and privacy can arise, exposing companies to operational and legal risks. Rigorous human oversight remains essential in order to ensure the reliability of results, maintain regulatory compliance, and prevent critical errors.</p>\n<h3>Data privacy and security</h3>\n<p>Training LLMs relies on large volumes of data, often from diverse sources, raising questions about the protection of confidential information. Sensitive data shared with cloud platforms can therefore be exposed to potential breaches. This is of particular concern to companies operating in regulated sectors.</p>\n<p>In Europe, where strict regulations like GDPR govern data management, many companies are reluctant to transfer their information to external services. Regulatory requirements, coupled with the fear of unauthorized exploitation of sensitive data, have led some companies to opt for self-hosted solutions to maintain complete control over their systems.</p>\n<p>Providers like GitLab have put in place robust security guarantees, such as intentional non-retention of personal data and end-to-end encryption. However, this may not be enough for the most demanding customers, who prefer complete control of their environments. Implementing hybrid or on-premises solutions then becomes a strategic necessity to meet the security requirements of certain companies.</p>\n<p>Learn more about GitLab Duo Self-Hosted by clicking on the image below to access our product tour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.navattic.com/gitlab-duo-self-hosted\"><img alt=\"GitLab Duo Self-Hosted tour\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/75hcBwFQD6fIkujdi4q3e0/c93bdc1d6873e9aaf78c26289f1971d1/Screenshot_2025-05-29_at_8.29.30%C3%A2__AM.png\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Accuracy and reliability</h3>\n<p>Although large language models are capable of producing impressive results, their performance is not infallible. They can produce incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent answers. This inaccuracy becomes particularly problematic in the context of critical tasks such as generating security code or analyzing sensitive data.</p>\n<p>In addition, LLMs operate on the basis of probabilistic models, which means that they do not truly &quot;understand&quot; the content they process, but produce predictions based on statistical probabilities. This can lead to technically incorrect or even dangerous recommendations when used without human validation.</p>\n<p>To avoid these pitfalls, it is essential to maintain constant oversight and establish rigorous validation processes. The results provided by LLMs must always be reviewed by humans before being integrated into critical systems.</p>\n<p>A strategy of regular model updates, combined with proactive human oversight, can reduce errors and gradually improve the reliability of results.</p>\n<h2>How GitLab uses LLMs for GitLab Duo features</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a> harnesses the power of large language models to transform DevSecOps processes by integrating AI-powered capabilities throughout the software development lifecycle.

Now, let's dive deeper into the world of <strong>CI/CD variables</strong> and unlock their full potential.</p>\n<h3>What are CI/CD variables?</h3>\n<p>CI/CD variables are dynamic key-value pairs that you can define at different levels within your GitLab environment (e.g., project, group, or instance). These variables act as placeholders for values that you can use in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file to customize your pipelines, securely store sensitive information, and make your CI/CD configuration more maintainable.</p>\n<h3>Why are CI/CD variables important?</h3>\n<p>CI/CD variables offer numerous benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - Easily adapt your pipelines to different environments, configurations, or deployment targets without modifying your core CI/CD script.</li>\n<li><strong>Security</strong> - Securely store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens, preventing them from being exposed directly in your code.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintainability</strong> - Keep your CI/CD configuration clean and organized by centralizing values in variables, making updates and modifications easier.</li>\n<li><strong>Reusability</strong> - Define variables once and reuse them across multiple projects, promoting consistency and reducing duplication.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scopes of CI/CD variables: Project, group, and instance</h3>\n<p>GitLab allows you to define CI/CD variables with different scopes, controlling their visibility and accessibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Project-level variables</strong> - These variables are specific to a single project and are ideal for storing project-specific settings, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployment URLs: Define different URLs for staging and production environments.</li>\n<li>Database credentials: Store database connection details for testing or deployment.</li>\n<li>Feature flags: Enable or disable features during different stages of your pipeline.</li>\n<li>Example: You have a project called &quot;MyWebApp&quot; and want to store the production deployment URL. You create a project-level variable named <code>DPROD_DEPLOY_URL</code> with the value <code>https://mywebapp.com</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Group-level variables</strong> - These variables are shared across all projects within a GitLab group. They are useful for settings that are common to multiple projects, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API keys for shared services: Store API keys for services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Docker Hub that are used by multiple projects within the group.</li>\n<li>Global configuration settings: Define common configuration parameters that apply to all projects in the group.</li>\n<li>Example: You have a group called &quot;Web Apps&quot; and want to store an API key for Docker Hub. You create a group-level variable named <code>DOCKER_HUB_API_KEY</code> with the corresponding API key value.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instance-level variables</strong> - These variables are available to all projects on a GitLab instance. They are typically used for global settings that apply across an entire organization such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default runner registration token: Provide a default token for registering new <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/\">runners</a>.</li>\n<li>License information: Store license keys for GitLab features or third-party tools.</li>\n<li>Global environment settings: Define environment variables that should be available to all projects.</li>\n<li>Example: You want to set a default Docker image for all projects on your GitLab instance. You create an instance-level variable named <code>DEFAULT_DOCKER_IMAGE</code> with the value <code>ubuntu:latest</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defining CI/CD variables</h3>\n<p>To define a CI/CD variable:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Settings &gt; CI/CD</strong> buttons for  your project, group, or instance.</li>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Variables</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Add variable</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter the <strong>key</strong> (e.g., <code>API_KEY</code>) and <strong>value</strong>.</li>\n<li>Optionally, check the <strong>Protect variable</strong> box for sensitive information. This ensures that the variable is only available to pipelines running on protected branches or tags.</li>\n<li>Optionally, check the <strong>Mask variable</strong> box to hide the variable's value from job logs, preventing accidental exposure.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Save variable</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Using CI/CD variables</h3>\n<p>To use a CI/CD variable in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file, simply prefix the variable name with <code>$</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">deploy_job:\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Deploying to production...&quot;\n    - curl -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY&quot; https://api.example.com/deploy\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Predefined CI/CD variables</h3>\n<p>GitLab provides a set of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/predefined_variables/\">predefined CI/CD variables</a> that you can use in your pipelines. These variables provide information about the current pipeline, job, project, and more.</p>\n<p>Some commonly used predefined variables include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>$CI_COMMIT_SHA</code>: The commit SHA of the current pipeline.</li>\n<li><code>$CI_PROJECT_DIR</code>: The directory where the project is cloned.</li>\n<li><code>$CI_PIPELINE_ID</code>: The ID of the current pipeline.</li>\n<li><code>$CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME</code>: The name of the environment being deployed to (if applicable).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Best practices</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Securely manage sensitive variables: Use protected and masked variables for API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information.</li>\n<li>Avoid hardcoding values: Use variables to store configuration values, making your pipelines more flexible and maintainable.</li>\n<li>Organize your variables: Use descriptive names and group related variables together for better organization.</li>\n<li>Use the appropriate scope: Choose the correct scope (project, group, or instance) for your variables based on their intended use and visibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unlock the power of variables</h3>\n<p>CI/CD variables are a powerful tool for customizing and securing your GitLab pipelines. By mastering variables and understanding their different scopes, you can create more flexible, maintainable, and efficient workflows.</p>\n<p>We hope you found it helpful and are now well-equipped to leverage the power of GitLab for your development projects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get started with CI/CD variables today with a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">free, 60-day trial of GitLab Ultimate with Duo Enterprise</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>&quot;Getting Started with GitLab&quot; series</h2>\n<p>Read more articles in our &quot;Getting Started with GitLab&quot; series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/14/getting-started-with-gitlab-how-to-manage-users/\">How to manage users</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/28/getting-started-with-gitlab-how-to-import-your-projects-to-gitlab/\">How to import your projects to GitLab</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/02/11/getting-started-with-gitlab-mastering-project-management/\">Mastering project management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/03/13/automating-agile-workflows-with-the-gitlab-triage-gem/\">Automating Agile workflows with the gitlab-triage gem</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/25/getting-started-with-gitlab-understanding-ci-cd/\">Understanding CI/CD</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>TypeScript adoption continues to grow, with over 88% of developers reporting they either use or want to use it. Yet, migrating existing JavaScript codebases to TypeScript is often a time-consuming process. Enter <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/02/24/gitlab-duo-workflow-enterprise-visibility-and-control-for-agentic-ai/\">GitLab Duo Workflow</a>: secure, agentic AI that sits right inside your development environment, helping transform high-level tasks into executable workflows. In this article, you'll learn how we used Duo Workflow to update Duo Workflow, converting a real-world JavaScript application to TypeScript. We'll also review the technical process and broader implications for development workflows.</p>\n<p>This video walks through visually what you'll read below:</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1085078036?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Refactor JavaScript to TypeScript with GitLab Duo Workflow&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>The challenge: Refactor JS to TS</h2>\n<p>We decided to migrate Duo Workflow client-related logic to TypeScript for better type safety and auto-complete. A JavaScript-to-TypeScript migration involves more than just changing file extensions. It requires:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Analyzing existing code patterns to determine appropriate types</li>\n<li>Handling edge cases where type inference is ambiguous</li>\n<li>Ensuring consistency across the codebase</li>\n<li>Managing dependencies and third-party libraries</li>\n<li>Validating that runtime behavior remains unchanged</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Doing all of this work manually can be very time consuming and not much fun. Thankfully, managing your projects is easier and more efficient with Duo Workflow – even when the project is Duo Workflow.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>If you've used AI coding assistants before, you're likely familiar with their chat-based interfaces (like <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/04/18/gitlab-duo-chat-now-generally-available/\">GitLab Duo Chat</a>). These chats can provide code snippets, suggested directory structures, and more. GitLab Duo Workflow fundamentally differs from these in several key ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's contextually aware of your entire codebase, not just open files or highlighted text. You can also add context from relevant GitLab issues or merge requests.</li>\n<li>It develops and executes a multi-stage plan, allowing for more complete solutions.</li>\n<li>It keeps a human in the loop, ensuring you understand and approve of what is happening at each step of the way.</li>\n<li>It stages changes to your repository, giving you control over what to accept.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Duo Workflow uses an agentic AI approach, powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to understand code semantics while maintaining a deep integration with GitLab's DevOps platform.</p>\n<p>Let's walk through a real-world example of refactoring a JavaScript file using GitLab Duo Workflow. In our case, we started with the prompt:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-unset\">I need to refactor a JavaScript file packages/webview_duo_workflow/src/app/stores/workflow.js to TypeScript. Please analyze the code, identify any issues, and convert it to TypeScript with appropriate type definitions.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\n<p>After prompting, Duo Workflow first analyzed the codebase structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identified that <code>workflow.js</code> is a Pinia store implementation</li>\n<li>Noted it uses imports from various modules including <code>constants.ts</code> (which was already in TypeScript)</li>\n<li>Recognized GraphQL queries import exists but the file wasn't accessible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on this analysis, Duo Workflow identified specific typing needs:</p>\n<p><strong>Type definitions needed for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store State interface with precise types:\n<ul>\n<li><code>areWorkflowsLoading</code>: boolean</li>\n<li><code>isLoadingWorkflow</code>: boolean</li>\n<li><code>isLoadingRecentWorkflows</code>: boolean</li>\n<li><code>recentWorkflows</code>: array</li>\n<li><code>workflows</code>: array</li>\n<li><code>workflowsPageInfo</code>: object</li>\n<li><code>initialState</code>: object</li>\n<li><code>activeWorkflow</code>: object with specific shape</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Interface definitions required:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workflow interface with properties:\n<ul>\n<li><code>id</code>: string</li>\n<li><code>goal</code>: string</li>\n<li><code>status</code>: string</li>\n<li><code>checkpoint</code>: object</li>\n<li><code>type</code>: string</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Parameter types needed for:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GraphQL response types for workflows data</li>\n<li>Event handler parameter types</li>\n<li>Function parameter types for actions like <code>getWorkflowById</code>, <code>runWorkflow</code>, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Duo Workflow identified several complex patterns requiring special handling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses optional chaining extensively</li>\n<li>Has nested object destructuring</li>\n<li>Contains GraphQL integration</li>\n<li>Uses Pinia store patterns with state, getters, and actions</li>\n<li>Implements an events mapping system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The system recognized external type dependencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pinia store types</li>\n<li>GraphQL query response types</li>\n<li>Functions from an internal Bridge module were also properly recognized (for <code>sendRequest</code>, <code>sendGraphqlRequest</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final analysis concluded: &quot;The file will need to be renamed from .js to .ts and appropriate type definitions added while maintaining the existing functionality.&quot;</p>\n<h3>Planning</h3>\n<p>Based on this thorough analysis, Duo Workflow created a structured plan consisting of specific tasks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create a new TypeScript file</strong> <code>workflow.ts</code> in the same directory as the original JS file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create TypeScript interfaces</strong> for the store state and workflow types at the top of the new file, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WorkflowState interface for store state</li>\n<li>Workflow interface for workflow object structure</li>\n<li>WorkflowPageInfo interface for pagination info</li>\n<li>WorkflowCheckpoint interface for checkpoint data</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Copy and add type annotations</strong> to the store implementation from <code>workflow.js</code>, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>State return type</li>\n<li>Getter return types</li>\n<li>Action parameter types</li>\n<li>Action return types</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Update all imports</strong> in <code>workflow.ts</code> to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add type imports from Pinia</li>\n<li>Update local imports to use .ts extensions where applicable</li>\n<li>Import any required type definitions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Execution</h3>\n<p>After the plan is complete, we were prompted to  “Approve plan.” Before clicking approve, we reviewed each step and ensured we were comfortable with the plan. After approval, Duo Workflow showed its progress through each step with visual indicators and explanations of what API operations were supporting each task (like &quot;Supported by: create_file_with_contents&quot; or &quot;Supported by: edit_file&quot;). When the work was done, we reviewed the changes before committing.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This JavaScript-to-TypeScript migration example showcases a significant evolution in AI-assisted development. What makes GitLab Duo Workflow particularly interesting is its approach to:</p>\n<h3>Task-oriented programming vs. suggestion-only assistance</h3>\n<p>Unlike many AI assistants that simply offer code snippets or suggestions, Duo Workflow understands and executes complete tasks. The difference is significant — rather than saying &quot;here's some TypeScript code you might use,&quot; it says &quot;I'll convert this file for you, here's my plan, and here are the changes I'm making.&quot;</p>\n<h3>Contextual understanding of the entire codebase</h3>\n<p>The tool demonstrates awareness of project structure, related files (like constants.ts and GraphQL queries), and the relationships between components. This contextual understanding allows for more sophisticated conversions than localized transformations.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step execution with visibility</h3>\n<p>The plan-based approach, with clear steps and progress indicators, provides transparency into what would otherwise be a black-box process. This allows developers to understand what the AI is doing and how it's approaching the problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GitLab Duo Workflow is currently available in private beta for GitLab Ultimate customers. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/workflow/\">Sign up for the waitlist today!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/05/07/agentic-ai-guides-and-resources/\">Agentic AI guides and resources</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/02/24/gitlab-duo-workflow-enterprise-visibility-and-control-for-agentic-ai/\">GitLab Duo Workflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/agentic-ai/\">What is agentic AI?</a></li>\n</ul>",

Often, these breaches result in the exposure of credentials – usernames, emails, and passwords – in plain text, either directly or with insufficient protection against conversion to plain text. These compromised or stolen credentials are actively and widely leveraged by attackers, too. <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf\">Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report</a> identified use of stolen credentials as the initial action in 24% of breaches, ranking it as their top initial action.</p>\n<p>GitLab.com stores your password securely, salted and hashed with bcrypt. Your password goes through a one-way hashing transformation before storage, securing your password and ensuring it is not possible to extract the original password from storage. The representation is also unique: Even if two users shared the same password, the results of the one-way transformations would be completely different. However, these safeguards intentionally make it impractical to identify all users with a compromised or otherwise weak password.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting on June 19, 2025, GitLab will be introduce compromised password detection during sign-in for all GitLab.com users.</strong> This works by securely comparing the password you log in with against a database of known compromised credentials during authentication. If the password is correct but matches known compromised credentials, you will be alerted with a banner on GitLab.com and you will be sent an email notification until you change your password.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Compromised password detection is only for logins using GitLab’s native username and password and does not apply to credentials used through SSO.</em></p>\n<p>Example compromised password warning banner:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Example Compromised Password Warning Banner\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4PR8J4tioSao5oL8vZk2Mi/49fa59ee86c1210b9e5b0e586b09a22d/image1.png\" /></p>\n<p>We’re excited to introduce this additional countermeasure to help ensure your account is secure.

      "published": "2025-05-19T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>We're excited to announce that GitLab Dedicated for Government has achieved FedRAMP Authorization at the Moderate Impact Level, marking a significant milestone in our commitment to serving public sector organizations. GitLab Dedicated for Government is now listed as &quot;Authorized&quot; on the <a href=\"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2411959145\">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>. Our single-tenant solution provides all the benefits of an enterprise DevSecOps platform with enhanced data residency, isolation, and private networking capabilities to meet the most stringent compliance requirements. GitLab Dedicated for Government provides the flexibility and scalability of a SaaS solution, enabling government agencies to modernize and secure their software supply chain from code to cloud.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/\">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</a> (FedRAMP) is the gold standard for cloud security across US government agencies. As a mandatory security framework for federal cloud adoption since its 2011 launch, it provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the growing demand for secure cloud solutions</h2>\n<p>As more public sector organizations move away from costly legacy systems and migrate their mission-critical workloads to the cloud, cloud-native development and multi-cloud adoption will grow significantly. At GitLab, we serve a wide variety of customers in the public sector – from federally-funded research and development centers, service providers, and contractors working on behalf of the government, to the largest government agencies across the globe. We understand that no single deployment model will serve the needs of all of our customers.</p>\n<p>Our customers have told us they need a SaaS offering that provides additional deployment control and data residency to meet stringent compliance requirements. We see this need with large enterprises and companies in regulated industries that are coming under increased scrutiny, facing global internet policy fragmentation, and dealing with the expanding complexity of data governance. GitLab has consistently observed that security is a top priority for organizations and our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/\">2024 Global DevSecOps Survey</a> showed that this trend continued, with security remaining the primary investment area.</p>\n<p>GitLab Dedicated for Government was specifically designed to address these needs – enabling organizations to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives with confidence.</p>\n<h2>Key benefits of GitLab Dedicated for Government</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Toolchain consolidation</strong></p>\n<p>Toolchain management continues to be a significant challenge for DevSecOps teams. According to our 2024 Global DevSecOps Survey, 64% of respondents expressed the need to consolidate their toolchains, with security professionals particularly affected – 63% reported using six or more tools.</p>\n<p>This proliferation of tools results in unnecessary expenditure and introduces complexities and vulnerabilities that increase the risk of cyber attacks. GitLab Dedicated for Government unites DevSecOps teams on a single platform with a unified workflow, eliminating the need to purchase or maintain multiple tools. Organizations can strengthen security, improve efficiency, and accelerate collaboration by consolidating their complex toolchains. Additionally, consolidation supports zero trust architecture implementation by centralizing access control, making it easier to enforce consistent security policies and authentication requirements across the entire development lifecycle. GitLab also enables flexibility by allowing you to utilize existing critical tools through our integration capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Data residency and protection</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab Dedicated for Government is built on FedRAMP-authorized infrastructure that meets U.S. data sovereignty requirements, including access restricted to U.S. citizens. To further enhance data protection, our solution supports secure, private connections between the customer's virtual private cloud network and GitLab, ensuring users, data, and services have secure access to isolated instances without direct internet exposure. All data is <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#data-encryption\">encrypted at rest</a> and in transit using the latest encryption standards, with the option to use your own AWS Key Management Service encryption key for data at rest, giving you full control over stored data. GitLab Dedicated for Government also ensures CVEs are patched continuously. It is an ideal platform for teams to build a centralized DevSecOps platform while offboarding compliance burdens to GitLab.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Managed and hosted by GitLab</strong></p>\n<p>Our solution is single-tenant (providing physical isolation from other customers), U.S.-based, privately connected, and fully managed and hosted by GitLab. Organizations can quickly realize the value of a comprehensive DevSecOps platform with the advanced flexibility and customization of a self-managed instance – without requiring staff to build and manage infrastructure.</p>\n<p>This approach delivers all the benefits of GitLab – shorter cycle times, lower costs, stronger security, and more productive developers – with a lower total cost of ownership and quicker time-to-value compared to self-hosting.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Comprehensive native security capabilities</strong></p>\n<p>Our 2024 Global DevSecOps Survey revealed that 60% of public sector security professionals report vulnerabilities are mostly discovered after code is merged into test environments, and only 51% consider their DevSecOps practices mature and well-ingrained. GitLab's comprehensive security scanning capabilities, built into the DevSecOps platform,  provide superior control and protection throughout the entire software development lifecycle, helping public sector organizations address these issues. These features eliminate the need for third-party security tools that could potentially compromise compliance.</p>\n<p>For example, organizations gain access to a complete suite of native security scanners including API Security, Container Scanning, Dynamic Application Security Testing, and Fuzz Testing. This integrated approach ensures federal security standards are met without disrupting development workflows.</p>\n<p>With the GitLab DevSecOps unified platform, public sector organizations avoid the painful scenario of discovering security limitations mid-implementation and having to choose between compromising on security features or implementing non-compliant solutions.</p>\n<h2>How to get started with GitLab Dedicated for Government</h2>\n<p>GitLab Dedicated for Government provides the efficiencies of the cloud combined with infrastructure-level isolation and data residency controls.

The launch of ChatGPT was a seminal moment in the evolution of AI, and since then, AI’s adoption has accelerated. According to “<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32966/w32966.pdf\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The rapid adoption of Generative AI.

So where is AI headed?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, let us start by looking at how other transformational technologies have evolved throughout history. Take the Internet for example – it started with the infrastructure - with routers and network switches. But the true inflection point came with the emergence of platform capabilities, such as web browsers and HTML, which allowed people to build and use applications like search engines, e-commerce, and social media.</p>\n<p>If you look at the PC, microprocessors and memory and other infrastructure components came first. But what triggered the massive adoption was the creation of a platform – WinTel, which provided a standardized environment for developing and running PC applications. Same with the smartphones; the infrastructure started first with modems and cell towers, but it really took off when a platform enabled the creation and use of applications.</p>\n<p>AI will follow a similar <strong>IPA</strong> (<strong>I</strong>nfrastructure -&gt; <strong>P</strong>latform -&gt; <strong>A</strong>pplication) model, with the innovation moving from Infrastructure (e.g. GPU) to Platforms (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gen-ai\">DigitalOcean GenAI Platform</a>) and Applications (e.g. Copilots), and <strong>AI agents</strong> are going to accelerate this transformation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI evolution\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-evolution2.png\" /></p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-ai-agents\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-ai-agents\">What are AI agents?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-ai-agents\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>In essence, an <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/ai-agents\">AI agent </a>is a piece of software that can act like humans – take input, reason about things, and perform actions. Agents are really four sequences of primitives. The agent gets a command from the user to perform some action, the agent then gets the information it needs by acquiring data from the outside world, it then reasons and plans how to get the job done, and finally it performs the actions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"ai agents\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-understanding-agents.png\" /></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\">AI agents will transform businesses</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Agents will drive a massive automation of work.Consider the example of a customer service agent today. Many of the calls that such an agent handles can be handled by an AI agent. An average call interaction handled by a human agent that takes about 10 minutes today costs around $3^, while an AI agent can do that for one cent^^. Not just that,  the quality of these AI models is improving exponentially and the cost of AI is decreasing by 10X YoY. So as you factor in the progress over the next few years, the conclusion is inevitable - agents will be automating or assisting with a lot of the “human work”. That means, businesses of all kinds will have no option but to reinvent themselves with AI agents in order to serve their customers in the best and most cost effective way possible.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, annual US salaries total approximately $200 billion for HR, $330 billion for IT, and $1.1 trillion for sales &amp; marketing, and as a lot of enterprise workflows get automated, the cloud and AI TAM will increase by hundreds of billions of dollars as businesses deploy agents to automate enterprise work.</p>\n<p>At DigitalOcean, we will fully participate in this TAM expansion by enabling customers to build and deploy agents through our GenAI platform.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"agentic AI TAM\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-cloud-growth.png\" /></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\">Agentic Cloud - AI agents transforming the cloud</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Given that agents will touch every enterprise workflow, it is fair to ask “how will agents change the cloud”? Indeed, we are at an inflection point for the cloud due to two emerging paradigm shifts: 1) Natural language as code, and 2) agents automating human work. The first will change how developers interact with the cloud, while the second will automate many DevOps/CloudOps and other cloud workflows. Like in previous transformations, there will be winners and losers. The winners will be the ones who use the new paradigms to reinvent themselves, while the losers will be the ones who do not change.</p>\n<p>At DigitalOcean, we will be at the forefront of reinventing the cloud by embedding agentic automation into our services. Let me illustrate how we are applying the Agentic cloud paradigm to reimagine web hosting. <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudways</a> is a web hosting software from DigitalOcean that is available on multiple clouds - DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP, Vultr, and Linode, Cloudways was recently ranked as the No. 1  web hosting software by CNET, and is one of the most popular web hosting applications for WordPress, which powers more than 40% of websites.</p>\n<p>Customers tell us that dealing with system issues (disk usage, DDOS, etc.) is a significant pain point in web hosting and they often spend several hours a month debugging and fixing such issues. Today, DigitalOcean receives more than 600,000 customer support requests a year for hosting system issues, with each of these support requests spanning 40 minutes on average. Therefore, we asked the question - “How would Cloudways have dealt with system issues if AI and agents were available when it was first built”? The answer was pretty obvious – Cloudways would use agents to autonomously rootcause and fix these issues, and enable customers to interact in natural language to gain insight about these issues. So, we set out to do exactly that by embedding SRE (system reliability) agents inside Cloudways that can take input from users in English and autonomously debug and fix system issues.</p>\n<p>We launched <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/cloudways-ai-copilot.php\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudways AI agent</a> – one of the most sophisticated uses of GenAI in the industry - in private preview with about 250 customers in Q1 ‘25. As shown in the video below, Cloudways AI agent provides troubleshooting insights and 1-click automated issue resolution. The user only needs to click the alert when issues arise and the AI agent instantly explains the issues and provides remediation steps. And with a single click, AI jumps into action and fixes the issues automatically. Users no longer need to muck around with code, and all the interactions are done in natural language. What used to take an hour now just takes a minute, saving businesses thousands of dollars a year^^^.</p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW2298unVLs\" target=\"_blank\">View YouTube video</a>\n\n<p>We will be releasing the General Availability (GA) very soon and are encouraged by the incredible feedback from early customers - “Cloudways Copilot has been a game-changer”; “It is the first good implementation of AI I’ve seen”; “It has saved us countless hours”; “It is incredibly fast, accurate, and intuitive; “ The insights it provides are spot on and the recommended steps have been 100% correct every time.”</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cloudways AI quotes\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-AI-agent-blog-quotes.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is only the beginning. We are going to embed AI agents in all of our services, providing customers a truly differentiated cloud experience. As an agentic cloud, DigitalOcean - the simplest, scalable and approachable cloud – gets even simpler, more scalable and approachable. We believe we are uniquely positioned to lead the next wave in reimagining the cloud and I will discuss more in a future blog.</p>\n<p>^ Based on U.S. average customer service salary of $20/hr for a 10-minute call.</p>\n<p>^^ Based on agent pricing of $1 per million tokens.</p>\n<p>^^^ Based on average customer spend of $200 per month on these tasks.</p>\n</details>",

Here are a few reasons we recommend examining your cloud setup regularly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>They support business growth: As your business evolves, your cloud infrastructure must evolve with it. A cloud architecture review helps you align your current environment with your business goals, helping to ensure your cloud is positioned to support where you are today, where you’re heading, and the outcomes you need to achieve.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They improve performance and security: Regular reviews can find hidden problems that can slow you down or make you less secure. Downtime isn’t just inconvenient, it’s costly. A strong, resilient cloud architecture helps you avoid downtime and keeps your business running smoothly, no matter what comes your way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They help you save on costs: Cloud reviews can help you make sure your setup is running as cost-efficiently as possible and that you’re getting your money’s worth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\">Tips to boost cloud performance and security</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Optimizing cloud performance and security is about delivering faster user experiences, protecting sensitive data, and avoiding waste. Whether you’re scaling your app or managing costs, a well-tuned cloud setup gives you speed, stability, and peace of mind. Here are five things you can check to make your cloud faster, more reliable and better protected:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Audit your virtual machines and Kubernetes nodes: Many businesses use more virtual machines or Kubernetes nodes than they need. This wastes money. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-droplet-vm\">Choose the right  virtual machines</a> and Kubernetes node pools to make sure they match how much you’re using. If you find machines that aren’t being used much, make them smaller or move workloads to a smaller instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use load balancers and autoscaling: Traffic to your business can change quickly. If you have too much infrastructure, you waste money. If you have too little, your app will run poorly. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/autoscale-workloads-using-droplet-autoscale-pools\">Autoscaling</a> adjusts your infrastructure based on traffic. This way, you don’t pay for resources you don’t need, and your app runs well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Streamline networking with VPCs: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/vpc-vs-vpn\">Virtual private clouds</a> (VPCs) can make internal communication faster and cheaper. VPCs also improve security by keeping your traffic away from the public internet. Set up VPCs for internal services that talk to each other a lot. This reduces delay and helps protect your internal resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monitor usage and set up alerts: Even with a good setup, problems will happen. Alerts can warn you before small issues become big headaches. Use alerts to track things like CPU usage, memory usage, and data transfers. You can also set up alerts for billing to warn you about unexpected costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Back up smarter: Losing data or taking a long time to recover can hurt your business. Have a good backup plan. Back up your databases and file systems regularly. Automate the backup process and test your restores to make sure they work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\">Tips to save money and grow efficiently</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Here are five more things you can do to save money and grow your business:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/data-storage-management-strategies\">Consolidate and optimize storage</a>: Unused storage costs money. Check your storage usage regularly to avoid waste. Delete old snapshots and unused disks to free up resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/managed-vs-self-managed-databases\">Use managed services</a>: Running your own databases can take time and introduce errors. Managed services can handle scaling, security, and uptime for you, helping to save you time and money. Migrate any self-hosted databases to managed databases offered by your cloud provider—we recommend DigitalOcean. ;)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automate deployments: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/streamline-deployment-through-ci-cd-on-digitalocean-s-app-platform\">Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</a> (CI/CD) can reduce errors and simplify rollbacks. Infrastructure as code makes your environment easy to reproduce and build on. Use tools like Terraform and GitHub actions to automate your infrastructure and deployments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review data costs: Egress data costs can add up, especially if you use a lot of media or APIs. Find ways to reduce unnecessary outbound traffic. Use <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/what-is-a-cdn\">CDNs</a> to cache content closer to where your users are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do a monthly cost vs. performance review: Make time each month to review your <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/understand-your-cloud-bill\">cloud bill</a> and performance metrics to help you make sure you’re spending money where it matters most. Track your spending and performance to make informed decisions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\">How DigitalOcean experts help: A real-world example</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Similar to many DigitalOcean customers, a mid-sized software company wanted to serve customers globally with low delay and high performance.

Here’s their optimized cloud architecture following our review discussions:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cloud architecture example\" src=\"https://sailtosuccess.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Cloud%20architecture%20example.png\" /><figcaption>Cloud architecture example</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To meet the company’s particular needs, DigitalOcean cloud infrastructure experts suggested the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/load-balancers\">Global load balancer</a>: Directs traffic to the closest available region. Regional Internal Load Balancers distribute traffic within each region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes\">Managed Kubernetes</a>: Provides a fully managed control plane with autoscaling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-mysql\">Managed Database</a>: Offers a primary and standby node for high availability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/container-registry\">Container registry</a>: Stores Docker images for automated pipelines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/vpc\">VPC peering</a>: Secures connections between the app and database.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By following these suggestions, the customer created a more reliable, secure, and cost-effective cloud setup. They were able to create an architecture diagram that helped visualize their infrastructure and share it with their team to build a common understanding. Like a captain charting a course, they used this clarity to make informed changes, optimizing their setup to catch the winds of today’s business demands and stay steady on course for future growth.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"optimize-your-cloud-to-empower-your-business\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimize-your-cloud-to-empower-your-business\">Optimize your cloud to empower your business</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimize-your-cloud-to-empower-your-business\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>To successfully journey across the ocean of challenges awaiting your business, you need a cloud setup that helps and doesn’t hurt.

Without a structured approach, organizations risk unauthorized access, operational inefficiencies, and compliance gaps. With RBAC now applicable to your MongoDB environment, you can enforce clear, predefined access policies—helping to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable database management. Here’s how RBAC can benefit your business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced security:</strong> RBAC protects against unauthorized access by only allowing verified users to interact with sensitive database resources. This reduces the risk of data breaches and strengthens overall security posture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational efficiency:</strong> With predefined roles, administrators can streamline user provisioning and de-provisioning, minimizing the manual workload and reducing errors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved compliance:</strong> RBAC helps organizations meet industry standards and regulatory requirements by enforcing structured access controls, making audits and reporting more straightforward.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cost savings:</strong> By automating user access management, RBAC reduces administrative overhead and lowers the risk of security breaches, which can be costly to remediate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible role adaptability:</strong> As organizations evolve, RBAC allows for quick adjustments to permissions and roles, ensuring that access controls align with changing business needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simplified administration:</strong> Instead of managing individual user permissions, administrators can assign roles at scale, reducing complexity and improving governance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"best-practices-for-implementing-predefined-roles-rbac-in-your-organization\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#best-practices-for-implementing-predefined-roles-rbac-in-your-organization\">Best practices for implementing predefined roles/RBAC in your organization</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#best-practices-for-implementing-predefined-roles-rbac-in-your-organization\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>In case you are new to the concept of RBAC or predefined roles, here are some best practices to maximize the benefits you see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Conduct a role analysis</strong>: Define roles based on job functions to ensure appropriate access control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Follow the principle of least privilege</strong>: Grant only the minimum access necessary to reduce security risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Regularly review and update roles</strong>: Conduct periodic audits to keep permissions aligned with business needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide user training</strong>: Educate employees on RBAC policies to ensure proper adherence and minimize misuse.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"get-started\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started\">Get Started</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started\"></a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/#latest-updates\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Explore our product documentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://waves.digitalocean.com/MTEzLURUTi0yNjYAAAGRLj8HYzSI0GicIqKVzra2UWvbUfm3Dsw701LuWBXnNRj4AVpZ-ER1wEZVLKJgMhHWcxxxy4A=\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Contact our sales team or connect with a DigitalOcean partner who can help advise you on migration, architecture reviews, deployment, and other infrastructure inquiries</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/product-tours/managed-databases\">Take a self-guided MongoDB product tour</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Start building with DigitalOcean today by signing up for a cloud account</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>",

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>.

We see opportunities for better performance and ease of use by only deprecating those configurations, setting smarter defaults and encouraging more best practices.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 sets the stage for us to bring the next generation of features along with performance and scalability improvements the community hungers for.</p><p>This release will improve UX, security and performance by:</p><ol><li>Introducing additional recommended configurations out of the box, thus reducing required effort to achieve more secure and performant Argo CD configurations</li><li>Dropping support for legacy configuration options, that we discourage using</li></ol><p>With time and community feedback, we realized that certain <em>optional</em> configurations should in fact be the <em>default</em>, since many users explicitly configure those. One such example would be some performance-related configurations.</p><p>This release will also address long-existing technical debt, caused by supporting legacy configurations we started with when Argo CD was young, and which we no longer recommend on using, as Argo CD had matured.</p><h3><strong>What Is Changing in This Version?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/milestone/27?closed=1\">Here</a> is a non-exhaustive list of changes in this release, among those:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19768\">Removal</a> of support for legacy argocd-cm repository config</li><li>Enabling fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19988\">by default</a></li><li>Making applyNestedSelectors: true the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/14152\">default and only</a> option for matrix/merge generators</li><li>Having an <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">opinion</a> on secrets — while we remained un-opinionated regarding secret management with Argo CD since day 1, maintainability and security lessons learned surfaced the need to be better aligned with the industry in this domain</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21207\">Preventing</a> the usage of in-cluster, when in-cluster is explicitly disabled</li></ol><h3>Backwards Compatibility &amp; Migration</h3><p>We aim for v3 release to be so inoffensive, that upgrading to 3.0 is almost as easy as upgrading between 2.x minor versions has been.</p><p>For each change, the documentation will contain clear description of:</p><ol><li>What the change is</li><li>How to determine whether the user is affected by the change (i.e which command to run)</li><li>How to migrate</li><li>For relatively high-risk changes - how to opt out (i.e switch back to the old default)</li></ol><h3>Get Involved</h3><p>You can read the full proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21422\">here</a>.

With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates.

We have explained how plugins work in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-rollouts-1-5-release-candidate-2bd93720e411\">the release announcement</a>.</p><p>The second one is the new Kubernetes Gateway API.</p><h3>The Gateway API — a unified standard for service meshes and ingresses in Kubernetes</h3><p>The Gateway API is a Kubernetes SIG project that unifies all networking solutions of Kubernetes under a common umbrella adding several features missing from the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">basic Ingress API</a> while at the same time incorporating all the service mesh solutions.</p><p>You can think of the gateway API as the next generation of the Kubernetes Ingress API, as well as the next generation of the (<a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/10/03/cncf-archives-the-service-mesh-interface-smi-project/\">now retired</a>) <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/projects/service-mesh-interface-smi/\">SMI standard</a>.</p><p>The Kubernetes Gateway API is notable because it now defines a clear separation between people defining the infrastructure vs people using the infrastructure.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l6pMy712SHGuNkDgl2tFtA.png\" /><figcaption>Gateway API resource model</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, it has the unanimous support of all major networking vendors. Most networking solutions have either added initial support for the Gateway API, or declared that they will follow it.</p><p>You can see the extensive list of supporters of the API at the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementation list</a>.</p><h3>Argo Rollouts and the Gateway API — like jelly and peanut butter</h3><p>Argo Rollouts has now a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/rollouts-plugin-trafficrouter-gatewayapi\">plugin for supporting the Gateway API</a>. We started with early development targeting the 0.x versions of the Kubernetes Gateway API and an <a href=\"https://rollouts-plugin-trafficrouter-gatewayapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/provider-status/\">expanding list of tested implementations</a>.</p><p>This means that you can use Argo Rollouts for canary deployments with any present and future implementations of the Kubernetes Gateway API WITHOUT any code changes.

This feature allows you to group information from multiple places (for example a public Helm chart plus your local values file) to form a single Argo CD application. Initial support for defining multiple sources was already added in Argo CD version 2.6, and the support for CLI was added in 2.11. The UI still assumed the application to have a single source and certain CLI features like rollback were not yet supported for an application with multiple sources.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, rollback of a multiple source application is now possible via both Argo CD UI and CLI.</p><p>In addition to the rollback feature, a new Sources tab has been added to the Application Details page, enabling users to manage (view and edit) the sources of an application.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mj0F_f8U8TQMhzvN\" /></figure><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/keithchong\">Keith Chong</a> (Red Hat) and <a href=\"https://github.com/JorTurFer\">Jorge Turrado</a> for implementing these features.</p><h3>Project Scoped Repository Credential Improvements</h3><p>Currently, multiple repository credentials sharing the same URL is not allowed by the Argo CD API. If the credentials are added directly to the argocd namespace, argocd-server won’t return an error, but this still does not work since the first secret that matches a repository URL is the one that gets returned, and the order is also undefined.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, Argo CD will allow multiple app projects to have the ability to have separate repository credentials having the same URL.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">Blake Pettersson</a> (Akuity) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Add labels for Kubernetes events</h3><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, users will be able to expose application labels on k8s events generated by Argo CD. When the events are created for Applications that have specific label keys defined in `resource.includeEventLabelKeys`, the controller will attach the matching labels to the events. This connection will make it simpler to filter or process the events based on the applications using these labels.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/svghadi\">Siddhesh Ghadi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Consistent Sharding Algorithm</h3><p>Argo CD provides the capability to employ sharding for different Argo CD application controllers. This allows you to assign specific clusters to specific controllers to distribute the load across the different shards.</p><p>The existing sharding algorithms, including the legacy method and the round-robin algorithm, have shown limitations in maintaining optimal load distribution and minimizing unnecessary cluster-to-shard assignment changes.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, a new sharding algorithm named “consistent-hashing” is introduced which reduces Cluster-to-Shard Assignment Changes and optimizes resource utilization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/akram\">Akram Ben Aissi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p>Here are some other new changes that made it into the release</p><ul><li>Updates to git client for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17566\">resolving semantic versioning tags</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/thepabloaguilar\">Pablo Aguilar</a> from Stone Payments)</li><li>Application Set Git Generator now supports <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18545\">GPG signature verification</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/ishitasequeira\">Ishita Sequeira</a> from Red Hat)</li><li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18250\">ls-remote request fail</a> metric (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>)</li><li>Add new<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/pull/560\"> annotation argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Force=true</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/kkk777-7\">Kota Kimura</a> from CyberAgent, Inc.)</li><li>Add support for setting a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17728\">grpc message size as an environment variable</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pavel Kostohrys</a> from Codefresh)</li><li>Display the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18116\">list of dependent resources</a> in the delete popup (by <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a> from Intuit)</li><li>Remove support for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/13203\">old tracking label</a> <em>applications.argoproj.io/app-name</em> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">Soumya Ghosh Dastidar</a> from Akuity)</li><li>Add support for<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18484\"> fish shell completion</a> to Argo CD CLI (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Sn0rt\">Sn0rt</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18657\">Skip calling git fetch</a> if the commit to checkout exists locally (by <a href=\"https://github.com/shady-canva\">Shady Rafehi</a>)</li></ul><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.12.0-rc1\">release notes</a>, and <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.11-2.12/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

Please note that <em><code>EnvoyFilter</code> is not currently supported for any existing Istio version with waypoint proxies</em>. While it may be possible to use <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with waypoints in limited scenarios, its use is not supported, and is actively discouraged by the maintainers. The alpha API may break in future releases as it evolves. We expect official support will be provided at a later date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"customization-of-resources-provisioned-by-the-gateway-api\">Customization of resources provisioned by the Gateway API</h3>\n<p>When you create a Gateway or a waypoint using the Gateway API, a <code>Service</code> and a <code>Deployment</code> are created automatically. It has been a common request to allow customization of these objects, and that is now supported in Istio 1.26 by specifying a <code>ConfigMap</code> of parameters. If configuration for a <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code> or <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code> is provided, those resources will automatically be created also. <a href=\"/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Learn more about customizing the generated Gateway API resources.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"new-gateway-api-support\">New Gateway API support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/\"><code>TCPRoute</code></a> is now available in waypoints, allowing TCP traffic shifting in ambient mode.</p>\n<p>We also added support for the experimental <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtlspolicy/\"><code>BackendTLSPolicy</code></a> and started the implementation of <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtrafficpolicy/\"><code>BackendTrafficPolicy</code></a> in Gateway API 1.3, which will eventually set retry constraints.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-the-new-kubernetes-clustertrustbundle\">Support for the new Kubernetes <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code></h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve added experimental support for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#cluster-trust-bundles\">the experimental <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> resource in Kubernetes</a>, allowing support for the new method of bundling a certificate and its root of trust into a single object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plus-much-much-more\">Plus much, much more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>istioctl analyze</code> can now run specific checks!</li>\n<li>The CNI node agent no longer runs in the <code>hostNetwork</code> namespace by default, reducing the chance of port conflicts with other services running on a host!</li>\n<li>Required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources and <code>cniBinDir</code> values are set automatically when installing on GKE!</li>\n<li>An <code>EnvoyFilter</code> can now match a <code>VirtualHost</code> on a domain name!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read about these and more in the full <a href=\"/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/change-notes/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"catch-up-with-the-istio-project\">Catch up with the Istio project</h2>\n<p>If you only check in with us when we have a new release, you might have missed that <a href=\"/blog/2025/ztunnel-security-assessment/\">we published a security audit on ztunnel</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2025/ambient-performance/\">we compared performance of ambient mode throughput vs. running in-kernel</a>, or that <a href=\"/blog/2025/istio-at-kubecon-eu/\">we had a major presence at KubeCon EU</a>.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the CNI agent to no longer require <code>hostNetwork</code>, enhancing compatibility. Dynamic switching to the host network is now performed as needed. The previous behavior can be temporarily restored by setting the <code>ambient.shareHostNetworkNamespace</code> field in the <code>istio-cni</code> chart. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54726\">Issue #54726</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> iptables binary detection to validate baseline kernel support and to prefer <code>nft</code> when both legacy and <code>nft</code> are available but neither has existing rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the default value of maximum connections accepted per socket event to 1 to improve performance. To revert to the previous behavior, set <code>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SOCKET_EVENT_LOOP</code> to zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability for <code>EnvoyFilter</code> to match a <code>VirtualHost</code> by domain name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> initial support for the experimental Gateway API features <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> and <code>XBackendTrafficPolicy</code>. These are disabled by default and require setting <code>PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for referencing <code>ConfigMap</code>s, in addition to <code>Secret</code>s, for <code>DestinationRule</code> TLS in <code>SIMPLE</code> mode — useful when only a CA certificate is required.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> customization support for <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Gateway API automated deployments</a>. This applies to both Istio <code>Gateway</code> types (ingress and egress) and Istio Waypoint <code>Gateway</code> types (ambient waypoints). Users can now customize generated resources such as <code>Service</code>, <code>Deployment</code>, <code>ServiceAccount</code>, <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code>, and <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new environment variable <code>ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT</code> for <code>istiod</code>. When set to <code>false</code>, it disables automatic attachment of Gateway API resources to existing gateway deployments. By default, this is <code>true</code> to maintain the current behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure retry host predicates using the Retry API (<code>retry_ignore_previous_hosts</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying backoff intervals during retries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for using <code>TCPRoute</code> in waypoint proxies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured a <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where FQDNs did not work in a <code>WorkloadEntry</code> using ambient mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a case where <code>ReferenceGrants</code> did not function when mTLS was enabled on a Gateway listener.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55623\">Issue #55623</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio failed to correctly retrieve <code>allowedRoutes</code> for a sandboxed waypoint.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56010\">Issue #56010</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>ServiceEntry</code> endpoints were leaked when a pod was evicted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54997\">Issue #54997</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the listener address was duplicated for dual stack services with IPv6 priority.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56151\">Issue #56151</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added</strong> experimental support for the v1alpha1 <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> API. This can be enabled by setting <code>values.pilot.env.ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API=true</code>. Ensure the corresponding feature gates are enabled in your cluster; see <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3257-cluster-trust-bundles\">KEP-3257</a> for details.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43986\">Issue #43986</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>omit_empty_values</code> field in the <code>EnvoyFileAccessLog</code> provider via the Telemetry API.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54930\">Issue #54930</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> environment variable <code>PILOT_SPAWN_UPSTREAM_SPAN_FOR_GATEWAY</code>, which separates tracing spans for server and client gateways. This currently defaults to <code>false</code>, but will become the default in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a warning message for use of deprecated telemetry providers Lightstep and OpenCensus.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54002\">Issue #54002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the installation experience on GKE. When <code>global.platform=gke</code> is set, required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources are deployed automatically. When installing via <code>istioctl</code>, this setting is also auto-enabled if GKE is detected. Additionally, the <code>cniBinDir</code> is now configured appropriately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the <code>ztunnel</code> Helm chart to not assign resource names to <code>.Release.Name</code>, defaulting instead to <code>ztunnel</code>. This reverts a change introduced in Istio 1.25.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for setting the <code>reinvocationPolicy</code> in the revision-tag webhook when installing Istio via <code>istioctl</code> or Helm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure the service <code>loadBalancerClass</code> in the Gateway Helm chart.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39079\">Issue #39079</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a values <code>ConfigMap</code> that stores both the user-provided Helm values and the merged values after applying profiles for the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for reading header values from <code>istiod</code> environment variables.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53408\">Issue #53408</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a configurable <code>updateStrategy</code> for the <code>ztunnel</code> and <code>istio-cni</code> Helm charts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in the sidecar injection template that incorrectly removed existing init containers when both traffic interception and native sidecar were disabled.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54562\">Issue #54562</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> missing <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> labels on gateway pods when <code>--set networkGateway</code> is used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54909\">Issue #54909</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a problem where setting <code>replicaCount=0</code> in the <code>istio/gateway</code> Helm chart caused the <code>replicas</code> field to be omitted instead of explicitly set to <code>0</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55092\">Issue #55092</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue that caused file-based certificate references (e.g., from <code>DestinationRule</code> or <code>Gateway</code>) to fail when using SPIRE as the CA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> the deprecated <code>ENABLE_AUTO_SNI</code> flag and associated code paths.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--locality</code> parameter on <code>istioctl experimental workload group create</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54022\">Issue #54022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to run specific analyzer checks using the <code>istioctl analyze</code> command.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--tls-server-name</code> parameter to <code>istioctl create-remote-secret</code>, allowing the <code>tls-server-name</code> to be set in the generated kubeconfig. This ensures successful TLS connections when the <code>server</code> field is overridden with a gateway proxy hostname.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>envVarFrom</code> field in the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl analyze</code> reported an unknown annotation <code>sidecar.istio.io/statsCompression</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52082\">Issue #52082</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an error that blocked installation when <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> or <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> was omitted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>istioctl</code> ignored the <code>tag</code> fields under <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways</code> and <code>egressGateways</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl waypoint delete</code> could remove a non-waypoint Gateway resource when a name was specified.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55235\">Issue #55235</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl experimental describe</code> did not respect the <code>--namespace</code> flag.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55243\">Issue #55243</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug that prevented simultaneous generation of <code>istio.io/waypoint-for</code> and <code>istio.io/rev</code> labels when creating a waypoint proxy using <code>istioctl</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55437\">Issue #55437</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl admin log</code> could not modify the log level for <code>ingress status</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55741\">Issue #55741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a validation failure when <code>reconcileIptablesOnStartup: true</code> was set in the <code>istioctl</code> YAML configuration.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55347\">Issue #55347</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Score 6.5, Medium): Envoy crashes when HTTP <code>ext_proc</code> processes local replies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of Istio, this CVE is only exploitable in circumstances where

socket name\nvia <code>WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_SOCKET_FILE</code> did not work due to the Envoy bootstrap not being updated.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51979\">Issue #51979</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istiod fails with an LDS error for proxies &lt;1.23 when <code>meshConfig.accessLogEncoding</code> is set to <code>JSON</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55116\">Issue #55116</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>gateway</code> injection template did not respect the <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-logs-container</code>\nand <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container</code> annotations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where validation webhook would reject an otherwise valid <code>connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409\">Issue #55409</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) to now be affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
