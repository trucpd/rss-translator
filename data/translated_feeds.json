This time, we focus on\n<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#apps-special-interest-group\">SIG Apps</a></strong>,\nthe group responsible for everything related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on\nKubernetes. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandipanpanda\">Sandipan Panda</a>\n(<a href=\"https://www.devzero.io/\">DevZero</a>) had the opportunity to interview <a href=\"https://github.com/soltysh\">Maciej\nSzulik</a> (<a href=\"https://defenseunicorns.com/\">Defense Unicorns</a>) and <a href=\"https://github.com/janetkuo\">Janet\nKuo</a> (<a href=\"https://about.google/\">Google</a>), the chairs and tech leads of\nSIG Apps. They shared their experiences, challenges, and visions for the future of application\nmanagement within the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introductions\">Introductions</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: Hello, could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role, and your journey\nwithin the Kubernetes community that led to your current roles in SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: Hey, my name is Maciej, and I’m one of the leads for SIG Apps. Aside from this role, you\ncan also find me helping\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli#readme\">SIG CLI</a> and also being one of\nthe Steering Committee members. I’ve been contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various\nareas, including controllers, apiserver, and kubectl.</p>\n<p><strong>Janet</strong>: Certainly! I'm Janet, a Staff Software Engineer at Google, and I've been deeply involved\nwith the Kubernetes project since its early days, even before the 1.0 launch in 2015. It's been an\namazing journey!</p>\n<p>My current role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. My\njourney with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the Deployment API and adding\nrolling update functionalities. I naturally gravitated towards SIG Apps and became increasingly\ninvolved. Over time, I took on more responsibilities, culminating in my current leadership roles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-apps\">About SIG Apps</h2>\n<p><em>All following answers were jointly provided by Maciej and Janet.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: For those unfamiliar, could you provide an overview of SIG Apps' mission and objectives?\nWhat key problems does it aim to solve within the Kubernetes ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>As described in our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-apps/charter.md#scope\">charter</a>, we cover a\nbroad area related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes. That, in\nshort, means we’re open to each and everyone showing up at our bi-weekly meetings and discussing the\nups and downs of writing and deploying various applications on Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of the most significant projects or initiatives currently being undertaken\nby SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>At this point in time, the main factors driving the development of our controllers are the\nchallenges coming from running various AI-related workloads. It’s worth giving credit here to two\nworking groups we’ve sponsored over the past years:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-batch\">The Batch Working Group</a>, which is\nlooking at running HPC, AI/ML, and data analytics jobs on top of Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-serving\">The Serving Working Group</a>, which\nis focusing on hardware-accelerated AI/ML inference.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"best-practices-and-challenges\">Best practices and challenges</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: SIG Apps plays a crucial role in developing application management best practices for\nKubernetes. Can you share some of these best practices and how they help improve application\nlifecycle management?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Implementing <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">health checks and readiness probes</a>\nensures that your applications are healthy and ready to serve traffic, leading to improved\nreliability and uptime. The above, combined with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing\nsolutions, will provide insights into your application's behavior, enabling you to identify and\nresolve issues quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/\">Auto-scale your application</a> based\non resource utilization or custom metrics, optimizing resource usage and ensuring your\napplication can handle varying loads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use Deployment for stateless applications, StatefulSet for stateful applications, Job\nand CronJob for batch workloads, and DaemonSet for running a daemon on each node. Use\nOperators and CRDs to extend the Kubernetes API to automate the deployment, management, and\nlifecycle of complex applications, making them easier to operate and reducing manual\nintervention.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of the common challenges SIG Apps faces, and how do you address them?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest challenge we’re facing all the time is the need to reject a lot of features, ideas, and\nimprovements. This requires a lot of discipline and patience to be able to explain the reasons\nbehind those decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: How has the evolution of Kubernetes influenced the work of SIG Apps? Are there any\nrecent changes or upcoming features in Kubernetes that you find particularly relevant or beneficial\nfor SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>The main benefit for both us and the whole community around SIG Apps is the ability to extend\nkubernetes with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">Custom Resource Definitions</a>\nand the fact that users can build their own custom controllers leveraging the built-in ones to\nachieve whatever sophisticated use cases they might have and we, as the core maintainers, haven’t\nconsidered or weren’t able to efficiently resolve inside Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contributing-to-sig-apps\">Contributing to SIG Apps</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What opportunities are available for new contributors who want to get involved with SIG\nApps, and what advice would you give them?</strong></p>\n<p>We get the question, &quot;What good first issue might you recommend we start with?&quot; a lot :-) But\nunfortunately, there’s no easy answer to it. We always tell everyone that the best option to start\ncontributing to core controllers is to find one you are willing to spend some time with. Read\nthrough the code, then try running unit tests and integration tests focusing on that\ncontroller. Once you grasp the general idea, try breaking it and the tests again to verify your\nbreakage. Once you start feeling confident you understand that particular controller, you may want\nto search through open issues affecting that controller and either provide suggestions, explaining\nthe problem users have, or maybe attempt your first fix.</p>\n<p>Like we said, there are no shortcuts on that road; you need to spend the time with the codebase to\nunderstand all the edge cases we’ve slowly built up to get to the point where we are. Once you’re\nsuccessful with one controller, you’ll need to repeat that same process with others all over again.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: How does SIG Apps gather feedback from the community, and how is this feedback\nintegrated into your work?</strong></p>\n<p>We always encourage everyone to show up and present their problems and solutions during our\nbi-weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#meetings\">meetings</a>. As long\nas you’re solving an interesting problem on top of Kubernetes and you can provide valuable feedback\nabout any of the core controllers, we’re always happy to hear from everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: Looking ahead, what are the key focus areas or upcoming trends in application management\nwithin Kubernetes that SIG Apps is excited about? How is the SIG adapting to these trends?</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely the current AI hype is the major driving factor; as mentioned above, we have two working\ngroups, each covering a different aspect of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of your favorite things about this SIG?</strong></p>\n<p>Without a doubt, the people that participate in our meetings and on\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-apps\">Slack</a>, who tirelessly help triage issues, pull\nrequests and invest a lot of their time (very frequently their private time) into making kubernetes\ngreat!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>SIG Apps is an essential part of the Kubernetes community, helping to shape how applications are\ndeployed and managed at scale. From its work on improving Kubernetes' workload APIs to driving\ninnovation in AI/ML application management, SIG Apps is continually adapting to meet the needs of\nmodern application developers and operators. Whether you’re a new contributor or an experienced\ndeveloper, there’s always an opportunity to get involved and make an impact.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more or contributing to SIG Apps, be sure to check out their <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps\">SIG\nREADME</a> and join their bi-weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#meetings\">meetings</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/sig-apps\">SIG Apps Mailing List</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-apps\">SIG Apps on Slack</a></li>\n</ul>",

I work at Red Hat as a\nSpecialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the\nKubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project\nneeded help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that\n&quot;you come for the technology, and stay for the people&quot;: for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a\nwonderful journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Marek:</strong> Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring\na stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG\nInstrumentation</a>, where I\ncreated and led the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/\">Kubernetes Structured Logging effort</a>.<br />\nI'm still the main project lead for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/\">Kubernetes Metrics Server</a>,\nproviding crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,\nright around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most\nscalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's\nhistory. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia:</strong> Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd\nmaintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)\nand GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and\netcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my\njob, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more\nimportantly, the awesome open source community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-a-kubernetes-special-interest-group-sig\">Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG)</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is\na very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,\nserving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and\nreliability issues. <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2023/introducing-sig-etcd/\">Creating a dedicated SIG</a>\nallowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,\nand ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just\ndescribed being addressed, and to what extent?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and\ntransparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals</a>\nand PRRs (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">Production Readiness Reviews</a>,\nwhich has improved our feature development and release cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from\nbecoming a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like\n<a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a> and <a href=\"https://testgrid.k8s.io/\">TestGrid</a>. For large projects like\netcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear\ntools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also\nhelp etcd.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation\nfor addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes\necosystem.</p>\n<p>The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I’d like\nto highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd\ncontributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had\ngreater collaboration with other SIGs like <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Scalability</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Testing</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle\">SIG Cluster Lifecycle</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes\necosystem. The formation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-etcd-operator/README.md\">etcd Operator Working Group</a>\nunder the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful\ncollaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within\nKubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and\ncommunity involvement in recent months?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>James</strong>: Yes -- as showing in our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/23/prs-authors-repository-groups?orgId=1&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000\">unique PR author data</a>\nwe recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Unique PR author data stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Additionally, looking at our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-metric=contributions&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;var-country_name=All&amp;var-company_name=All&amp;var-company=all\">overall contributions across all etcd project repositories</a>\nwe are also observing a positive trend showing a resurgence in etcd project activity:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overall contributions stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The road ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current\npriorities for SIG etcd?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Reliability is always top of mind -– we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also\nworking on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making\netcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of\ncourse, scaling -– we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure\nnot only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve\nthe understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points\nthat the community cares about the most.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: SIG API Machinery, for sure – they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're\nconstantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle – etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,\nso we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG\nScalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the\nevolving cloud native landscape?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The\ncloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how\ncan they get involved?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md#meetings\">SIG etcd meetings</a>,\nfollow discussions on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev\">etcd-dev mailing list</a>, and check\nout our <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues\">GitHub issues</a>. We're always looking for people to\nreview proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: I love this question 😀 . There are numerous ways for people interested in contributing\nto SIG etcd to get involved and make a difference. Here are some key areas where you can help:</p>\n<p><strong>Code Contributions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Bug Fixes</em>: Tackle existing issues in the etcd codebase.

      "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000",
      "summary": "<p>A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature\nin Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of\n1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the\niptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent\nkernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even\nonce nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the <em>default</em>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-1-data-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latency</h2>\n<p>The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and\nhas problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large\nKubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.</p>\n<p>In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a\nnumber of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of\nServices and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top\nlevel of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service\nIP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code># If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain\n# KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O\n# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT\n# etc...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK\n</code></pre><p>This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel\nto check it against all of the Service rules is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number\nof Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and\nthe worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection\nincreases (with the difference between best-case, average, and\nworst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP\naddress appears earlier or later in the <code>KUBE-SERVICES</code> chain).</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like\nthis is to have a <em>single</em> rule, using a &quot;verdict map&quot; to do the\ndispatch:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>table ip kube-proxy {\n# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.\nmap service-ips {\ntype ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict\ncomment \"ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic\"\nelements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,\n172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,\n172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,\n... }\n}\n# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an\n# element in the map. (This rule says, \"construct a tuple from the\n# destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look\n# that tuple up in \"service-ips\"; and if there's a match, execute the\n# associated verdict.)\nchain services {\nip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips\n}\n...\n}\n</code></pre><p>Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly <strong>O(1)</strong> map lookup,\npacket processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster\nsize, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/nftables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the\niptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000\nServices, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as\nthe p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000\nService cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for\nnftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few\nmicroseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to\nsquint to see the nftables results!:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-2-control-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latency</h2>\n<p>While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are\ngreat, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often\nkeeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:\nthe time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when\nServices and their endpoints change.</p>\n<p>With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a\nwhole (actual rules, plus associated data) is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the combined\nnumber of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables\nbackend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of\nthousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of\niptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving\nkube-proxy so that it could skip updating <em>most</em> of the unchanged\nrules in each update, but the limitations of <code>iptables-restore</code> as an\nAPI meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's\n<strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller\nconstant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can\nstill be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's <code>minSyncPeriod</code> config\noption to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to\npush iptables updates.</p>\n<p>The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and\nwhen kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the\nupdate is only <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services and endpoints that\nhave changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of\nServices and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each\nnftables-using component to have its own private table also means that\nthere is no global lock contention between components like with\niptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much\nmore efficiently than with iptables.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-nftables\">Why <em>not</em> nftables?</h2>\n<p>All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump\nright into using the nftables backend for now.</p>\n<p>First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit\ntests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in\nthe real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as\nmuch real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise\nthat it is as stable and bug-free.</p>\n<p>Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;\ncurrently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of\nbugs in early versions of the <code>nft</code> command line tool, you should not\nrun kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier\nthan 1.0.0) version of <code>nft</code> in the host filesystem (or else\nkube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables\non the system).</p>\n<p>Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such\nas the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet\nsupport kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the\ndocumentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components\nto see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they\nwill not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or\noverride kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether\nkube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability\nand monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data\nfor kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in\niptables mode.</p>\n<p>Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%\ncompatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old\nkube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less\nperformant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that\nchanging the default would be a compatibility break. Since the\nnftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad\ndefaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In\nparticular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only\nreachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable\non all IPs, including <code>127.0.0.1</code>, with iptables mode.) The\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">kube-proxy documentation</a> has more information about this, including\ninformation about metrics you can look at to determine if you are\nrelying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration\noptions are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-out-nftables-mode\">Trying out nftables mode</h2>\n<p>Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to\npass <code>--proxy-mode nftables</code> to kube-proxy (or set <code>mode: nftables</code> in\nyour kube-proxy config file).</p>\n<p>If you are using kubeadm to set up your cluster, the kubeadm\ndocumentation explains <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/#customizing-kube-proxy\">how to pass a <code>KubeProxyConfiguration</code> to\n<code>kubeadm init</code></a>. You can also <a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#kube-proxy-mode\">deploy nftables-based clusters with\n<code>kind</code></a>.</p>\n<p>You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to\nnftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the\nkube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting\nin nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs\nrules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs\nmode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-plans\">Future plans</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, while nftables is now the <em>best</em> kube-proxy mode,\nit is not the <em>default</em>, and we do not yet have a plan for changing\nthat. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.</p>\n<p>The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main\nadvantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of\nthe IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes\n(for example, the fact that the <code>kube-ipvs0</code> device needs to have\n<em>every</em> Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of\nKubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement\nusing IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have\ndifferent endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a\nlocal or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same\nperformance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of\nthe downsides:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy ipvs-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/ipvs-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use\nvarious other IPVS functionality, like alternative &quot;schedulers&quot; for\nbalancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,\nbecause kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS\nschedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the\nproxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic\nmore cleverly.)</p>\n<p>While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop\nthe IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people\nwho are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode\ninstead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in\nnftables mode that you can't work around).</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md\">KEP-3866: Add an nftables-based kube-proxy backend</a>&quot; has the\nhistory of the new feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yOGHb2HjslY?si=6O4PVJu7fGpReo1U\">How the Tables Have Turned: Kubernetes Says Goodbye to IPTables</a>&quot;,\nfrom KubeCon/CloudNativeCon North America 2024, talks about porting\nkube-proxy and Calico from iptables to nftables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uYo2O3jbJLk?si=py2AXzMJZ4PuhxNg\">From Observability to Performance</a>&quot;, from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon\nNorth America 2024.

Since the logic has moved\nto the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg\">chicken and egg problem</a>\nduring the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the\ncontroller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,\nstandalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using\n<code>hostNetwork</code> (more on this below)</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-the-dependency-problem\">Examples of the dependency problem</h2>\n<p>As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be\nunschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p>\n<p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-uninitialized-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding <code>Node</code> object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a <code>Deployment</code>\nor <code>DaemonSet</code>, may not be able to schedule.</p>\n<p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting <code>Node</code> objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-not-ready-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3>\n<p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#node-kubernetes-io-not-ready\">Kubernetes documentation describes</a> the <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p>\n<p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-recommendations\">Our Recommendations</h2>\n<p>There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).</li>\n<li>Use a scalable resource type. <code>Deployments</code> and <code>DaemonSets</code> are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li>\n<li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol>\n<li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n<p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is\nimportant to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please\nconsult your cloud provider’s documentation.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nname: cloud-controller-manager\nnamespace: kube-system\nspec:\nreplicas: 2\nselector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nstrategy:\ntype: Recreate\ntemplate:\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nannotations:\nkubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure\nspec:\ncontainers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager\n- name: cloud-controller-manager\ncommand:\n- /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager\n- --leader-elect=true\n- -v=1\nimage: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest\nresources:\nrequests:\ncpu: 200m\nmemory: 50Mi\nhostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane\nnodeSelector:\nnode-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\"\naffinity:\npodAntiAffinity:\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n- topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\nlabelSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\ntolerations:\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\n</code></pre><p>When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that\ncluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple\nreplicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and\nredundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance\nof a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.</p>",

Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kirsten Garrison (KG)</strong>: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and\ncurrently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with\nthe help of <a href=\"https://github.com/carolynvs\">Carolyn Van Slyck</a>. With time, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.17/release_team.md\">I joined the Release\nteam</a>,\neventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I\nworked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in\nprocess) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and\ncontributing to the Subproject’s work.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of\nintervention?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/README.md#enhancements\">Enhancements\nSubproject</a>\nprimarily concerns itself with the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/0000-kep-process/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement\nProposal</a>\n(<em>KEP</em> for short)—the &quot;design&quot; documents required for all features and significant changes\nto the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kep-and-its-impact\">The KEP and its impact</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily\ninvolved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/#the-release-cycle\">Every release</a>, the SIGs let the\nRelease Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned\nabove, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors\nmust fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages\">will move\nthrough 3\nphases</a>:\nalpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.</p>\n<p>The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md\">KEP\ntemplate</a>\nhas different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed\ndiscussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and\nperformance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review\nteam and the Production Readiness Review team<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#fn:1\">1</a></sup> before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is\nlooking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and\nperformant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and\nmerge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most\nsignificant improvements of that approach?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on\nthe core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way\nto discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP\nprocess is communication and consideration.</p>\n<p>To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP\ntemplate. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancements</a> repo into its current form -- a\ndirectory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with\nProposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted\ntoday, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process\nin place over time.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single\nfeature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user\nexpectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The\naddition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements\n(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-areas-of-focus\">Current areas of focus</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: Speaking of maturing, we’ve <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/\">recently released Kubernetes\nv1.31</a>, and work on v1.32 <a href=\"https://github.com/fsmunoz/sig-release/tree/release-1.32/releases/release-1.32\">has\nstarted</a>. Are there\nany areas that the Enhancements sub-project is currently addressing that might change the way things\nare done?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: We’re currently working on two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Creating a Process KEP template.</em> Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for\nsignificant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to\nsupport this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so\nwill only encourage more discussion and transparency.</li>\n<li><em>KEP versioning.</em> While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we\nbelieve that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with\na versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we\nbelieve that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were\nintroduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was\nthis a particular area of focus for the subproject?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away\nfrom using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has\nalways been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition\nto an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads &quot;opt-in&quot; KEPs for release tracking. This\nhelped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken\non a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid\nintroducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the\nSubproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection\nprocess. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native\nlabels on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancement</a> issues and project boards.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the\nEnhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to\ndecisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to\ngive an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the\nRelease Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a\ngreat success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in\nthe KEP process!</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the\nrequired skills for participating in the sub-project?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the\nkubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take\nit from there.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to\nshare with our readers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires\nenormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it\nsuccessful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the\nproject great. This is truly a wonderful community.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>For more information, check the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/11/02/sig-architecture-production-readiness-spotlight-2023/\">Production Readiness Review spotlight\ninterview</a>\nin this series.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#fnref:1\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

      "summary": "<p>Volume group snapshots were <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/08/kubernetes-1-27-volume-group-snapshot-alpha/\">introduced</a>\nas an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release.\nThe recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to <strong>beta</strong>.\nThe support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/group-snapshot-restore-feature.html#volume-group-snapshot-apis\">extension APIs for group snapshots</a>.\nThese APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes.\nBehind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims\nfor snapshotting.\nA key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and\nrecover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.</p>\n<p>This new feature is only supported for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/\">CSI</a> volume drivers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-overview-of-volume-group-snapshots\">An overview of volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of\nmultiple volumes. A group snapshot represents <em>copies</em> made from multiple volumes, that\nare taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate\nnew volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to\na previous state (represented by the snapshots).</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-add-volume-group-snapshots-to-kubernetes\">Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes?</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that\nautomates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block\nand file storage.</p>\n<p>Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability:\nKubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and\nunderlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the\ncluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</p>\n<p>There was already a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/\">VolumeSnapshot</a> API\nthat provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against\ndata loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities\nnot covered by the VolumeSnapshot API.</p>\n<p>Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be\ntaken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency.\nThis can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example,\nan application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume.\nIf snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times,\nthe application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored\nfrom those snapshots when a disaster strikes.</p>\n<p>It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from\neach volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the\napplication after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get\napplication consistent snapshots.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes the application quiesce can be so time consuming that you want to do it less frequently,\nor it may not be possible to quiesce an application at all.\nFor example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce\nand nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which\nprovides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-apis-for-volume-group-snapshots\">Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes' support for <em>volume group snapshots</em> relies on three API kinds that\nare used\nfor managing snapshots:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshot</dt>\n<dd>Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request\ncreation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the\ntimestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use.\nThe creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a\ncluster resource (a group snapshot).</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</dt>\n<dd>Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group\nsnapshot ID.\nThis object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot).\nThe VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it\nwas created with a one-to-one mapping.</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotClass</dt>\n<dd>Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be\ncreated, including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These three API kinds are defined as\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">CustomResourceDefinitions</a>\n(CRDs).\nThese CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support\nvolume group snapshots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-components-are-needed-to-support-volume-group-snapshots\">What components are needed to support volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Volume group snapshots are implemented in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter\">external-snapshotter</a> repository.\nImplementing volume group snapshots meant adding or changing several components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs.</li>\n<li>Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller.</li>\n<li>Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The volume snapshot controller and CRDs are deployed once per\ncluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as a cluster addon.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends that Kubernetes distributors\nbundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part\nof their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-beta\">What's new in Beta?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The VolumeGroupSnapshot feature in CSI spec moved to GA in the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/releases/tag/v1.11.0\">v1.11.0 release</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The snapshot validation webhook was deprecated in external-snapshotter v8.0.0 and it is now removed.\nMost of the validation webhook logic was added as validation rules into the CRDs.\nMinimum required Kubernetes version is 1.25 for these validation rules.\nOne thing in the validation webhook not moved to CRDs is the prevention of creating\nmultiple default volume snapshot classes and multiple default volume group snapshot classes\nfor the same CSI driver.\nWith the removal of the validation webhook, an error will still be raised when dynamically\nprovisioning a VolumeSnapshot or VolumeGroupSnapshot when multiple default volume snapshot\nclasses or multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver exist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>enable-volumegroup-snapshot</code> flag in the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter\nsidecar has been replaced by a feature gate.\nSince VolumeGroupSnapshot is a new API, the feature moves to Beta but the feature gate is\ndisabled by default.\nTo use this feature, enable the feature gate by adding the flag <code>--feature-gates=CSIVolumeGroupSnapshot=true</code>\nwhen starting the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The logic to dynamically create the VolumeGroupSnapshot and its corresponding individual\nVolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects are moved from the CSI snapshotter to the common\nsnapshot-controller.\nNew RBAC rules are added to the common snapshot-controller and some RBAC rules are removed from\nthe CSI snapshotter sidecar accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots\">How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots</h2>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-new-group-snapshot-with-kubernetes\">Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to\nsnapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot\nobject.</p>\n<p>The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot\nshould be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent\nshould be used.</p>\n<p>A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a

Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple <strong>list</strong> requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage.\nWhile <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/\">API Priority and Fairness</a> has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection.\nThis can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded.\nThis situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let's consider the below graph.</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Monitoring graph showing kube-apiserver memory usage\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/17/kube-apiserver-api-streaming/kube-apiserver-memory_usage.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test.\n(see the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#the-synthetic-test\">synthetic test</a> section for more details).\nThe results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server's memory consumption.\nNotably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-kube-apiserver-allocate-so-much-memory-for-list-requests\">Why does kube-apiserver allocate so much memory for list requests?</h2>\n<p>Our investigation revealed that this substantial memory allocation occurs because the server before sending the first byte to the client must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fetch data from the database,</li>\n<li>deserialize the data from its stored format,</li>\n<li>and finally construct the final response by converting and serializing the data into a client requested format</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This sequence results in significant temporary memory consumption.\nThe actual usage depends on many factors like the page size, applied filters (e.g. label selectors), query parameters, and sizes of individual objects.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, neither <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/\">API Priority and Fairness</a> nor Golang's garbage collection or Golang memory limits can prevent the system from exhausting memory under these conditions.\nThe memory is allocated suddenly and rapidly, and just a few requests can quickly deplete the available memory, leading to resource exhaustion.</p>\n<p>Depending on how the API server is run on the node, it might either be killed through OOM by the kernel when exceeding the configured memory limits during these uncontrolled spikes, or if limits are not configured it might have even worse impact on the control plane node.\nAnd worst, after the first API server failure, the same requests will likely hit another control plane node in an HA setup with probably the same impact.\nPotentially a situation that is hard to diagnose and hard to recover from.</p>\n<h2 id=\"streaming-list-requests\">Streaming list requests</h2>\n<p>Today, we're excited to announce a major improvement.\nWith the graduation of the <em>watch list</em> feature to beta in Kubernetes 1.32, client-go users can opt-in (after explicitly enabling <code>WatchListClient</code> feature gate)\nto streaming lists by switching from <strong>list</strong> to (a special kind of) <strong>watch</strong> requests.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch</strong> requests are served from the <em>watch cache</em>, an in-memory cache designed to improve scalability of read operations.\nBy streaming each item individually instead of returning the entire collection, the new method maintains constant memory overhead.\nThe API server is bound by the maximum allowed size of an object in etcd plus a few additional allocations.\nThis approach drastically reduces the temporary memory usage compared to traditional <strong>list</strong> requests, ensuring a more efficient and stable system,\nespecially in clusters with a large number of objects of a given type or large average object sizes where despite paging memory consumption used to be high.</p>\n<p>Building on the insight gained from the synthetic test (see the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#the-synthetic-test\">synthetic test</a>, we developed an automated performance test to systematically evaluate the impact of the <em>watch list</em> feature.\nThis test replicates the same scenario, generating a large number of Secrets with a large payload, and scaling the number of informers to simulate heavy <strong>list</strong> request patterns.\nThe automated test is executed periodically to monitor memory usage of the server with the feature enabled and disabled.</p>\n<p>The results showed significant improvements with the <em>watch list</em> feature enabled.\nWith the feature turned on, the kube-apiserver’s memory consumption stabilized at approximately <strong>2 GB</strong>.\nBy contrast, with the feature disabled, memory usage increased to approximately <strong>20GB</strong>, a <strong>10x</strong> increase!\nThese results confirm the effectiveness of the new streaming API, which reduces the temporary memory footprint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-api-streaming-for-your-component\">Enabling API Streaming for your component</h2>\n<p>Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.32. Make sure your cluster uses etcd in version 3.4.31+ or 3.5.13+.\nChange your client software to use watch lists. If your client code is written in Golang, you'll want to enable <code>WatchListClient</code> for client-go.\nFor details on enabling that feature, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/12/feature-gates-in-client-go\">Introducing Feature Gates to Client-Go: Enhancing Flexibility and Control</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes 1.32, the feature is enabled in kube-controller-manager by default despite its beta state.\nThis will eventually be expanded to other core components like kube-scheduler or kubelet; once the feature becomes generally available, if not earlier.\nOther 3rd-party components are encouraged to opt-in to the feature during the beta phase, especially when they are at risk of accessing a large number of resources or kinds with potentially large object sizes.</p>\n<p>For the time being, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/\">API Priority and Fairness</a> assigns a reasonable small cost to <strong>list</strong> requests.\nThis is necessary to allow enough parallelism for the average case where <strong>list</strong> requests are cheap enough.\nBut it does not match the spiky exceptional situation of many and large objects.\nOnce the majority of the Kubernetes ecosystem has switched to <em>watch list</em>, the <strong>list</strong> cost estimation can be changed to larger values without risking degraded performance in the average case,\nand with that increasing the protection against this kind of requests that can still hit the API server in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-synthetic-test\">The synthetic test</h2>\n<p>In order to reproduce the issue, we conducted a manual test to understand the impact of <strong>list</strong> requests on kube-apiserver memory usage.\nIn the test, we created 400 Secrets, each containing 1 MB of data, and used informers to retrieve all Secrets.</p>\n<p>The results were alarming, only 16 informers were needed to cause the test server to run out of memory and crash, demonstrating how quickly memory consumption can grow under such conditions.</p>\n<p>Special shout out to <a href=\"https://github.com/deads2k\">@deads2k</a> for his help in shaping this feature.</p>",

You can only use the\npolicy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-feature\">Understanding the feature</h2>\n<p>The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#explicitly-reserved-cpu-list\">Explicitly Reserved CPU List</a> page.</p>\n<p>If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> option.</p>\n<p>However, until the Kubernetes v1.32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed\npods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs. At pod admission time, the kubelet only\ncompares the CPU <em>requests</em> against the allocatable CPUs. In Kubernetes, limits can be higher than\nthe requests; the previous implementation allowed burstable and best-effort pods to use up\nthe capacity of <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code>, which could then starve host OS services of CPU - and we\nknow that people saw this in real life deployments.\nThe existing behavior also made benchmarking (for both infrastructure and workloads) results inaccurate.</p>\n<p>When this new <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option is enabled, the CPU Manager static policy will not allow any workload to use the reserved system CPU cores.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-the-feature\">Enabling the feature</h2>\n<p>To enable this feature, you need to turn on both the <code>CPUManagerPolicyAlphaOptions</code> feature gate and the <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option.

The scheduler processes\nthese new Pods <strong>one by one</strong>. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important\nthe throughput of the scheduler becomes.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput\nof the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the\nscheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#extension-points\">scheduling context element</a>\nnamed <em>QueueingHint</em>. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how\nQueueingHint improves scheduling throughput.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scheduling-queue\">Scheduling queue</h2>\n<p>The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the <em>scheduling queue</em>.</p>\n<p>The scheduling queue consists of the following data structures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ActiveQ</strong>: holds newly created Pods or Pods that are ready to be retried for scheduling.</li>\n<li><strong>BackoffQ</strong>: holds Pods that are ready to be retried but are waiting for a backoff period to end. The\nbackoff period depends on the number of unsuccessful scheduling attempts performed by the scheduler on that Pod.</li>\n<li><strong>Unschedulable Pod Pool</strong>: holds Pods that the scheduler won't attempt to schedule for one of the\nfollowing reasons:\n<ul>\n<li>The scheduler previously attempted and was unable to schedule the Pods. Since that attempt, the cluster\nhasn't changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable.</li>\n<li>The Pods are blocked from entering the scheduling cycles by PreEnqueue Plugins,\nfor example, they have a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/#configuring-pod-schedulinggates\">scheduling gate</a>,\nand get blocked by the scheduling gate plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"scheduling-framework-and-plugins\">Scheduling framework and plugins</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes scheduler is implemented following the Kubernetes\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/\">scheduling framework</a>.</p>\n<p>And, all scheduling features are implemented as plugins\n(e.g., <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity\">Pod affinity</a>\nis implemented in the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin.)</p>\n<p>The scheduler processes pending Pods in phases called <em>cycles</em> as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scheduling cycle</strong>: the scheduler takes pending Pods from the activeQ component of the scheduling\nqueue <em>one by one</em>. For each Pod, the scheduler runs the filtering/scoring logic from every scheduling plugin. The\nscheduler then decides on the best node for the Pod, or decides that the Pod can't be scheduled at that time.</p>\n<p>If the scheduler decides that a Pod can't be scheduled, that Pod enters the Unschedulable Pod Pool\ncomponent of the scheduling queue. However, if the scheduler decides to place the Pod on a node,\nthe Pod goes to the binding cycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Binding cycle</strong>: the scheduler communicates the node placement decision to the Kubernetes API\nserver. This operation bounds the Pod to the selected node.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Aside from some exceptions, most unscheduled Pods enter the unschedulable pod pool after each scheduling\ncycle. The Unschedulable Pod Pool component is crucial because of how the scheduling cycle processes Pods one by one. If the scheduler had to constantly retry placing unschedulable Pods, instead of offloading those\nPods to the Unschedulable Pod Pool, multiple scheduling cycles would be wasted on those Pods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improvements-to-retrying-pod-scheduling-with-queuinghint\">Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint</h2>\n<p>Unschedulable Pods only move back into the ActiveQ or BackoffQ components of the scheduling\nqueue if changes in the cluster might allow the scheduler to place those Pods on nodes.</p>\n<p>Prior to v1.32, each plugin registered which cluster changes could solve their failures, an object creation, update, or deletion in the cluster (called <em>cluster events</em>),\nwith <code>EnqueueExtensions</code> (<code>EventsToRegister</code>),\nand the scheduling queue retries a pod with an event that is registered by a plugin that rejected the pod in a previous scheduling cycle.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we had an internal feature called <code>preCheck</code>, which helped further filtering of events for efficiency, based on Kubernetes core scheduling constraints;\nFor example, <code>preCheck</code> could filter out node-related events when the node status is <code>NotReady</code>.</p>\n<p>However, we had two issues for those approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requeueing with events was too broad, could lead to scheduling retries for no reason.\n<ul>\n<li>A new scheduled Pod <em>might</em> solve the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>'s failure, but not all of them do.\nFor example, if a new Pod is created, but without a label matching <code>InterPodAffinity</code> of the unschedulable pod, the pod wouldn't be schedulable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>preCheck</code> relied on the logic of in-tree plugins and was not extensible to custom plugins,\nlike in issue <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110175\">#110175</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here QueueingHints come into play;\na QueueingHint subscribes to a particular kind of cluster event, and make a decision about whether each incoming event could make the Pod schedulable.</p>\n<p>For example, consider a Pod named <code>pod-a</code> that has a required Pod affinity. <code>pod-a</code> was rejected in\nthe scheduling cycle by the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin because no node had an existing Pod that matched\nthe Pod affinity specification for <code>pod-a</code>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/12/scheduler-queueinghint/queueinghint1.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><code>pod-a</code> moves into the Unschedulable Pod Pool. The scheduling queue records which plugin caused\nthe scheduling failure for the Pod. For <code>pod-a</code>, the scheduling queue records that the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>\nplugin rejected the Pod.</p>\n<p><code>pod-a</code> will never be schedulable until the InterPodAffinity failure is resolved.\nThere're some scenarios that the failure could be resolved, one example is an existing running pod gets a label update and becomes matching a Pod affinity.\nFor this scenario, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> callback function checks every Pod label update that occurs in the cluster.\nThen, if a Pod gets a label update that matches the Pod affinity requirement of <code>pod-a</code>, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>,\nplugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> prompts the scheduling queue to move <code>pod-a</code> back into the ActiveQ or\nthe BackoffQ component.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a being moved by InterPodAffinity QueueingHint\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/12/scheduler-queueinghint/queueinghint2.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a being moved by InterPodAffinity QueueingHint</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"queueinghint-s-history-and-what-s-new-in-v1-32\">QueueingHint's history and what's new in v1.32</h2>\n<p>At SIG Scheduling, we have been working on the development of QueueingHint since\nKubernetes v1.28.</p>\n<p>While QueuingHint isn't user-facing, we implemented the <code>SchedulerQueueingHints</code> feature gate as a\nsafety measure when we originally added this feature. In v1.28, we implemented QueueingHints with a\nfew in-tree plugins experimentally, and made the feature gate enabled by default.</p>\n<p>However, users reported a memory leak, and consequently we disabled the feature gate in a\npatch release of v1.28. From v1.28 until v1.31, we kept working on the QueueingHint implementation\nwithin the rest of the in-tree plugins and fixing bugs.</p>\n<p>In v1.32, we made this feature enabled by default again. We finished implementing QueueingHints\nin all plugins and also identified the cause of the memory leak!</p>\n<p>We thank all the contributors who participated in the development of this feature and those who reported and investigated the earlier issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p>These features are managed by Kubernetes <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG Scheduling</a>.</p>\n<p>Please join us and share your feedback.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn more?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/4247-queueinghint/README.md\">KEP-4247: Per-plugin callback functions for efficient requeueing in the scheduling queue</a></li>\n</ul>",

Let's look at a few notable highlights from this release, which includes contributions from GitLab's Git team and the wider Git community.</p>\n<p>What's covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#git-backfill(1)-and-the-new-path-walk-api\">git-backfill(1) and the new path-walk API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#introduction-of-zlib-ng\">Introduction of zlib-ng</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#continued-iteration-on-meson\">Continued iteration on Meson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#deprecation-of-.gitbranches%2F-and-.git%2Fremotes%2F\">Deprecation of .git/branches/ and .git/remotes/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#rust-bindings-for-libgit\">Rust bindings for libgit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#new-name-hashing-algorithm\">New name-hashing algorithm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#promisor-remote-capability\">Promisor remote capability</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#thin-clone-using---revision\">Thin clone using <code>--revision</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>git-backfill(1) and the new path-walk API</h2>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone\"><code>git-clone(1)</code></a> a Git repository,\nyou can pass it the\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt-code--filterltfilter-specgtcode\"><code>--filter</code></a>\noption. Using this option allows you to create a <em>partial clone</em>. In a partial\nclone the server only sends a subset of reachable objects according to the given\nobject filter. For example, creating a clone with <code>--filter=blob:none</code> will not\nfetch any blobs (file contents) from the server and create a <em>blobless clone</em>.</p>\n<p>Blobless clones have all the reachable commits and trees, but no blobs. When you\nperform an operation like\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout\"><code>git-checkout(1)</code></a>, Git will download\nthe missing blobs to complete that operation. For some operations, like\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame\"><code>git-blame(1)</code></a>, this might result in\ndownloading objects one by one, which will slow down the command drastically.\nThis performance degradation occurs because <code>git-blame(1)</code> must traverse the\ncommit history to identify which specific blobs it needs, then request each\nmissing blob from the server separately.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.49, a new subcommand <code>git-backfill(1)</code> is introduced, which can be\nused to download missing blobs in a blobless partial clone.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, the <code>git-backfill(1)</code> command leverages the new path-walk API, which is different from how Git generally iterates over commits. Rather than iterating over the commits one at a time and recursively visiting the trees and blobs associated with each commit, the path-walk API does traversal by path. For each path, it adds a list of associated tree objects to a stack. This stack is then processed in a depth-first order. So, instead of processing every object in commit <code>1</code> before moving to commit <code>2</code>, it will process all versions of file <code>A</code> across all commits before moving to file <code>B</code>. This approach greatly improves performance in scenarios where grouping by path is essential.</p>\n<p>Let me demonstrate its use by making a blobless clone of <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git\"><code>gitlab-org/git</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git clone --filter=blob:none --bare --no-tags git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/git.git\nCloning into bare repository 'git.git'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 245904, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (1736/1736), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (276/276), done.\nremote: Total 245904 (delta 1591), reused 1547 (delta 1459), pack-reused 244168 (from 1)\nReceiving objects: 100% (245904/245904), 59.35 MiB | 15.96 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (161482/161482), done.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Above, we use <code>--bare</code> to ensure Git doesn't need to download any blobs to check\nout an initial branch.

Created in 1995, <code>zlib</code> has a long history and is incredibly\nportable, even supporting many systems that predate the Internet. Because of its\nwide support of architectures and compilers, it has limitations in what it is\ncapable of.</p>\n<p>The fork <a href=\"https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng\"><code>zlib-ng</code></a> was created to\naccommodate the limitations. <code>zlib-ng</code> aims to be optimized for modern\nsystems. This fork drops support for legacy systems and instead brings in\npatches for Intel optimizations, some Cloudflare optimizations, and a couple\nother smaller patches.</p>\n<p>The <code>zlib-ng</code> library itself provides a compatibility layer for <code>zlib</code>. The\ncompatibility later allows <code>zlib-ng</code> to be a drop-in replacement for <code>zlib</code>, but\nthat layer is not available on all Linux distributions.

But have you ever heard about the sub-directories <code>.git/branches/</code> and\n<code>.git/remotes/</code>? As you might know, reference to branches are stored in\n<code>.git/refs/heads/</code>, so that's not what <code>.git/branches/</code> is for, and what about\n<code>.git/remotes/</code>?</p>\n<p>Way back in 2005, <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch#_named_file_in_git_dirbranches\"><code>.git/branches/</code></a>\nwas introduced to store a shorthand name for a remote, and a few months later they were\nmoved to <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch#_named_file_in_git_dirremotes\"><code>.git/remotes/</code></a>.\nIn <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.63.0604301520460.2646@wbgn013.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/\">2006</a>,\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config\"><code>git-config(1)</code></a> learned to store\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-remoteltnamegturl\">remotes</a>.\nThis has become the standard way to configure remotes and, in 2011, the\ndirectories <code>.git/branches/</code> and <code>.git/remotes/</code> were\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git/-/commit/3d3d282146e13f2d7f055ad056956fd8e5d7ed29#e615263aaf131d42be8b0d0888ebd3fec954c6c9_132_124\">documented</a>\nas being &quot;legacy&quot; and no longer used in modern repositories.</p>\n<p>In 2024, the document <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/BreakingChanges\">BreakingChanges</a>\nwas started to outline breaking changes for the next major version of Git\n(v3.0).

This library\ncontains some of the core functionality of Git.</p>\n<p>While this library (and most of Git) is written in C, in Git 2.49 bindings were\nadded to make some of these functions available in Rust. To achieve this, two\nnew Cargo packages were created: <code>libgit-sys</code> and <code>libgit-rs</code>. These packages\nlive in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/tree/master/contrib\"><code>contrib/</code></a> subdirectory in the Git source tree.</p>\n<p>It's pretty\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages\">common</a>\nto split out a library into two packages when a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface\">Foreign Function\nInterface</a> is used.\nThe <code>libgit-sys</code> package provides the pure interface to C functions and links to\nthe native <code>libgit.a</code> library. The package <code>libgit-rs</code> provides a high-level\ninterface to the functions in <code>libgit-sys</code> with a feel that is more idiomatic to\nRust.</p>\n<p>So far, the functionality in these Rust packages is very limited. It only\nprovides an interface to interact with the <code>git-config(1)</code>.</p>\n<p>This initiative was led by <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/8793ff64a7f6c4c04dd03b71162a85849feda944.1738187176.git.steadmon@google.com/\">Josh Steadmon</a> and was merged with <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/a4af0b6288e25eb327ae9018cee09def9e43f1cd\">a4af0b6288</a>.</p>\n<h2>New name-hashing algorithm</h2>\n<p>The Git object database in <code>.git/</code> stores most of its data in packfiles. And\npackfiles are also used to submit objects between Git server and client over the\nwire.</p>\n<p>You can read all about the format at\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitformat-pack\"><code>gitformat-pack(5)</code></a>. One important\naspect of the packfiles is delta-compression. With delta-compression not every\nobject is stored as-is, but some objects are saved as a <em>delta</em> of another\n<em>base</em>. So instead of saving the full contents of the objects, changes compared\nto another object are stored.</p>\n<p>Without going into the details how these deltas are calculated or stored, you\ncan imagine that it is important group files together that are very similar. In\nv2.48 and earlier, Git looked at the last 16 characters of the path name to\ndetermine whether blobs might be similar. This algorithm is named version <code>1</code>.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.49, version <code>2</code> is available. This is an iteration on version <code>1</code>, but\nmodified so the effect of the parent directory is reduced. You can specify the\nname-hash algorithm version you want to use with option <code>--name-hash-version</code> of\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-repack\"><code>git-repack(1)</code></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stolee.dev/\">Derrick Stolee</a>, who drove this project, did some\ncomparison in resulting packfile size after running <code>git repack -adf --name-hash-version=&lt;n&gt;</code>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Repo</th>\n<th>Version 1 size</th>\n<th>Version 2 size</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui\">fluentui</a></td>\n<td>440 MB</td>\n<td>161 MB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repo B</td>\n<td>6,248 MB</td>\n<td>856 MB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repo C</td>\n<td>37,278 MB</td>\n<td>6,921 MB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repo D</td>\n<td>131,204 MB</td>\n<td>7,463 MB</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can read more of the details in the <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1823.v4.git.1738004554.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/\">patch\nset</a>,\nwhich is merged in\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/aae91a86fb2a71ff89a71b63ccec3a947b26ca51\">aae91a86fb</a>.</p>\n<h2>Promisor remote capability</h2>\n<p>It's known that Git isn't great in dealing with large files. There are some\nsolutions to this problem, like <a href=\"https://git-lfs.com/\">Git LFS</a>, but there are\nstill some shortcomings. To give a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With Git LFS the user has to configure which files to put in LFS. The server has\nno control about that and has to serve all files.</li>\n<li>Whenever a file is committed to the repository, there is no way to get it out\nagain without rewriting history. This is annoying, especially for large files,\nbecause they are stuck for eternity.</li>\n<li>Users cannot change their mind on which files to put into Git LFS.</li>\n<li>A tool like Git LFS requires significant effort to set up, learn, and use\ncorrectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For some time, Git has had the concept of promisor remotes. This feature can be used to deal with large files, and in Git 2.49 this feature took a step forward.</p>\n<p>The idea for the new “promisor-remote” capability is relatively simple: Instead of sending all\nobjects itself, a Git server can tell to the Git client &quot;Hey, go download these\nobjects from <em>XYZ</em>&quot;. <em>XYZ</em> would be a promisor remote.</p>\n<p>Git 2.49 enables the server to advertise the information of the promisor remote\nto the client. This change is an extension to\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitprotocol-v2\"><code>gitprotocol-v2</code></a>. While the server\nand the client are transmitting data to each other, the server can send  names and URLs of the promisor remotes it knows\nabout.</p>\n<p>So far, the client is not using the promisor remote info it gets from the server during clone, so all\nobjects are still transmitted from the remote the clone initiated from. We are planning to continue work on this feature, making it use promisor remote info from the server, and making it easier to use.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250218113204.2847463-1-christian.couder@gmail.com/\">patch\nset</a>\nwas submitted by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/chriscool\">Christian Couder</a> and merged\nwith\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/2c6fd30198187c928cbf927802556908c381799c\">2c6fd30198</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thin clone using <code>--revision</code></h2>\n<p>A new <code>--revision</code> option was added to\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone\"><code>git-clone(1)</code></a>. This enables you to create\na thin clone of a repository that only contains the history of the given\nrevision. The option is similar to <code>--branch</code>, but accepts a ref name (like\n<code>refs/heads/main</code>, <code>refs/tags/v1.0</code>, and <code>refs/merge-requests/123</code>) or a\nhexadecimal commit object ID. The difference to <code>--branch</code> is that it does not\ncreate a tracking branch and detaches <code>HEAD</code>. This means it's not suited if you\nwant to contribute back to that branch.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>--revision</code> in combination with <code>--depth</code> to create a very minimal\nclone. A suggested use-case is for automated testing. When you have a CI system\nthat needs to check out a branch (or any reference) to perform autonomous\ntesting on the source code, having a minimal clone is all you need.</p>\n<p>This\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/5785d9143bcb3ef19452a83bc2e870ff3d5ed95a\">change</a>\nwas\n<a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250206-toon-clone-refs-v7-0-4622b7392202@iotcl.com/\">driven</a>\nby <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/toon\">Toon Claes</a>.</p>\n<h1>Read more</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/10/whats-new-in-git-2-48-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.48.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/10/07/whats-new-in-git-2-47-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.47.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/07/29/whats-new-in-git-2-46-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.46.0?</a></li>\n</ul>",

Say goodbye to manual tasks and hello to streamlined efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Why automate your workflow?</h2>\n<p>Efficiency is key in software development. Automating repetitive tasks like triaging issues and merge requests frees up valuable time for your team to focus on what matters most: building amazing software.</p>\n<p>With <code>gitlab-triage</code>, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ensure consistency:</strong> Apply labels and assign issues automatically based on predefined rules.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve response times:</strong> Get immediate feedback on new issues and merge requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce manual effort:</strong> Eliminate the need for manual triage and updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Boost productivity:</strong> Free up your team to focus on coding and innovation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Introducing the <code>gitlab-triage</code> gem</h2>\n<p>The <code>gitlab-triage</code> gem is a Ruby library that allows you to create bots that interact with your GitLab projects. These bots can automatically perform a wide range of actions, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Automatically categorize issues and merge requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Commenting:</strong> Provide updates, request information, or give feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Assigning:</strong> Assign issues and merge requests to the appropriate team members.</li>\n<li><strong>Closing:</strong> Close stale or resolved issues and merge requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Creating:</strong> Generate new issues based on specific events or conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>And much more!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage\"><code>gitlab-triage</code> gem repository</a>.</p>\n<h2>Setting up your triage bot</h2>\n<p>Let's get your first triage bot up and running!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the gem. (Note: The gem command is available with Ruby programming language installed.)</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gem install gitlab-triage\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Get your GitLab API token.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your GitLab <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/-/profile/preferences\">profile settings</a>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Access Tokens</strong>.</li>\n<li>Create a new token with the <code>api</code> scope.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your token secure and set an expiration date for it based on when you will be done with this walkthrough!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Define your triage policies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Create a file named <code>.triage-policies.yml</code> in your project's root directory. This file will contain the rules that govern your bot's behavior. Here's a simple example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\n---\n- name: &quot;Apply 'WIP' label&quot;\n  condition:\n    draft: true\n  action:\n    labels:\n      - status::wip\n\n- name: &quot;Request more information on old issue&quot;\n  condition:\n   date:\n    attribute: updated_at\n    condition: older_than\n    interval_type: months\n    interval: 12\n  action:\n    comment: |\n      {{author}} This issue has been open for more than 12 months, is this still an issue?\n</code></pre>\n<p>This configuration defines two policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first policy applies the <code>status::wip</code> label to any issue that is in draft.</li>\n<li>The second policy adds a comment to an issue that the issue has not been updated in 12 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Run your bot.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can run your bot manually using the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gitlab-triage -t &lt;your_api_token&gt; -p &lt;your_project_id&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Replace <code>&lt;your_api_token&gt;</code> with your GitLab API token and <code>&lt;your_project_id&gt;</code> with the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/working_with_projects/#access-a-project-by-using-the-project-id\">ID of your GitLab project</a>. If you would like to see the impact of actions before they are taken, you can add the <code>-n</code> or <code>--dry-run</code> to test out the policies first.</p>\n<h2>Automating with GitLab CI/CD</h2>\n<p>To automate the execution of your triage bot, integrate it with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/06/ultimate-guide-to-ci-cd-fundamentals-to-advanced-implementation/\">GitLab CI/CD</a>. Here's an example <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> configuration:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\ntriage:\n  script:\n    - gem install gitlab-triage\n    - gitlab-triage -t $GITLAB_TOKEN -p $CI_PROJECT_ID\n  only:\n    - schedules\n</code></pre>\n<p>This configuration defines a job named &quot;triage&quot; that installs the <code>gitlab-triage</code> gem and runs the bot using the <code>$GITLAB_TOKEN</code> (a predefined <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/\">CI/CD variable</a>) and the <code>$CI_PROJECT_ID</code> variable. The <code>only: schedules</code> clause ensures that the job runs only on a schedule.</p>\n<p>To create a <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html\">schedule</a>, go to your project's <strong>CI/CD</strong> settings and navigate to <strong>Schedules</strong>. Create a new schedule and define the frequency at which you want your bot to run (e.g., daily, hourly).</p>\n<h2>Advanced triage policies</h2>\n<p><code>gitlab-triage</code> offers a range of advanced features for creating more complex triage policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regular expressions:</strong> Use regular expressions for more powerful pattern matching.</li>\n<li><strong>Summary policies:</strong> Consolidate related issues into a single summary issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom actions:</strong> Define custom actions using <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage#can-i-customize\">Ruby code blocks</a> to perform more complex operations using the GitLab API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are two advanced real-world examples from the triage bot used by the Developer Advocacy team at GitLab. You can view the full policies in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/projects/devrel-bot/-/blob/master/.triage-policies.yml?ref_type=heads\">this file</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">- name: Issues where DA team member is an assignee outside DA-Meta project i.e. DevRel-Influenced\n  conditions:\n    assignee_member:\n      source: group\n      condition: member_of\n      source_id: 1008\n    state: opened\n    ruby: get_project_id != 18 \n    forbidden_labels:\n      - developer-advocacy\n  actions:   \n    labels:\n      - developer-advocacy\n      - DevRel-Influenced\n      - DA-Bot::Skip\n</code></pre>\n<p>This example for issues across a group, excluding those in the project with the ID of 18, have assignees who are members of the group with ID of 1008 and do not have the label <code>developer-advocacy</code> on them. This policy helps the Developer Advocacy team at GitLab to find issues members of the team are assigned to but are not in their team’s project. This helps the team identify and keep track of contributions made outside of the team by adding the teams’ labels.</p>\n<pre><code>- name: Missing Due Dates\n  conditions:\n    ruby: missing_due_date\n    state: opened\n    labels:\n      - developer-advocacy\n    forbidden_labels:\n      - DA-Due::N/A\n      - DA-Bot::Skip\n      - DA-Status::FYI\n      - DA-Status::OnHold\n      - CFP\n      - DA-Bot::Triage\n  actions:\n    labels:\n      - DA-Bot-Auto-Due-Date\n    comment: |\n      /due #{get_current_quarter_last_date}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This second example checks for all issues with the <code>developer-advocacy</code> label, which do not include labels in the forbidden labels list and when their due dates have passed.

      "summary": "<p>Development and security teams are often overwhelmed by the number of vulnerabilities they need to remediate. Many organizations remediate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14172\">less than 16%</a> of their known vulnerabilities monthly. Vulnerability management teams face a constant challenge: which security flaws deserve immediate attention? Three key frameworks help answer this question: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss\">CVSS</a>), Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\">KEV</a>), and Exploit Prediction Scoring System (<a href=\"https://www.first.org/epss/\">EPSS</a>). The <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/02/20/gitlab-17-9-released/\">GitLab 17.9 release</a> adds support for these frameworks. In this article, you'll learn how to use these frameworks within GitLab to efficiently prioritize risk across your dependency and container image vulnerabilities using this data.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Vulnerability risk assessment data\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/7nzhbKHvicBjJsi9mRlYjf/7bd48bd3af76d56707690f84745bb6f7/vulnerability_data.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vulnerability risk assessment data&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>CVSS</h2>\n<p>CVSS provides a standardized method for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater severity.</p>\n<p>CVSS evaluates vulnerabilities across three dimension groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base metrics: intrinsic qualities that don't change over time (attack complexity, privileges   required)</li>\n<li>Temporal metrics: factors that evolve (exploit maturity, remediation level)</li>\n<li>Environmental metrics: organization-specific impact considerations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CVSS offers a consistent severity baseline and common language for security teams. Its comprehensive scoring methodology considers multiple aspects of a vulnerability's technical impact.</p>\n<h2>KEV</h2>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) maintains the KEV catalog, which identifies vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild.</p>\n<p>Unlike academic severity scores, KEV focuses on real-world threat intelligence. Each entry includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CVE identifier</li>\n<li>Vulnerability name</li>\n<li>Action required</li>\n<li>Due date for remediation (for federal agencies)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>KEV provides actionable intelligence based on observed threat actor behavior. It cuts through scoring complexity with a binary signal: &quot;This vulnerability is being actively exploited right now.&quot;</p>\n<h2>EPSS</h2>\n<p>The EPSS uses machine learning to predict the likelihood a vulnerability will be exploited in the next 30 days. Scores range from 0 to 1 (or 0%-100%), representing probability.</p>\n<p>EPSS analyzes hundreds of factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical characteristics</li>\n<li>Social media mentions</li>\n<li>Exploit availability</li>\n<li>Vulnerability age</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EPSS brings risk-based prioritization to vulnerability management. Rather than focusing solely on technical severity, it helps teams understand which vulnerabilities attackers are most likely to target.</p>\n<h2>Combining the frameworks for effective prioritization</h2>\n<p>Each framework serves a unique purpose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CVSS indicates how severe a vulnerability is technically.</li>\n<li>KEV indicates which vulnerabilities are actively being exploited.</li>\n<li>EPSS indicates which vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An effective prioritization strategy leverages all three:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with KEV-listed vulnerabilities as immediate priorities.</li>\n<li>Use EPSS to identify high-probability threats not yet on KEV.</li>\n<li>Consider CVSS for understanding technical impact.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By combining these complementary frameworks, security teams can focus limited resources on the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest actual risk to their organizations. You can get started with prioritizing vulnerabilities with GitLab by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Adding security scanners to your pipeline</li>\n<li>Viewing vulnerability insights</li>\n<li>Setting the vulnerability status based metrics</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Watch this video to learn more:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-dWwoKfCHw?si=iC73JCRsxPUEWKf-&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<h3>Adding security scanners to your pipeline</h3>\n<p>GitLab provides built-in security scanning tools through its templates that can be integrated directly into your CI/CD pipeline. GitLab offers several security scanners that address different aspects of your application security:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/\">Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</a>:</strong> Analyzes your source code for known vulnerabilities</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dast/\">Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</a>:</strong> Tests your running application for vulnerabilities</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/\">Dependency Scanning</a>:</strong> Checks your dependencies for known vulnerabilities</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/container_scanning/\">Container Scanning</a>:</strong> Identifies vulnerabilities in container images</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/\">Secret Detection</a>:</strong> Finds secrets and credentials accidentally committed to your repository</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/iac_scanning/\">Infrastructure as Code Scanning</a>:</strong> Detects security issues in IaC files</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/coverage_fuzzing/\">Coverage-guided Fuzzing</a>:</strong> Sends random inputs to an instrumented version of your application in an effort to detect bugs</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/api_fuzzing/\">Web API Fuzzing</a>:</strong> Sets operation parameters to unexpected values in an effort to cause unexpected behavior and errors in the API backend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To add them to your pipeline, simply add the appropriate templates to <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file. For example, adding SAST and Dependency Scanning to your pipeline is as simple as:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">include:  \n  - template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml  \n  - template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nstages:  \n  - test  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you commit the above changes, security scanners will begin to run. These scanners can be further configured to meet the needs of your organization. To learn more about our various scanners, see the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/\">GitLab application security documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> EPSS and KEV metrics are only provided for <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/\">dependency</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/container_scanning/\">container image</a> vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3>Viewing vulnerability insights</h3>\n<p>Once a pipeline with your security scanners is run on the default branch, you can access the vulnerability report. The vulnerability report provides a consolidated view of all security vulnerabilities detected across your project by GitLab's security scanners. You can access it from your project by going to the side-tab and selecting <strong>Secure &gt; Vulnerability Report</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Vulnerability report grouped by tool\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2aP7NfnjJXScSxopiE5GHx/b1b51f8cb454038a2b320ab6886ad87c/vulnerability_report__1_.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vulnerability report grouped by tool&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>From the vulnerability report, select a vulnerability to see its insights page, which includes the severity, EPSS, KEV, and CVSS along with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>description</li>\n<li>when it was detected</li>\n<li>current status</li>\n<li>available actions</li>\n<li>linked issues</li>\n<li>actions log</li>\n<li>filename and line number of the vulnerability (if available)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data can be used to effectively triage, remediate, or mitigate the vulnerability.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> From the insights page, you can also leverage GitLab Duo’s AI capabilities to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-explanation\">explain</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-resolution\">auto-resolve</a> a vulnerability.</p>\n<h3>Setting the vulnerability status-based metrics</h3>\n<p>After examining the provided data, we can go ahead and change the status of our vulnerability by clicking the <strong>Change status</strong> button:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Change vulnerability status from insights page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/6LggzuPyiVGzd8PIzPDtIS/1cf5f83a989f558c69eba33bac863c44/change_status.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Change vulnerability status from insights page&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>Then we'll see a popup that will allow you to change the status of a vulnerability:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Change vulnerability status option\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/6IdOP9DmSC4rrYR7BIIFfy/e61d0f68a4750b1f40471445055df113/change_status_2.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Change vulnerability status option&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>When you dismiss a vulnerability you can choose one of the following reasons and optionally provide a comment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acceptable risk:</strong> The vulnerability is known, and has not been remediated or mitigated, but is considered to be an acceptable business risk.</li>\n<li><strong>False positive:</strong> An error in reporting in which a test result incorrectly indicates the presence of a vulnerability in a system when the vulnerability is not present.</li>\n<li><strong>Mitigating control:</strong> The vulnerability’s risk is mitigated by a management, operational, or technical control (that is, safeguard or countermeasure) employed by an organization that provides equivalent or comparable protection for an information system.</li>\n<li><strong>Used in tests:</strong> The finding is not a vulnerability because it is part of a test or is test data.</li>\n<li><strong>Not applicable:</strong> The vulnerability is known, and has not been remediated or mitigated, but is considered to be in a part of the application that will not be updated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there you have it, quick and easy vulnerability risk prioritization with GitLab!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get started today with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/ultimate/\">a free, 60-day trial of GitLab Ultimate</a>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n<p>To learn more about GitLab security and governance features and how we can help enhance your security posture, check out the following resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/risk_assessment_data/\">GitLab Risk Assessment Data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/security-compliance/\">GitLab Security and Compliance Solutions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/\">GitLab Application Security documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11544\">GitLab Risk Assessment Data epic</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>At GitLab, we’ve implemented an innovative approach to improving our experience called <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-design/#beautifying-our-ui\">Beautifying our UI</a>. This unique initiative pairs one product designer with a frontend engineer for a milestone or two, and empowers them to make self-directed usability improvements across the platform. Ultimately, this helps build a more polished product experience, as these pairs can quickly address pain points, refine interactions, and deliver thoughtful improvements that make the platform more efficient and enjoyable to use.</p>\n<p>In this iteration, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/anna_vovchenko\">Anna Vovchenko</a> and I decided to focus on the continuous deployment (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/#what-is-continuous-deployment\">CD</a>) area of the product. Here is how we did it and what we learned.</p>\n<h2>Trying something new</h2>\n<p>As this was our second round going through the process, we wanted to make several small adjustments that in the end helped us deliver even more quality improvements to the product. These process improvements included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extended timeline:</strong> We decided this time around we wanted to extend the initiative to span two milestones. This gave us the time to tackle more complex problems, but also gave us space for additional planning at the start.</li>\n<li><strong>Structured planning:</strong> While it was encouraged in the past to work directly in merge requests, we found it helped to use the initial issue as a place to plan and seek out problems ahead of time. Rather than purely focusing on the ad-hoc, we incorporated a planning phase similar to milestone planning, helping the partnership identify and prioritize potential improvements beforehand.</li>\n<li><strong>Product manager integration:</strong> As we focused on one area for this round of the project, we also decided to involve the product manager of the team more actively in the process. This ensured alignment on larger changes, reduced surprises when MRs were merged and allowed us to gather valuable feedback throughout the implementation.</li>\n<li><strong>Engaging the community:</strong> We expanded our improvement efforts by inviting contributions from community members, accelerating our ability to implement fixes and enhancements across the platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic timing:</strong> We chose to run this iteration during a traditionally slower period, allowing teams to focus more deeply on these improvements without competing priorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These refinements maintained the initiative's core strength of direct designer-engineer collaboration, while adding structure that helped our pair work more effectively.</p>\n<h2>What were the main improvements?</h2>\n<p>During the two milestones, our pairing implemented several significant improvements that enhance the user experience across the CD space. Here's a look at what we accomplished:</p>\n<h3>Enhanced environment list view</h3>\n<p>One of the larger changes made during this cycle of &quot;Beautifying our UI&quot; was a redesigned Environment List page to make deployment information more accessible. Previously, users had to click through collapsible sections to view crucial deployment details, and viewing important details at a glance was difficult. Now, this information is immediately visible, bringing the most important deployment information to the forefront where users need it.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Environments page before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3PNIW6wr7PjXj56eIckxYR/118bd0134f6ef21dd4876e50842ba5d6/Before_Environments_Page.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong> The original design relied on collapsible sections, requiring users to click to reveal deployment information. This meant that users couldn't immediately see the status of their deployments, making it harder to quickly assess the state of their environments.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Environments page after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5IXx6EwEFpIlU5IpvlASUV/ab333877441cf3c2ea8dd722f095bac0/After_Environments_Page.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong> The new design surfaces critical deployment information directly in the list view, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployment status with clear visual indicators</li>\n<li>Who triggered the deployment along with timestamps</li>\n<li>Commit information and version tags</li>\n<li>Actions to take on the environment</li>\n<li>Latest deployment indicators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This redesign eliminates the need for extra clicks and gives users immediate visibility into their deployment and environment statuses. The new layout maintains a clean interface while presenting more actionable information upfront.</p>\n<h3>Improved deploy keys filtering</h3>\n<p>Another larger enhancement was made to our deploy keys interface to improve searchability while maintaining performance. This change addresses a critical user need for quickly finding specific deploy keys in large repositories, which was broken when pagination was introduced earlier last year.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Deploy key before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/0wZRhTpbwYkWBBLB8HhYn/83724f401fc61a85ea5d7f0cf9ebf1ee/Deploy_Key_Before.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong> The previous interface displayed deploy keys in a paginated list without a dedicated search function. While pagination helped with performance when handling thousands of keys, users had lost the ability to quickly search through their deploy keys using the browser search functionality, forcing them to manually scan through multiple pages.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Deploy key after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/63bgcl0bSSoGQXZW8Dx4Rk/7a6bb7e089be6d297690a29ff5e4b39a/Deploy_Key_After.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong> The new design introduces a dedicated search field at the top of the deploy keys list, allowing users to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly filter deploy keys by name or SHA</li>\n<li>Maintain the performance benefits of pagination</li>\n<li>Find specific keys without browsing through multiple pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This improvement strikes the right balance between performance and usability, especially beneficial for teams managing numerous deploy keys across multiple projects.</p>\n<h3>Better Kubernetes agent management</h3>\n<p>We made significant improvements to the Kubernetes agent experience by simplifying the registration process and providing better visibility into agent status. These enhancements work together to create a smoother onboarding experience for teams getting started.</p>\n<p>Our first area of focus was streamlining how users register agents when they have configuration files ready to use. Previously, this process had several pain points that we wanted to address.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Agent before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4nQ26pVg2pullsURbdUuUO/2ba71a65e0ff6227c611e806daeb4c5f/Agent_Before.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only showed connected and previously connected agents</li>\n<li>Connection status was limited to &quot;Never connected&quot; or &quot;Not connected&quot;</li>\n<li>No clear path to register new agents</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Agent after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/1khmWXmfgnZxLkImL98jqX/5d50e88e8398b292af8159c25c22865d/Agent_After.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new Available configurations tab showing all potential agent configurations</li>\n<li>Clear &quot;Register an agent&quot; call-to-action button for each available configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we turned our attention to making the agent registration modal more intuitive. The previous design created some confusion that we wanted to resolve.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Registration before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/6UGHFXFRTWtMEOMRNnMC3n/308c56bff1ff25512962c9fa2a78ca38/Registration_Before.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users faced a confusing dual-purpose search box that both found existing agents and created new ones</li>\n<li>The workflow had too many decision points instead of a clear path forward</li>\n<li>The process for creating vs. selecting an agent wasn't clearly separated</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Registration after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5IqK5YIFaVuVXh2p1zMf4t/575dfe8a2827e61204fe8322639c1294/Registration_After.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Separated the interface into two clear options: bootstrap with Flux or create an agent through the UI</li>\n<li>Streamlined the workflow into a more linear process</li>\n<li>Made the distinction between creating new agents and selecting existing ones more obvious</li>\n<li>Added a success message that clearly shows where to create the optional config file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These improvements make it immediately clear which agents need attention and provide a straightforward path to register new agents. The reorganized interface better supports both new users setting up their first agent and experienced users managing multiple agents.</p>\n<h2>Additional usability enhancements</h2>\n<p>While working on major interface improvements, we also addressed several focused usability issues that significantly improve the day-to-day experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Kubernetes pod search:</strong> Added search functionality for Kubernetes pods on the environment page, making it easier to locate specific pods in large deployments. This was showcased in the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/01/16/gitlab-17-8-released/#search-for-pods-on-the-dashboard-for-kubernetes\">GitLab 17.8 release post</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Flux status visibility:</strong> Added a &quot;stopped&quot; badge to the dashboard view when Flux sync is stopped, providing immediate visibility into sync status. This was also showcased in the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/01/16/gitlab-17-8-released/#view-paused-flux-reconciliations-on-the-dashboard-for-kubernetes\">GitLab 17.8 release post</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Better release information:</strong> Implemented a clear view of deployments related to a release, improving deployment tracking and visibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined environment search:</strong> Fixed an issue where users couldn't effectively search the Environments page, improving navigation in large environment lists.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced error message display:</strong> Resolved issues with viewing Flux details when long error messages were present, making troubleshooting more straightforward.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Looking forward</h2>\n<p>The success of these improvements demonstrates the value of empowering our teams to make direct, meaningful changes to our experience. Beyond the product enhancements, one of the most valuable outcomes has been the strengthened relationship between our Frontend and Design teams. Working together closely on these improvements has fostered better understanding of each other's perspectives, workflows, and constraints, leading to more effective collaboration.</p>\n<p>This deepened partnership has created a foundation for even better collaboration in our regular workflow, as team members now have stronger working relationships and shared understanding of each other's domains. We're excited to continue this initiative in future iterations, not just for the product improvements it generates, but also for its role in building stronger, more cohesive teams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-design/#beautifying-our-ui\">Follow along with the &quot;Beautifying our UI&quot; project</a> as we continue to make improvements to GitLab.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Read more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/08/15/navigation-research-blog-post/\">How we overhauled GitLab navigation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/10/15/gitlab-dark-mode-is-getting-a-new-look/\">GitLab dark mode is getting a new look</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/07/05/beautifying-of-our-ui/\">Beautifying our UI: Giving GitLab build features a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>In early 2024, we started a journey to implement better metrics for <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-operations/red-team/\">our internal Red Team</a>. Our first iteration focused on what we now call the adoption rate metric, which measures how often the recommendations our team makes are accepted and implemented.</p>\n<p>Choosing this metric was very deliberate. While there are many ways to measure a Red Team's impact, we wanted to start with something fundamental: Are we actually driving meaningful security improvements? The adoption rate directly ties our work to real security outcomes, and we could measure it using tools and processes we already had in place.</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll discover how we used GitLab to track these results end-to-end, some lessons we learned (including what we would have done differently), and our plans to tackle the next set of metrics.</p>\n<h2>How we implemented the adoption rate metric</h2>\n<p>We use GitLab extensively for our Red Team planning, execution, and reporting. Every operation wraps up with a report that's written in markdown in a dedicated GitLab project. Each report contains a section called &quot;Recommendations&quot; with a list of suggestions to make GitLab more secure.</p>\n<p>Those recommendations are always linked to a dedicated issue, which we open in the project closest to the team who can address it. If we're suggesting a product feature, it goes directly in that tracker. If it's a detection capability, it goes into the detections as code repository. We always assign a directly responsible individual (DRI) in the group that owns that space, and we use <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/redteam/redteam-public/resources/red-team-issue-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/recommendation.md?ref_type=heads\">this issue template</a> to ensure consistency in describing the problem, the risk, and potential solutions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Red team - recommendation-example\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/73y1KlWLKWijWmoQjPaS9z/6311f485b2a68bd16c64bd79b434c1eb/recommendation-example__1_.png\" /></p>\n<p>Here's where the tracking logistics come in. We use GitLab labels to classify the recommendation across three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detections and alerts (<code>RTRec::Detection</code>)</li>\n<li>Security controls (<code>RTRec::Control</code>)</li>\n<li>Processes and procedures (<code>RTRec::Process</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then use another set of labels to follow the lifecycle of that recommendation – from review all the way through adoption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under review (<code>RecOutcome::UnderReview</code>)</li>\n<li>Accepted and actively being worked on (<code>RecOutcome::InProgress</code>)</li>\n<li>Accepted but backlogged (<code>RecOutcome::Backlogged</code>)</li>\n<li>Accepted but blocked (<code>RecOutcome::Blocked</code>)</li>\n<li>Fully adopted and closed (<code>RecOutcome::Adopted</code>)</li>\n<li>Partially adopted and closed (<code>RecOutcome::PartiallyAdopted</code>)</li>\n<li>Not adopted and closed (<code>RecOutcome::NotAdopted</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we stay on top of recommendations</h2>\n<p>We use a new GitLab feature called <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/glql/\">&quot;GitLab Query Language&quot; (GLQL)</a> to build a dynamic Security Recommendations Dashboard inside a GitLab issue.</p>\n<p>This issue allows us to quickly identify things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>open recommendations that haven't been updated recently</li>\n<li>open recommendations that have been backlogged for an extended period of time</li>\n<li>closed recommendations that weren't properly labeled with an adoption outcome</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We've found this process encourages the Red Team to follow up on stale recommendations, reaching out to the owners and seeing how we can help get them adopted.</p>\n<p>GLQL is very cool, and allows us to turn a short code block like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">---  \ndisplay: table  \nfields: title, labels(&quot;RTRec::*&quot;), labels(&quot;RecOutcome::*&quot;), created, updated  \n---  \ngroup = &quot;gitlab-com&quot;  \nAND label = &quot;RTRec::*&quot;  \nAND opened = true  \n</code></pre>\n<p>... into a dynamic table like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Red Team - GLQL table\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2lPijOJclw45o0Qi6HqdXd/664f11ca26dc8f80e3e1508481ee3abe/glql-table.png\" /></p>\n<p>That table for us is very tactical and we use it to keep things moving. Beyond that, we also visualize the adoption rate trends over time. That allows us to look at things like quarterly adoption rate percentages, how long different types of recommendations take to adopt and implement, and how these figures vary across departments.</p>\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Start with metrics in place; don't wait for your program to mature first.</strong></p>\n<p>Early in our Red Team's development, we focused more on how we would execute operations and less on how we would measure them. The idea of using metrics to distill complex operations into simple numbers felt like it might oversimplify our work. But we've learned that thoughtful metrics don't reduce the value of Red Team operations - they help demonstrate our impact and guide our program's growth. Starting with clear metrics earlier would have accelerated this growth.</p>\n<p>Implementing these metrics later meant spending significant time reformatting years of historical recommendations to enable consistent analysis. Had we planned for metrics from the start, we could have saved ourselves a lot of time and effort.</p>\n<p>We’re keeping this lesson in mind as we start on our next set of metrics, threat resilience, which we talk about below.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Don't operate in a silo.</strong></p>\n<p>Red Teams aren't the only groups that provide recommendations in a security organization. At GitLab, we have our bug bounty program, our external pentests, product security, security assurance, and security operations.</p>\n<p>On the Red Team, we developed our own recommendations process from scratch. It's been fairly effective, but we have noticed some areas for improvement, particularly around prioritization, project management, and alignment with our organization's risk reporting process.</p>\n<p>We also noticed that some other teams are really good at these areas such as our bug bounty program and the triaging of findings from our external pentests. Those particular groups are very good at delivering product recommendations, and we've been learning from their approach to improve our own delivery methods.</p>\n<p>So we've taken our success with visualizing metrics and are integrating these lessons to create a more standard format that can be used across teams. This will allow us to leverage things that are working well, like our adoption rate metric, and combine them with the more efficiently managed processes used by other groups to ultimately achieve a higher adoption rate and a more secure GitLab.</p>\n<h2>Next up: Measuring our threat resilience</h2>\n<p>Next up for us is implementing metrics around threat resilience. We want to measure how well GitLab can prevent, detect, and respond to the threats most relevant to our organization. We're building a dashboard that will help visualize this data, showing our top threat actors and a series of scores that measure how well we defend against their specific techniques.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to have this dashboard drive decisions around what Red Team operations to conduct, what defensive capabilities to improve, and in general where we should be investing time and effort across our entire security division.</p>\n<p>We hope to consolidate our existing tools in this process and are currently evaluating solutions. We'll share more info when we've achieved some success here.</p>\n<h2>Key takeaways and how to get started</h2>\n<p>If you're looking to measure your Red Team's impact, here's what we've learned:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start tracking metrics early, even if they're not perfect.</li>\n<li>Focus on actionable metrics first (like adoption rate).</li>\n<li>Use your existing tools. We used GitLab and Tableau, but the approach works with any tracking system.</li>\n<li>Collaborate across security teams to leverage existing processes when possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We'd love to hear about your experience with metrics in security so drop a comment below or open an issue in one of our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/redteam/redteam-public\">public projects</a>.</p>\n<h2>Read more from GitLab's Red Team</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/11/20/stealth-operations-the-evolution-of-gitlabs-red-team/\">Stealth operations: The evolution of GitLab's Red Team</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/11/28/how-gitlabs-red-team-automates-c2-testing/\">How GitLab's Red Team automates C2 testing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/05/11/how-we-run-red-team-operations-remotely/\">How we run Red Team operations remotely</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>As companies rapidly adopt AI technologies, CISOs face a new frontier of security challenges. Many security leaders find themselves grappling with unfamiliar questions: How do we evaluate AI vendors differently from traditional software vendors? What security controls matter most? Where does vendor responsibility end and customer responsibility begin? How do we evaluate AI security risks within the context of the service provided? To help answer these questions, we’ve created the <a href=\"https://trust.gitlab.com/?itemUid=ad3d92c1-889e-49fc-b19c-2434f70071ee&amp;source=click\">GitLab AI Security Framework</a> to show security leaders how GitLab and customers enable secure AI-powered development using GitLab Duo.</p>\n<h2>The genesis of AI security challenges</h2>\n<p>From conversations with security leaders across industries a pattern has emerged: Organizations are rapidly embracing AI technologies to improve delivery while their security teams struggle to establish appropriate security controls.</p>\n<p>This disconnect isn't just a matter of resources or expertise – it represents a fundamental shift in how organizations need to approach security in the AI era. Security leaders are witnessing quick and unprecedented adoption of AI across their organizations, from development teams using coding assistants to marketing departments leveraging generative AI.</p>\n<p>While organizations are integrating AI within their own software, many of their current vendor-provided SaaS applications have added AI capabilities as well. Although this adoption drives innovation and efficiency, it also creates a complex set of security considerations that traditional frameworks weren't designed to address. Below are some of the specific challenges we’ve identified.</p>\n<h2>Security challenges in the AI era</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Responsibility and control uncertainty</strong></p>\n<p>The rapid pace of AI adoption has left many organizations without a coherent security governance strategy. Security teams find themselves trying to retrofit existing security frameworks to address AI-specific concerns. Security leaders face challenges in understanding where their responsibilities begin and end when it comes to AI security. The traditional vendor-customer relationship becomes more complex with AI systems, as data flows, model training, and inference processes create new types of interactions and dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Risk assessment evolution</strong></p>\n<p>Traditional security risk models struggle to capture the unique characteristics of AI systems. Security leaders are finding that standard risk assessment frameworks don't adequately address AI-specific risks. AI security risks will differ based on AI implementation and the context in which it’s used. The challenge is compounded by the need to evaluate AI vendors without necessarily having deep technical AI expertise on the security team.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Data protection complexities</strong><br />\nAI systems present unique challenges for data protection. The way these systems process, learn from, and generate data creates new privacy and security considerations that organizations should carefully evaluate. CISOs must ensure their data governance frameworks evolve to address how AI systems use and protect sensitive information. AI implementations with inadequate safeguards might inadvertently reveal protected information via AI generated outputs.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Compliance and standards navigation</strong><br />\nThe regulatory landscape for AI security is rapidly evolving, with new standards like ISO 42001 and others emerging alongside existing frameworks. Security leaders must navigate this complex environment while ensuring their AI implementations remain compliant with both current and anticipated regulations. This requires a delicate balance between enabling AI adoption and maintaining robust security controls that satisfy regulatory requirements.</p>\n<h2>Addressing these challenges</h2>\n<p>With the release of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>, we recognized these executive-level concerns and developed a comprehensive framework to help organizations navigate AI security in the context of our AI-powered DevSecOps platform. Our AI Security Framework provides details on our privacy-first implementation of AI to enable GitLab Duo, and how we validate the security of our AI vendors. A responsibility matrix is included to help security leaders manage their AI security responsibilities while enabling their organizations to innovate safely. We also compiled a selection of AI-specific security risks to keep in mind and highlighted how GitLab capabilities like <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/30/how-gitlab-uses-prompt-guardrails-to-help-protect-customers/\">prompt guardrails</a> can help in mitigating them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want a deeper look at our security controls?

This file tells GitLab how to build and deploy your site.</p>\n<p>Let's break down what each part does:</p>\n<p><strong>The script part</strong></p>\n<pre><code>script:\n  - mkdir .public\n  - cp -r * .public\n  - mv .public public\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a folder called <code>public</code> and copies all your website files into it. GitLab Pages uses this folder to serve your website by default, though you can <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/introduction/#customize-the-default-folder\">customize the publishing folder</a> if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>The only part</strong></p>\n<pre><code>only:\n  - main\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells GitLab to only update your website when changes are made to the main branch. This helps prevent accidental updates from experimental changes.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Watch the magic happen</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Commit all your changes.</li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Build &gt; Pipelines</strong> to watch your deployment.</li>\n<li>Wait for the pipeline to complete successfully (indicated by a green checkmark).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Pages tutorial - pipeline running for new page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3TWqK19gKq5HvjlEtRqHv5/dd79b1909720c1f923ba7eb48433da18/image6.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Pages tutorial - pipeline passed for new page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/45Ue4IruelSnpSAVomoaxk/411fe710e2d8c4c190d3edaa6df45ee6/image1.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Step 5: Access your website</h2>\n<p>Once the pipeline completes successfully, your website will be available at: <strong>https://[yourusername].gitlab.io/</strong> .</p>\n<p>You can find an overview of your deployed website and additional settings in your project's <strong>Deploy &gt; Pages</strong> section.

      "summary": "<p>Hatch is DigitalOcean’s global program for startups, which provides startups with credits and discounts on computing resources so they can build and scale without worrying about costs. In 2024, Hatch significantly revamped the program to better support those building businesses in the artificial intelligence sector, providing AI/ML startups with discounts for <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets\">GPU Droplets</a> and free access to DigitalOcean’s premium support in addition to credits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://exh.ai/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ex-human</a>, a startup building empathetic generative AI solutions backed by A16Z GAMES’ SPEEDRUN accelerator, chose the Hatch program to help serve their customers with AI models—read on to hear about their experience with Hatch so far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"from-film-to-the-future\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#from-film-to-the-future\">From film to the future</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#from-film-to-the-future\"></a></h2>\n<p>Inspired by the characters Sam from <em>Her (2013)</em> and Joi from <em>Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</em>, Artem Rodichev, founder and CEO of Ex-human, sought to build a future where humans interact with digital humans and characters on a daily basis, taking the form of friends, mentors, lovers, and more. After a stint at Replika, Rodichev saw that humans were building deeper connections with their AI companions and wanted to create a solution that was both viable for consumers and businesses.</p>\n<p>Ex-human brings their AI characters to life through text, images, video, and audio with unlimited scalability and customizability that opens up possibilities for numerous use cases. Partnering with companies such as Grindr, who are using Ex-human’s technology to bring an AI wingman to life, this technology has the opportunity to help humans form stronger bonds in both physical and digital worlds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\">Innovation shouldn’t come at a high cost</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\"></a></h2>\n<p>Building AI technology requires large amounts of computing power, which can come at a high price, especially for a new business. Ex-human chose the Hatch program because it offers exclusive pricing for access to on-demand NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplets at <strong>$1.90/GPU/hour</strong>*. Despite the favorable cost, Ex-human finds that there are no tradeoffs with power and reliability, giving them a solution that works for their budget and delivers for their needs. Ex-human uses GPU Droplets to serve their LLMs so customers can take advantage of their technology’s power.</p>\n<p>“DigitalOcean’s GPU Droplets are great. 99% of the time, it [is] used for serving our LLMs. I don’t think we have any trouble with unavailability, network issues, or stuff like that with DigitalOcean. We found DigitalOcean to be more intuitive and simpler than working with AWS or Google Cloud. It’s simple, not expensive, and reliable.” – Artem Rodichev, Founder and CEO @ Ex-human</p>\n<p>GPU Droplets allow for users to build, train, and scale their AI/ML workloads with ease. Through the Hatch program, you can access vast amounts of computational power without having to break the bank.</p>\n<p>Hatch startups also receive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Up to $100,000 in compute credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three months free of one NVIDIA H100x8 GPU Droplet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complimentary premium support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GenAI usage with Hatch credits</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Note that GPU Droplet usage will not be covered by Hatch compute credits. This pricing is only eligible for startups who are a part of the Hatch program, only applies to on-demand NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplets, and is accurate as of 3/7/2025. Pricing is subject to change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"musings-from-the-founder\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#musings-from-the-founder\">Musings from the founder</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#musings-from-the-founder\"></a></h2>\n<p>As a founder, Rodichev uses his deep expertise in AI/ML to guide Ex-human’s business and vision. While leading product development, he works alongside a talented team handling engineering, marketing, sales, investor relations, and everything in between. It’s hard work, but it’s deeply rewarding.</p>\n<p>Rodichev: “My number one advice–don’t start a startup. [laughs] The number two advice–do it if that’s the only thing you can do. If you really have a chip on your shoulder, if you really want to change the world in a way that you see how the world will develop, if you really want to build this kind of feature and no one else can build it, go start a startup.”</p>\n<p>The simplicity and reliability of DigitalOcean’s products affords founders like Rodichev to focus on things outside of managing their product’s infrastructure so they can build the future at full speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in joining the Hatch program to grow your startup?

      "summary": "<p>Growing businesses need networking solutions that are simple, scalable, and reliable. Whether you’re managing high-traffic applications, optimizing cloud resources, or strengthening security, our latest networking updates are designed to make your cloud infrastructure more powerful and easier to manage. Today, we’re excited to announce three key networking enhancements: <strong>Network Load Balancer</strong>, <strong>IPv6 for Load Balancers</strong>, and <strong>Reserved IPv6 for Droplets</strong>. Let’s dive into how these updates can help you distribute traffic efficiently, ensure stability across deployments, and future-proof your networking stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"network-load-balancer-smarter-traffic-distribution-for-high-performance-apps\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#network-load-balancer-smarter-traffic-distribution-for-high-performance-apps\">Network Load Balancer: Smarter traffic distribution for high-performance apps</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#network-load-balancer-smarter-traffic-distribution-for-high-performance-apps\"></a></h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"Network Load Balancer\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/NLB-new.gif\" /><figcaption>Network Load Balancer</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When your application experiences a surge in users, every millisecond counts. Our new <strong>Network Load Balancer,</strong> now in public preview, is designed to handle high-traffic volumes with greater efficiency and resilience. Unlike our existing load balancer, which operates at the application layer (Layer 7), the Network Load Balancer works at the transport layer (Layer 4). This means lower latency, higher throughput, unmetered total number of connections, and better handling of real-time workloads like gaming, streaming, and chat applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Key benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ultra-low latency:</strong> Directs traffic at the IP/protocol level for faster response times.</li>\n<li><strong>Scalable volume management:</strong> Handles high request volumes with minimal overhead.</li>\n<li><strong>Unmetered connections:</strong> Handles up to  millions of connections and requests per second</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a simple setup and automatic failover, Network Load Balancer helps ensure your application stays responsive—even when traffic spikes unexpectedly</p>\n<h2 id=\"ipv6-support-for-internet-facing-regional-load-balancers-delivering-dependable-performance\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ipv6-support-for-internet-facing-regional-load-balancers-delivering-dependable-performance\">IPv6 support for internet-facing regional Load Balancers: Delivering dependable performance</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ipv6-support-for-internet-facing-regional-load-balancers-delivering-dependable-performance\"></a></h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"IPv6 for load balancers\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/lb-v6-new-2.gif\" /><figcaption>IPv6 for load balancers</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can now support IPv6 client connections by assigning IPv6 addresses to your internet-facing load balancers, and even dual-stack your external-facing regional load balancer that gets both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Any addresses you assign will persist throughout the lifetime of the load balancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IPv4 depletion:</strong> Less to worry about running out of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 support offers a larger address space than IPv4.</li>\n<li><strong>IPv6 client support:</strong> Dual stack your load balancers and support IPv6 clients without modifying your application stack.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global accessibility:</strong> IPv6 is designed to  support growth for businesses scaling internationally or with large distributed workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"reserved-ipv6-for-droplets-build-a-scalable-and-resilient-infrastructure\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#reserved-ipv6-for-droplets-build-a-scalable-and-resilient-infrastructure\">Reserved IPv6 for Droplets: Build a scalable and resilient infrastructure</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#reserved-ipv6-for-droplets-build-a-scalable-and-resilient-infrastructure\"></a></h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"Reserved IPv6 for Droplets\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Reserved-IP.gif\" /><figcaption>Reserved IPv6 for Droplets</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For developers building scalable cloud environments, managing IP addresses should be effortless. With <strong>Reserved IPv6 for Droplets</strong>, now available for public preview, you can reserve, assign, unassign, and reassign IPv6 addresses across different Droplets or to a specific data center. Whether you’re migrating workloads, deploying blue-green updates, or ensuring continuity after scaling events, Reserved IPv6 gives you the flexibility to manage your network more efficiently.This feature is perfect for teams that need predictable networking while keeping infrastructure simple and cost-effective.</p>\n<p><strong>How it helps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IP persistence:</strong> Retain IP addresses when upgrading or replacing Droplets.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved service continuity:</strong> Avoid disruptions during maintenance or scaling.</li>\n<li><strong>More control over your network:</strong> Assign IPv6 addresses based on workload needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"get-started-with-better-networking-today\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started-with-better-networking-today\">Get started with better networking today</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started-with-better-networking-today\"></a></h2>\n<p>These networking enhancements are now available to help you scale with confidence.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"introduction\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#introduction\"></a></h2>\n<p>Currents is DigitalOcean’s report on trends impacting developers at growing tech businesses around the world. For our latest edition, we focused on how these growing businesses are adapting to the increased adoption of artificial intelligence. The rise of AI has created opportunities for individual developers and businesses, but integrating new tools and technologies is not without challenges, especially for those who are not large enterprises with teams dedicated to AI. This report, gathered responses from over 1,000 developers around the world, examines how widespread adoption of AI really is, what challenges developers face when it comes to AI adoption, how usage of AI tools differs based on company size and other factors, and what the biggest upcoming trends are.</p>\n<p>The findings reveal a significant growth opportunity, as 21% of organizations have yet to implement AI formally in any form. Despite this, there is clear interest in AI innovation: 66% of respondents are engaged in passion projects exploring AI, and 36% are actively investigating capabilities without having launched formal initiatives. For small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular, AI adoption could be a game-changer by allowing developers to take on multiple roles more easily—but they must first overcome key barriers, such as high Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) costs and lack of internal knowledge on how to best leverage these tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-findings\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#key-findings\">Key findings:</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#key-findings\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"ai-adoption-is-increasing-but-still-has-growth-potential\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-adoption-is-increasing-but-still-has-growth-potential\">AI adoption is increasing, but still has growth potential</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-adoption-is-increasing-but-still-has-growth-potential\"></a></h3>\n<p>AI adoption has increased significantly over the past year—in November 2023, we found that 49% of respondents had used AI for business use, and a year later, 79% say their organization is integrating AI in some form. However, there is still clear room for more growth and maturity in organizations’ AI usage, as 32% say they are just starting to explore AI, and just 11% consider themselves an AI-driven business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cost-and-knowledge-are-barriers-for-entry-for-smes\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#cost-and-knowledge-are-barriers-for-entry-for-smes\">Cost and knowledge are barriers for entry for SMEs</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#cost-and-knowledge-are-barriers-for-entry-for-smes\"></a></h3>\n<p>The high upfront costs of GPUs are a challenge for 34% of businesses, along with the lack of knowledge around how to optimize GPUs. Smaller companies feel this more acutely, and sometimes struggle to justify investments in AI as they find it challenging to demonstrate a clear return on investment from these activities, and have a lack of dedicated in-house AI resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust-safety-and-integration-concerns\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#trust-safety-and-integration-concerns\">Trust, safety, and integration concerns</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#trust-safety-and-integration-concerns\"></a></h3>\n<p>Other challenges with adoption for AI include integrating AI into existing workflows and choosing the right AI model. Looking at the most urgent issues in the AI space today, 47% say reliance on unverified LLM data is a top concern, along with ensuring AI data is unbiased.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upcoming-trends-in-ai\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#upcoming-trends-in-ai\">Upcoming trends in AI</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#upcoming-trends-in-ai\"></a></h3>\n<p>While areas such as agentic AI are already growing quickly, we looked at what respondents feel is the next frontier of AI, and found that Advanced Multi Modal Systems, Real Time Audio Translation, and Automated Machine Learning are the next most compelling. Organizations currently are primarily using AI for improving internal processes and operations and enhancing their existing services with AI/ML.</p>\n<h2 id=\"read-the-report\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#read-the-report\">Read the report</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#read-the-report\"></a></h2>\n<p>These findings make it clear—accessible AI solutions are key to unlocking AI for businesses of all sizes, especially those without large teams dedicated to AI transformation. Affordable GPU compute and approachable AI tools will help alleviate the challenges many developers are currently facing when it comes to AI, and enable them to integrate AI solutions more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/currents/february-2025\">Currents webpage for the full report and graphs</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sign up</a> to explore DigitalOcean’s Generative AI platform and GPU offerings.</p>",

We see opportunities for better performance and ease of use by only deprecating those configurations, setting smarter defaults and encouraging more best practices.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 sets the stage for us to bring the next generation of features along with performance and scalability improvements the community hungers for.</p><p>This release will improve UX, security and performance by:</p><ol><li>Introducing additional recommended configurations out of the box, thus reducing required effort to achieve more secure and performant Argo CD configurations</li><li>Dropping support for legacy configuration options, that we discourage using</li></ol><p>With time and community feedback, we realized that certain <em>optional</em> configurations should in fact be the <em>default</em>, since many users explicitly configure those. One such example would be some performance-related configurations.</p><p>This release will also address long-existing technical debt, caused by supporting legacy configurations we started with when Argo CD was young, and which we no longer recommend on using, as Argo CD had matured.</p><h3><strong>What Is Changing in This Version?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/milestone/27?closed=1\">Here</a> is a non-exhaustive list of changes in this release, among those:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19768\">Removal</a> of support for legacy argocd-cm repository config</li><li>Enabling fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19988\">by default</a></li><li>Making applyNestedSelectors: true the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/14152\">default and only</a> option for matrix/merge generators</li><li>Having an <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">opinion</a> on secrets — while we remained un-opinionated regarding secret management with Argo CD since day 1, maintainability and security lessons learned surfaced the need to be better aligned with the industry in this domain</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21207\">Preventing</a> the usage of in-cluster, when in-cluster is explicitly disabled</li></ol><h3>Backwards Compatibility &amp; Migration</h3><p>We aim for v3 release to be so inoffensive, that upgrading to 3.0 is almost as easy as upgrading between 2.x minor versions has been.</p><p>For each change, the documentation will contain clear description of:</p><ol><li>What the change is</li><li>How to determine whether the user is affected by the change (i.e which command to run)</li><li>How to migrate</li><li>For relatively high-risk changes - how to opt out (i.e switch back to the old default)</li></ol><h3>Get Involved</h3><p>You can read the full proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21422\">here</a>.

This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

      "summary": "<h3><strong>Argo CD v2.14</strong></h3><p>We are thrilled to announce the release of Argo CD 2.14, packed with new features, bug fixes, and documentation updates to enhance your experience.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in Argo CD 2.14. As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

This feature allows you to group information from multiple places (for example a public Helm chart plus your local values file) to form a single Argo CD application. Initial support for defining multiple sources was already added in Argo CD version 2.6, and the support for CLI was added in 2.11. The UI still assumed the application to have a single source and certain CLI features like rollback were not yet supported for an application with multiple sources.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, rollback of a multiple source application is now possible via both Argo CD UI and CLI.</p><p>In addition to the rollback feature, a new Sources tab has been added to the Application Details page, enabling users to manage (view and edit) the sources of an application.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mj0F_f8U8TQMhzvN\" /></figure><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/keithchong\">Keith Chong</a> (Red Hat) and <a href=\"https://github.com/JorTurFer\">Jorge Turrado</a> for implementing these features.</p><h3>Project Scoped Repository Credential Improvements</h3><p>Currently, multiple repository credentials sharing the same URL is not allowed by the Argo CD API. If the credentials are added directly to the argocd namespace, argocd-server won’t return an error, but this still does not work since the first secret that matches a repository URL is the one that gets returned, and the order is also undefined.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, Argo CD will allow multiple app projects to have the ability to have separate repository credentials having the same URL.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">Blake Pettersson</a> (Akuity) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Add labels for Kubernetes events</h3><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, users will be able to expose application labels on k8s events generated by Argo CD. When the events are created for Applications that have specific label keys defined in `resource.includeEventLabelKeys`, the controller will attach the matching labels to the events. This connection will make it simpler to filter or process the events based on the applications using these labels.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/svghadi\">Siddhesh Ghadi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Consistent Sharding Algorithm</h3><p>Argo CD provides the capability to employ sharding for different Argo CD application controllers. This allows you to assign specific clusters to specific controllers to distribute the load across the different shards.</p><p>The existing sharding algorithms, including the legacy method and the round-robin algorithm, have shown limitations in maintaining optimal load distribution and minimizing unnecessary cluster-to-shard assignment changes.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, a new sharding algorithm named “consistent-hashing” is introduced which reduces Cluster-to-Shard Assignment Changes and optimizes resource utilization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/akram\">Akram Ben Aissi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p>Here are some other new changes that made it into the release</p><ul><li>Updates to git client for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17566\">resolving semantic versioning tags</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/thepabloaguilar\">Pablo Aguilar</a> from Stone Payments)</li><li>Application Set Git Generator now supports <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18545\">GPG signature verification</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/ishitasequeira\">Ishita Sequeira</a> from Red Hat)</li><li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18250\">ls-remote request fail</a> metric (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>)</li><li>Add new<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/pull/560\"> annotation argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Force=true</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/kkk777-7\">Kota Kimura</a> from CyberAgent, Inc.)</li><li>Add support for setting a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17728\">grpc message size as an environment variable</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pavel Kostohrys</a> from Codefresh)</li><li>Display the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18116\">list of dependent resources</a> in the delete popup (by <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a> from Intuit)</li><li>Remove support for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/13203\">old tracking label</a> <em>applications.argoproj.io/app-name</em> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">Soumya Ghosh Dastidar</a> from Akuity)</li><li>Add support for<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18484\"> fish shell completion</a> to Argo CD CLI (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Sn0rt\">Sn0rt</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18657\">Skip calling git fetch</a> if the commit to checkout exists locally (by <a href=\"https://github.com/shady-canva\">Shady Rafehi</a>)</li></ul><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.12.0-rc1\">release notes</a>, and <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.11-2.12/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo Image Updater — 0.13</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo Image updater. The project also has new maintainers. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8sA04KzvtmWpk0AWGJ3-nw.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo Image updater is a companion controller to Argo CD. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifests</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.13.0\">release </a>includes 5 new features, 12 fixes and several documentation updates. Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source applications</h3><p>Using <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multiple sources</a> in an Argo CD application was one of the most requested feature by Helm users. Multi source applications allow you to define an external Helm chart from a Helm repository while still referencing your own local values from a Git repository.</p><p>With this new release Argo Image updater now supports <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-target\">updating images in values</a> of multi-source applications. This feature will be very useful for teams that use off-the-self Helm charts in conjunction with Argo image updater</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/askhari\">David Vidal Villamide</a> (Virtual Cave S.L.) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Specify write-back Git repository as annotation</h3><p>A very common scenario for Helm users is the usage of Image updater for Helm charts that are stored in a Helm repository and not in Git. Simply monitoring the Helm chart for new versions works fine, but using the write-back feature of Image updater would fail, as Image updater didn’t understand that the Helm start is not stored in Git.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-LQDZILw4Rk5Un4qHfY6Ow.png\" /></figure><p>Now there is a <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/update-methods/#specifying-a-repository-when-using-a-helm-repository-in-repourl\">new annotation argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/git-repository</a> where you can define explicitly what Git repository will be used for the write-back feature. This is very powerful as not only solves the issue with Helm charts outside of Git, but allows you to decouple the Git repository of the manifests with the Git repository for the write-back action.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/flozzone\">Florin Hillebrand</a> (Anyline) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Respect original parameter overrides during Git write-back</h3><p>Yet another important feature in the case of writing back parameter overrides is respecting the existing ones. Previously if a user had custom Image updater values in the .argocd-source.yaml those would be lost on the next write-back action.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/851/1*tS21V3CEjaC3xMp8oArtOQ.png\" /></figure><p>With this new release Argo Image updater behaves in the expected way and keeps all the existing overrides before adding the new ones. Thus a single file now contains both user defined values and the ones from Image updater.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ks-yim\">KS. Yim</a> (Line Engineering) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Added support for separate GitHub credentials</h3><p>If you want to use Argo Image updater with Github you now have an additional way of specifying the Git credentials. In addition to using username/password you can now also use <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/update-methods/#specifying-git-credentials\">GitHub app credentials</a></p><p>For more information about this type of authentication see the<a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/about-authentication-with-a-github-app\"> official documentation at GitHub</a>.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/dlactin\">Dustin Lactin</a> (Mozilla) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Renamed confusing update strategies</h3><p>Argo Image updater has several <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/update-strategies/\">different strategies for monitoring</a> container images and deciding if a new version is considered “new” or not.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/761/1*dj2-cDBV6P9YwOOGy87irg.png\" /></figure><p>The strategy “latest” is now renamed to “newest-build” which explains better the intent as “latest” is already an overloaded term in the Kubernetes world.</p><p>The strategy “name’ is now renamed to “alphabetical” which again makes it clear how it works. Note that at the time of writing the previous names continue to work, but you are encouraged to upgrade to the new names as in the future they will be the only ones that will be valid.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jaideepr97\">Jaideep Rao</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>This release of Argo Image updater was led by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Argo maintainer Pasha</a> from Codefresh (now part of Octopus Deploy).</p><p>What does this mean for the future of Argo Image Updater?</p><p>In the coming months we will work to improve the release process so that we can support more frequent releases. We will also be incorporating features submitted by the community. Finally we will review pull requests on a best-effort basis.</p><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release or you are interested in becoming a maintainer, please contact us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.</p><p>Happy deployments!</p><p>Photo by<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@pawelj?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"> Pawel Janiak</a> on<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-wearing-black-jacket-sitting-on-gray-rock-and-using-binoculrs-dxFi8Ea670E?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"> Unsplash</a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1fa3ef11996f\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">New Release for Argo Image Updater — 0.13</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

for ambient mode</h3>\n<p>Istio will generally route traffic based on HTTP headers. In ambient mode, the ztunnel only sees traffic at Layer 4, and does not have access to HTTP headers. Therefore, DNS proxying is required to enable resolution of <code>ServiceEntry</code> addresses, especially in the case of <a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Troubleshooting-Istio-Ambient#scenario-ztunnel-is-not-sending-egress-traffic-to-waypoints\">sending egress traffic to waypoints</a>.</p>\n<p>To make this easier in the default case, DNS proxying is enabled by default in ambient mode installations of Istio 1.25.  An annotation has been added to allow workloads to opt out of DNS proxying. Check the <a href=\"https://istio.io/news/releases/1.25.x/announcing-1.25/upgrade-notes/#ambient-mode-dns-capture-on-by-default\">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"default-deny-policy-available-for-waypoints\">Default deny policy available for waypoints</h3>\n<p>In sidecar mode, authorization policy is attached to workloads via a selector. In ambient mode, policy targeted by selector is enforced by ztunnel only. Waypoint proxies use Gateway API-style binding using the <code>targetRef</code> field. This led to a potential configuration where a workload was default-denied the ability to talk to an endpoint, but could bypass that configuration by connecting to a waypoint that <em>was</em> allowed to talk to that endpoint, and thus reach it anyway.</p>\n<p>In this release, we have added the ability to target policy to a named <code>GatewayClass</code>, as well as a named <code>Gateway</code>. This allows you to set policy on the <code>istio-waypoint</code> class, which apply to all instances of a waypoint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zonal-routing-enhancements\">Zonal routing enhancements</h3>\n<p>Whether for reliability, performance, or cost reasons, controlling cross-zone and cross-region traffic is often an important &ldquo;day 2&rdquo; operation for users. With Istio 1.25, this just got even easier!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#traffic-distribution\">Kubernetes&rsquo;s traffic distribution</a> feature is now fully supported, offering a simplified interface to keep traffic local. The existing Istio <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/locality-load-balancing/\">locality load balancing</a> settings remain available for more complex use cases.</p>\n<p>In ambient mode, ztunnel will now report the additional <code>source_zone</code>, <code>source_region</code>, <code>destination_zone</code>, and <code>destination_region</code> labels to all metrics, giving a clear view of cross-zonal traffic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-new-features\">Other new features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We have added the ability to provide a list of virtual interfaces whose inbound traffic will be unconditionally treated as outbound. This allows workloads using virtual networking (KubeVirt, VMs, docker-in-docker, etc) to function correctly with both sidecar and ambient mode traffic capture.</li>\n<li>The <code>istio-cni</code> DaemonSet can now be safely upgraded in-place in an active cluster, without requiring a node cordon to prevent pods spawned during the upgrade process from escaping ambient traffic capture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://istio.io/news/releases/1.25.x/announcing-1.25/change-notes/\">the full change notes</a> for everything else that is new.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-125\">Upgrading to 1.25</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.25.

This is off by default as of 1.25.0, but will eventually be enabled by default. This feature can be enabled by <code>helm install cni --set ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code> (Helm) or <code>istioctl install --set values.cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code> (istioctl).</p>\n<h2 id=\"dns-traffic-tcp-and-udp-now-respects-traffic-exclusion-annotations\">DNS traffic (TCP and UDP) now respects traffic exclusion annotations</h2>\n<p>DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) now respects pod-level traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. This behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ambient-mode-dns-capture-on-by-default\">Ambient mode DNS capture on by default</h2>\n<p>DNS proxying is enabled by default for ambient mode workloads in this release. Note that only new pods will have DNS enabled: existing pods will not have their DNS traffic captured. To enable this feature for existing pods, they must either be manually restarted, or alternatively the iptables reconciliation feature can be enabled when upgrading <code>istio-cni</code> via <code>--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code>. This will reconcile existing pods automatically on upgrade.</p>\n<p>Individual pods may opt-out of global ambient mode DNS capture by applying the<code>ambient.istio.io/dns-capture=false</code> annotation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grafana-dashboard-changes\">Grafana dashboard changes</h2>\n<p>The dashboards shipped with Istio 1.25 require version 7.2 or later of Grafana.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opencensus-support-has-been-removed\">OpenCensus support has been removed</h2>\n<p>Because Envoy has <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.33/v1.33.0.html#incompatible-behavior-changes\">removed the OpenCensus tracing extension</a>, we have\nremoved OpenCensus support from Istio. If you are using OpenCensus, you should migrate to OpenTelemetry.  <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2023/sunsetting-opencensus/\">Learn more about the deprecation of OpenCensus</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ztunnel-helm-chart-changes\">ztunnel Helm chart changes</h2>\n<p>In previous releases, resources in the ztunnel Helm chart were always named <code>ztunnel</code>.\nIn this release, they are now named <code>.Resource.Name</code>.</p>\n<p>If you are installing the chart with a release name other than <code>ztunnel</code>, the resource names will change, triggering downtime.\nIn this scenario, it is recommended to set <code>--set resourceName=ztunnel</code> to override back to the previous default.</p>",

\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"changes\">Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug with mixed-case Hosts in Gateway and TLS redirect resulted in stale RDS.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49638\">Issue #49638</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Ambient <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policies were overly strict.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53884\">Issue #53884</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> failure to patch managed gateway/waypoint deployments during upgrade to 1.24.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54145\">Issue #54145</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in where multiple STRICT port-level mTLS rules in an ambient mode PeerAuthentication policy would effectively result\nin a permissive policy due to incorrect evaluation logic (AND vs. OR).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54146\">Issue #54146</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the wording of the status message when L7 rules are present in an AuthorizationPolicy which is bound to ztunnel, to be clearer.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54334\">Issue #54334</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the request mirror filter incorrectly computed the percentage.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54357\">Issue #54357</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where using a tag in the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label on a gateway caused the gateway to be improperly programmed, and to lack status.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54458\">Issue #54458</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where out-of-order ztunnel disconnects could put <code>istio-cni</code> in a state where it believes it has no connections.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54544\">Issue #54544</a>),(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53843\">Issue #53843</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access log order caused instability during connection draining.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54672\">Issue #54672</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the gateway chart where <code>--set platform</code> worked but <code>--set global.platform</code> did not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient mode destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the <code>istio-iptables</code> command to fail when a non-built-in table is present in the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing configuration to be rejected when there is a partial overlap between IP addresses across multiple services.\nFor example, a Service with <code>[IP-A]</code> and one with <code>[IP-B, IP-A]</code>.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52847\">Issue #52847</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

<code>istio-cni-node</code> DaemonSet. This fixes issues when running in environments\nwhere certain files are owned by non-root users.\nNote: prior to Istio 1.24, the <code>istio-cni-node</code> ran as <code>privileged</code>. Istio 1.24 removed this, but removed some required\nprivileges which are now added back. Relatively to Istio 1.23, <code>istio-cni-node</code> still has fewer privileges than it does\nwith this change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> Helm rendering to properly apply annotations on Pilot&rsquo;s <code>ServiceAccount</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51289\">Issue #51289</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istiod</code> did not handle <code>RequestAuthentication</code> correctly for cross-namespace waypoint proxies.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54051\">Issue #54051</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where non-default revisions controlled gateways lacked <code>istio.io/rev</code> labels.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54280\">Issue #54280</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>ExternalName</code> services failed to resolve when using ambient mode and DNS proxying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue preventing the <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code> <code>maxUnavailable</code> field from being configured.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54087\">Issue #54087</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where injection config errors were being silenced (i.e. logged and not returned) when the sidecar injector was unable to process the sidecar config. This change will now propagate the error to the user instead of continuing to process a faulty config.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53357\">Issue #53357</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-early-days\">The early days<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-early-days\" name=\"the-early-days\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yace-gains-momentum\">Yace Gains Momentum<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#yace-gains-momentum\" name=\"yace-gains-momentum\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\">Gratitude and Future Vision<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#gratitude-and-future-vision\" name=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success.

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time, \nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to \ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-new\">What's New<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-new\" name=\"whats-new\"></a>\n</h1>\n<div class=\"toc toc-right\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\">New UI\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\">OTLP Support\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\">Native Histograms\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes\n</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-ui\">New UI<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\" name=\"new-ui\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please \n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\" name=\"remote-write-2-0\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. \nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\" name=\"utf-8-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"otlp-support\">OTLP Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\" name=\"otlp-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features \nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\" name=\"otlp-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\" name=\"utf-8-normalization\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:%7E:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"native-histograms\">Native Histograms<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\" name=\"native-histograms\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\" name=\"breaking-changes\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"performance\">Performance<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#performance\" name=\"performance\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a> \nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-next\">What's Next<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-next\" name=\"whats-next\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and… \nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong>\n</li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"try-it-out\">Try It Out!<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#try-it-out\" name=\"try-it-out\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"looking-back-at-2023\">Looking back at 2023<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#looking-back-at-2023\" name=\"looking-back-at-2023\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-year-ahead\">The year ahead<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-year-ahead\" name=\"the-year-ahead\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\">OTLP Ingestion GA<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion-ga\" name=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\">Support UTF-8 metric and label names<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\" name=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\">Native support for resource attributes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-support-for-resource-attributes\" name=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes.

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\">History of the Forwarding Use Case<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\" name=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (: </p>\n\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"remote-write\">Remote Write<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write\" name=\"remote-write\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"prometheus-agent-mode\">Prometheus Agent Mode<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#prometheus-agent-mode\" name=\"prometheus-agent-mode\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\">The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\" name=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\">Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\" name=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\">How to Use Agent Mode in Detail<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\" name=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">usage: prometheus [&lt;flags&gt;]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#summary\" name=\"summary\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"preamble\">Preamble<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#preamble\" name=\"preamble\"></a>\n</h1>\n<div class=\"toc toc-right\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-categories\">New Categories\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#call-for-action\">Call for Action\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#register-for-being-tested\">Register for being tested\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#full-prometheus-compatibility\">Full Prometheus Compatibility\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#projects\">Projects\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#aas\">aaS\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#agent-collector\">Agent/Collector\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#passing\">Passing\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#not-passing\">Not passing\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</ul></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-categories\">New Categories<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-categories\" name=\"new-categories\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"call-for-action\">Call for Action<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#call-for-action\" name=\"call-for-action\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"register-for-being-tested\">Register for being tested<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#register-for-being-tested\" name=\"register-for-being-tested\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested.

As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"projects\">Projects<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#projects\" name=\"projects\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"passing\">Passing<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#passing\" name=\"passing\"></a>\n</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"not-passing\">Not passing<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#not-passing\" name=\"not-passing\"></a>\n</h4>\n\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>.

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
