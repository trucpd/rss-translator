This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge-with-kubernetes-events\">The challenge with Kubernetes events</h2>\n<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute</li>\n<li><strong>Retention</strong>: Default event retention is limited to one hour</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Related events from different components are not automatically linked</li>\n<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Events lack standardized severity or category classifications</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: Similar events are not automatically grouped</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/\">Event</a> API reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-world-value\">Real-World value</h2>\n<p>Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional event aggregation process:</strong> Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>With its event aggregation in its custom events:</strong> The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours.</p>\n<p>The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-an-event-aggregation-system\">Building an Event aggregation system</h2>\n<p>This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I've picked the Go programming language for my example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-overview\">Architecture overview</h3>\n<p>This event aggregation system consists of three main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Event Watcher</strong>: Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events</li>\n<li><strong>Event Processor</strong>: Processes, categorizes, and correlates events</li>\n<li><strong>Storage Backend</strong>: Stores processed events for longer retention</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's a sketch for how to implement the event watcher:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #a2f;

      "summary": "<p>Modern generative AI and large language model (LLM) services create unique traffic-routing challenges\non Kubernetes. Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often\nlong-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server\nmay keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches.</p>\n<p>Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed\nfor these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e.g., interactive\nchat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach\nis missing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gateway-api-inference-extension\">Gateway API Inference Extension</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> was created to address\nthis gap by building on the existing <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API</a>, adding inference-specific\nrouting capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference\nextension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an <strong>Inference Gateway</strong>, enabling you to\nself-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset.</p>\n<p>The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key\nobjectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model\nroll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics. By achieving these, the project aims\nto reduce latency and improve accelerator (GPU) utilization for AI workloads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The design introduces two new Custom Resources (CRDs) with distinct responsibilities, each aligning with a\nspecific user persona in the AI/ML serving workflow​:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Resource Model\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-resource-model.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencepool/\">InferencePool</a>\nDefines a pool of pods (model servers) running on shared compute (e.g., GPU nodes). The platform admin can\nconfigure how these pods are deployed, scaled, and balanced. An InferencePool ensures consistent resource\nusage and enforces platform-wide policies. An InferencePool is similar to a Service but specialized for AI/ML\nserving needs and aware of the model-serving protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencemodel/\">InferenceModel</a>\nA user-facing model endpoint managed by AI/ML owners. It maps a public name (e.g., &quot;gpt-4-chat&quot;) to the actual\nmodel within an InferencePool. This lets workload owners specify which models (and optional fine-tuning) they\nwant served, plus a traffic-splitting or prioritization policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the InferenceModel API lets AI/ML owners manage what is served, while the InferencePool lets platform\noperators manage where and how it’s served.</p>\n<h2 id=\"request-flow\">Request flow</h2>\n<p>The flow of a request builds on the Gateway API model (Gateways and HTTPRoutes) with one or more extra inference-aware\nsteps (extensions) in the middle. Here’s a high-level example of the request flow with the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/#endpoint-selection-extension\">Endpoint Selection Extension (ESE)</a>:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Request Flow\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-request-flow.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gateway Routing</strong><br />\nA client sends a request (e.g., an HTTP POST to /completions). The Gateway (like Envoy) examines the HTTPRoute\nand identifies the matching InferencePool backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Endpoint Selection</strong><br />\nInstead of simply forwarding to any available pod, the Gateway consults an inference-specific routing extension—\nthe Endpoint Selection Extension—to pick the best of the available pods. This extension examines live pod metrics\n(queue lengths, memory usage, loaded adapters) to choose the ideal pod for the request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inference-Aware Scheduling</strong><br />\nThe chosen pod is the one that can handle the request with the lowest latency or highest efficiency, given the\nuser’s criticality or resource needs. The Gateway then forwards traffic to that specific pod.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Endpoint Extension Scheduling\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-epp-scheduling.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>This extra step provides a smarter, model-aware routing mechanism that still feels like a normal single request to\nthe client. Additionally, the design is extensible—any Inference Gateway can be enhanced with additional inference-specific\nextensions to handle new routing strategies, advanced scheduling logic, or specialized hardware needs. As the project\ncontinues to grow, contributors are encouraged to develop new extensions that are fully compatible with the same underlying\nGateway API model, further expanding the possibilities for efficient and intelligent GenAI/LLM routing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benchmarks\">Benchmarks</h2>\n<p>We evaluated ​this extension against a standard Kubernetes Service for a <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/\">vLLM</a>‐based model\nserving deployment. The test environment consisted of multiple H100 (80 GB) GPU pods running vLLM (<a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/01/27/v1-alpha-release.html\">version 1</a>)\non a Kubernetes cluster, with 10 Llama2 model replicas. The <a href=\"https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/inference-benchmark\">Latency Profile Generator (LPG)</a>\ntool was used to generate traffic and measure throughput, latency, and other metrics. The\n<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json\">ShareGPT</a>\ndataset served as the workload, and traffic was ramped from 100 Queries per Second (QPS) up to 1000 QPS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-results\">Key results</h3>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Endpoint Extension Scheduling\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-benchmark.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Comparable Throughput</strong>: Throughout the tested QPS range, the ESE delivered throughput roughly on par with a standard\nKubernetes Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lower Latency</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Per‐Output‐Token Latency</strong>: The ​ESE showed significantly lower p90 latency at higher QPS (500+), indicating that\nits model-aware routing decisions reduce queueing and resource contention as GPU memory approaches saturation.</li>\n<li><strong>Overall p90 Latency</strong>: Similar trends emerged, with the ​ESE reducing end‐to‐end tail latencies compared to the\nbaseline, particularly as traffic increased beyond 400–500 QPS.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These results suggest that this extension's model‐aware routing significantly reduced latency for GPU‐backed LLM\nworkloads. By dynamically selecting the least‐loaded or best‐performing model server, it avoids hotspots that can\nappear when using traditional load balancing methods for large, long‐running inference requests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As the Gateway API Inference Extension heads toward GA, planned features include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prefix-cache aware load balancing</strong> for remote caches</li>\n<li><strong>LoRA adapter pipelines</strong> for automated rollout</li>\n<li><strong>Fairness and priority</strong> between workloads in the same criticality band</li>\n<li><strong>HPA support</strong> for scaling based on aggregate, per-model metrics</li>\n<li><strong>Support for large multi-modal inputs/outputs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Additional model types</strong> (e.g., diffusion models)</li>\n<li><strong>Heterogeneous accelerators</strong> (serving on multiple accelerator types with latency- and cost-aware load balancing)</li>\n<li><strong>Disaggregated serving</strong> for independently scaling pools</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>By aligning model serving with Kubernetes-native tooling, Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify\nand standardize how AI/ML traffic is routed. With model-aware routing, criticality-based prioritization, and\nmore, it helps ops teams deliver the right LLM services to the right users—smoothly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to learn more?</strong> Visit the <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">project docs</a> to dive deeper,\ngive an Inference Gateway extension a try with a few <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">simple steps</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/contributing/\">get involved</a> if you’re interested in\ncontributing to the project!</p>",

You can see that illustrated in the following example Pod manifest snippet:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">initContainers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>logshipper<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>alpine:latest<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">restartPolicy</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Always<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># this is what makes it a sidecar container</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">'sh'</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'-c'</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'tail -F /opt/logs.txt'</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">volumeMounts</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>data<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">mountPath</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>/opt<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>What are the specifics of defining sidecars with a <code>.spec.initContainers</code> block, rather than as a legacy multi-container pod with multiple <code>.spec.containers</code>?\nWell, all <code>.spec.initContainers</code> are always launched <strong>before</strong> the main application. If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there’s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It’s also actually how I’d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn’t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the “best practice” solution), but sometimes they can’t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let’s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I’ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

If you’re wondering why I’ve added it to my <code>initContainer</code>, let’s analyse what happens If I’d added it to myapp container. I wouldn’t have guaranteed the probe would run before the main application code - and this one, can potentially error out without the sidecar being up and running.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn’t affect readiness at all. After a while, the sidecar will begin to restart itself, but it won’t influence the main container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findings-summary\">Findings summary</h2>\n<p>I’ll summarize the startup behavior in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Probe/Hook</th>\n<th>Sidecar starts before the main app?</th>\n<th>Main app waits for the sidecar to be ready?</th>\n<th>What if the check doesn’t pass?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>readinessProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is not ready; main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>livenessProbe</code></td>\n<td>Yes, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is restarted, main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>startupProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>postStart</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, main app container starts after <code>postStart</code> completes</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but you have to provide custom logic for that</td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To summarize: with sidecars often being a dependency of the main application, you may want to delay the start of the latter until the sidecar is healthy.\nThe ideal pattern is to start both containers simultaneously and have the app container logic delay at all levels, but it’s not always possible. If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition. Thankfully, it’s nice and quick, and you have the recipe ready above.</p>\n<p>Happy deploying!</p>",

We are\nalso pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant\nimplementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog\nannouncement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on\nApril 24, 2025.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the <em>Standard</em> channel\n(Gateway API's GA release channel): <em>percentage-based request mirroring</em>, and\nintroduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\nfilters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry\nbudgets.</p>\n<p>Also see the full\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-CHANGELOG.md\">release notes</a>\nand applaud the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-TEAM.md\">v1.3.0 release team</a>\nnext time you see them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduation-to-standard-channel\">Graduation to Standard channel</h2>\n<p>Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API\nfeatures, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of\nconfidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility.\nOf course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue\nto evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network)\ncertainly expect\nfurther refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how\nall of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning Policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"percentage-based-request-mirroring\">Percentage-based request mirroring</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/LiorLieberman\">Lior Lieberman</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/jakebennert\">Jake Bennert</a></p>\n<p>GEP-3171: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-3171/index.md\">Percentage-Based Request Mirroring</a></p>\n<p><em>Percentage-based request mirroring</em> is an enhancement to the\nexisting support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-request-mirroring/\">HTTP request mirroring</a>, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the\nRequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot; being mirrored to &quot;foo-v2&quot;:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are\nchanged or removed later.</p>\n<p>Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel\nresources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the\nprefix &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;. For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/16/kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-beta/",
      "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the <strong>in-place Pod resize</strong> feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to <strong>Beta</strong> and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-place-pod-resize\">What is in-place Pod resize?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts.</p>\n<p>In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a <em>running</em> Pod, often without requiring a container restart.</p>\n<p>Here's the core idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>spec.containers[*].resources</code> field in a Pod specification now represents the <em>desired</em> resources and is mutable for CPU and memory.</li>\n<li>The <code>status.containerStatuses[*].resources</code> field reflects the <em>actual</em> resources currently configured on a running container.</li>\n<li>You can trigger a resize by updating the desired resources in the Pod spec via the new <code>resize</code> subresource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try it out on a v1.33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires <code>kubectl</code> v1.32+):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl edit pod &lt;pod-name&gt; --subresource resize\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation:\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-in-place-pod-resize-matter\">Why does in-place Pod resize matter?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Disruption:</strong> Stateful applications, long-running batch jobs, and sensitive workloads can have their resources adjusted without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a Pod restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Resource Utilization:</strong> Scale down over-provisioned Pods without disruption, freeing up resources in the cluster. Conversely, provide more resources to Pods under heavy load without needing a restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Scaling:</strong> Address transient resource needs more quickly. For example Java applications often need more CPU during startup than during steady-state operation. Start with higher CPU and resize down later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-changed-between-alpha-and-beta\">What's changed between Alpha and Beta?</h2>\n<p>Since the alpha release in v1.27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-user-facing-changes\">Notable user-facing changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>resize</code> Subresource:</strong> Modifying Pod resources must now be done via the Pod's <code>resize</code> subresource (<code>kubectl patch pod &lt;name&gt; --subresource resize ...</code>). <code>kubectl</code> versions v1.32+ support this argument.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize Status via Conditions:</strong> The old <code>status.resize</code> field is deprecated. The status of a resize operation is now exposed via two Pod conditions:\n<ul>\n<li><code>PodResizePending</code>: Indicates the Kubelet cannot grant the resize immediately (e.g., <code>reason: Deferred</code> if temporarily unable, <code>reason: Infeasible</code> if impossible on the node).</li>\n<li><code>PodResizeInProgress</code>: Indicates the resize is accepted and being applied. Errors encountered during this phase are now reported in this condition's message with <code>reason: Error</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sidecar Support:</strong> Resizing <a class=\"glossary-tooltip\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"An auxilliary container that stays running throughout the lifecycle of a Pod.\">sidecar containers</a> in-place is now supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stability-and-reliability-enhancements\">Stability and reliability enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refined Allocated Resources Management:</strong> The allocation management logic with the Kubelet was significantly reworked, making it more consistent and robust. The changes eliminated whole classes of bugs, and greatly improved the reliability of in-place Pod resize.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Checkpointing &amp; State Tracking:</strong> A more robust system for tracking &quot;allocated&quot; and &quot;actuated&quot; resources was implemented, using new checkpoint files (<code>allocated_pods_state</code>, <code>actuated_pods_state</code>) to reliably manage resize state across Kubelet restarts and handle edge cases where runtime-reported resources differ from requested ones. Several bugs related to checkpointing and state restoration were fixed. Checkpointing efficiency was also improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Resize Detection:</strong> Enhancements to the Kubelet's Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) allow the Kubelet to respond to and complete resizes much more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced CRI Integration:</strong> A new <code>UpdatePodSandboxResources</code> CRI call was added to better inform runtimes and plugins (like NRI) about Pod-level resource changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Numerous Bug Fixes:</strong> Addressed issues related to systemd cgroup drivers, handling of containers without limits, CPU minimum share calculations, container restart backoffs, error propagation, test stability, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn't stop here! Here's what the community is focusing on next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stability and Productionization:</strong> Continued focus on hardening the feature, improving performance, and ensuring it is robust for production environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Addressing Limitations:</strong> Working towards relaxing some of the current limitations noted in the documentation, such as allowing memory limit decreases.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-vertically\">VerticalPodAutoscaler</a> (VPA) Integration:</strong> Work to enable VPA to leverage in-place Pod resize is already underway. A new <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> update mode will allow it to attempt non-disruptive resizes first, or fall back to recreation if needed. This will allow users to benefit from VPA's recommendations with significantly less disruption.</li>\n<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Gathering feedback from users adopting the beta feature is crucial for prioritizing further enhancements and addressing any uncovered issues or bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-and-providing-feedback\">Getting started and providing feedback</h2>\n<p>With the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature gate enabled by default in v1.33, you can start experimenting with in-place Pod resizing right away!</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">documentation</a> for detailed guides and examples.</p>\n<p>As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable. Please report any issues or share your experiences via the standard Kubernetes communication channels (GitHub issues, mailing lists, Slack). You can also review the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1287-in-place-update-pod-resources\">KEP-1287: In-place Update of Pod Resources</a> for the full in-depth design details.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing how the community leverages in-place Pod resize to build more efficient and resilient applications on Kubernetes!</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>This announcement originally <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/announcing-etcd-3.6/\">appeared</a> on the etcd blog.</em></p>\n<p>Today, we are releasing <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.6.0\">etcd v3.6.0</a>, the first minor release since etcd v3.5.0 on June 15, 2021. This release\nintroduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing efforts like downgrade support and\nmigration to v3store, and addresses numerous critical &amp; major issues. It also includes major optimizations in\nmemory usage, improving efficiency and performance.</p>\n<p>In addition to the features of v3.6.0, etcd has joined Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve\nproject sustainability. We've introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability.\nThrough the etcd-operator Working Group, we plan to improve usability as well.</p>\n<p>What follows are the most significant changes introduced in etcd v3.6.0, along with the discussion of the\nroadmap for future development. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>etcd takes security seriously. To enhance software security in v3.6.0, we have improved our workflow checks by\nintegrating <code>govulncheck</code> to scan the source code and <code>trivy</code> to scan container images. These improvements\nhave also been backported to supported stable releases.</p>\n<p>etcd continues to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/security/security-release-process.md\">Security Release Process</a> to ensure vulnerabilities are properly managed and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<h3 id=\"migration-to-v3store\">Migration to v3store</h3>\n<p>The v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4 but could still be enabled via <code>--enable-v2</code>. It remained the source of\ntruth for membership data. In etcd v3.6.0, v2store can no longer be enabled as the <code>--enable-v2</code> flag has been removed,\nand v3store has become the sole source of truth for membership data.</p>\n<p>While v2store still exists in v3.6.0, etcd will fail to start if it contains any data other than membership information.\nTo assist with migration, etcd v3.5.18+ provides the <code>etcdutl check v2store</code> command, which verifies that v2store\ncontains only membership data (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19113\">PR 19113</a>).</p>\n<p>Compared to v2store, v3store offers better performance and transactional support. It is also the actively maintained\nstorage engine moving forward.</p>\n<p>The removal of v2store is still ongoing and is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade\">Downgrade</h3>\n<p>etcd v3.6.0 is the first version to fully support downgrade. The effort for this downgrade task spans\nboth versions 3.5 and 3.6, and all related work is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11716\">issues/11716</a>.</p>\n<p>At a high level, the process involves migrating the data schema to the target version (e.g., v3.5),\nfollowed by a rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>Ensure the cluster is healthy, and take a snapshot backup. Validate whether the downgrade is valid:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade validate 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade validate success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the downgrade is valid, enable downgrade mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>etcd will then migrate the data schema in the background. Once complete, proceed with the rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>For details, refer to the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/downgrades/downgrade_3_6/\">Downgrade-3.6</a> guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-gates\">Feature gates</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, we introduced Kubernetes-style feature gates for managing new features. Previously, we\nindicated unstable features through the <code>--experimental</code> prefix in feature flag names. The prefix was removed\nonce the feature was stable, causing a breaking change. Now, features will start in Alpha, progress\nto Beta, then GA, or get deprecated. This ensures a much smoother upgrade and downgrade experience for users.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/feature-gates/\">feature-gates</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livezreadyz-checks\">livez / readyz checks</h3>\n<p>etcd now supports <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code> endpoints, aligning with Kubernetes' Liveness and Readiness probes.\n<code>/livez</code> indicates whether the etcd instance is alive, while <code>/readyz</code> indicates when it is ready to serve requests.\nThis feature has also been backported to release-3.5 (starting from v3.5.11) and release-3.4 (starting from v3.4.29).\nSee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/monitoring/\">livez/readyz</a> for details.</p>\n<p>The existing <code>/health</code> endpoint remains functional. <code>/livez</code> is similar to <code>/health?serializable=true</code>, while\n<code>/readyz</code> is similar to <code>/health</code> or <code>/health?serializable=false</code>. Clearly, the <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code>\nendpoints provide clearer semantics and are easier to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v3discovery\">v3discovery</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, the new discovery protocol <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v3discovery</a> was introduced, based on clientv3.\nIt facilitates the discovery of all cluster members during the bootstrap phase.</p>\n<p>The previous <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v2discovery</a> protocol, based on clientv2, has been deprecated. Additionally,\nthe public discovery service at <a href=\"https://discovery.etcd.io/\">https://discovery.etcd.io/</a>, which relied on v2discovery, is no longer maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"memory\">Memory</h3>\n<p>In this release, we reduced average memory consumption by at least 50% (see Figure 1). This improvement is primarily due to two changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value of <code>--snapshot-count</code> has been reduced from 100,000 in v3.5 to 10,000 in v3.6. As a result, etcd v3.6 now retains only about 10% of the history records compared to v3.5.</li>\n<li>Raft history is compacted more frequently, as introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/18825\">PR/18825</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Diagram of memory usage\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-1.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Memory usage comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under different read/write ratios.\nEach subplot shows the memory usage over time with a specific read/write ratio. The red line represents etcd\nv3.5.20, while the teal line represents v3.6.0-rc.2. Across all tested ratios, v3.6.0-rc.2 exhibits lower and\nmore stable memory usage.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"throughput\">Throughput</h3>\n<p>Compared to v3.5, etcd v3.6 delivers an average performance improvement of approximately 10%\nin both read and write throughput (see Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5). This improvement is not attributed to\nany single major change, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple minor enhancements. One such\nexample is the optimization of the free page queries introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt/pull/419\">PR/419</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"etcd read transaction performance with a high write ratio\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio.

For a complete list, please refer to\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>Old binaries are incompatible with new schema versions</p>\n<p>Old etcd binaries are not compatible with newer data schema versions. For example, etcd 3.5 cannot start with\ndata created by etcd 3.6, and etcd 3.4 cannot start with data created by either 3.5 or 3.6.</p>\n<p>When downgrading etcd, it's important to follow the documented downgrade procedure. Simply replacing\nthe binary or image will result in the incompatibility issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peer-endpoints-no-longer-serve-client-requests\">Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests</h3>\n<p>Client endpoints (<code>--advertise-client-urls</code>) are intended to serve client requests only, while peer\nendpoints (<code>--initial-advertise-peer-urls</code>) are intended solely for peer communication. However, due to an implementation\noversight, the peer endpoints were also able to handle client requests in etcd 3.4 and 3.5. This behavior was misleading and\nencouraged incorrect usage patterns. In etcd 3.6, this misleading behavior was corrected via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13565\">PR/13565</a>; peer endpoints\nno longer serve client requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-boundary-between-etcdctl-and-etcdutl\">Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl</h3>\n<p>Both <code>etcdctl</code> and <code>etcdutl</code> are command line tools. <code>etcdutl</code> is an offline utility designed to operate directly on\netcd data files, while <code>etcdctl</code> is an online tool that interacts with etcd over a network. Previously, there were some\noverlapping functionalities between the two, but these overlaps were removed in 3.6.0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl defrag --data-dir</code></p>\n<p>The <code>etcdctl defrag</code> command only support online defragmentation and no longer supports offline defragmentation.\nTo perform offline defragmentation, use the <code>etcdutl defrag --data-dir</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot status</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports retrieving the status of a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot status</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports restoring from a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot restore</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"critical-bug-fixes\">Critical bug fixes</h2>\n<p>Correctness has always been a top priority for the etcd project. In the process of developing 3.6.0, we found and\nfixed a few notable bugs that could lead to data inconsistency in specific cases. These fixes have been backported\nto previous releases, but we believe they deserve special mention here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Inconsistency when Crashing Under Load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previously, when etcd was applying data, it would update the consistent-index first, followed by committing the\ndata. However, these operations were not atomic. If etcd crashed in between, it could lead to data inconsistency\n(see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766\">issue/13766</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.3 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13854\">PR/13854</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Durability API guarantee broken in single node cluster</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a client writes data and receives a success response, the data is expected to be persisted. However, the data might\nbe lost if etcd crashes immediately after sending the success response to the client. This was a legacy issue (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14370\">issue/14370</a>)\naffecting all previous releases. It was addressed in v3.4.21 and v3.5.5 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14400\">PR/14400</a>, and fixed in raft side in\nmain branch (now release-3.6) with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14413\">PR/14413</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revision Inconsistency when Crashing During Defragmentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If etcd crashed during the defragmentation operation, upon restart, it might reapply\nsome entries which had already been applied, accordingly leading to the revision inconsistency issue\n(see the discussions in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14685\">PR/14685</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.6 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14730\">PR/14730</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrade-issue\">Upgrade issue</h2>\n<p>This section highlights a common issue <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/19557\">issues/19557</a> in the etcd v3.5 to v3.6 upgrade that may cause the upgrade\nprocess to fail. For a complete upgrade guide, refer to <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue was introduced in etcd v3.5.1, and resolved in v3.5.20.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong>: users are required to first upgrade to etcd v3.5.20 (or a higher patch version) before upgrading\nto etcd v3.6.0; otherwise, the upgrade may fail.</p>\n<p>For more background and technical context, see <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue/\">upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing\">Testing</h2>\n<p>We introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness\">Robustness testing</a> to verify correctness, which has always been our top priority.\nIt plays traffic of various types and volumes against an etcd cluster, concurrently injects a random\nfailpoint, records all operations (including both requests and responses), and finally performs a\nlinearizability check. It also verifies that the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api_guarantees/#watch-apis\">Watch APIs</a> guarantees have not been violated.\nThe robustness test increases our confidence in ensuring the quality of each etcd release.</p>\n<p>We have migrated most of the etcd workflow tests to Kubernetes' Prow testing infrastructure to\ntake advantage of its benefit, such as nice dashboards for viewing test results and the ability\nfor contributors to rerun failed tests themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\n<p>While retaining all existing supported platforms, we have promoted Linux/ARM64 to Tier 1 support.\nFor more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/15951\">issues/15951</a>. For the complete list of supported platforms,\nsee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/supported-platform/\">supported-platform</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dependencies\">Dependencies</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependency-bumping-guide\">Dependency bumping guide</h3>\n<p>We have published an official guide on how to bump dependencies for etcd’s main branch and stable releases.\nIt also covers how to update the Go version. For more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/dependency_management.md\">dependency_management</a>.\nWith this guide available, any contributors can now help with dependency upgrades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-dependency-updates\">Core Dependency Updates</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt\">bbolt</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a> are two core dependencies of etcd.</p>\n<p>Both etcd v3.4 and v3.5 depend on bbolt v1.3, while etcd v3.6 depends on bbolt v1.4.</p>\n<p>For the release-3.4 and release-3.5 branches, raft is included in the etcd repository itself, so etcd v3.4 and v3.5\ndo not depend on an external raft module. Starting from etcd v3.6, raft was moved to a separate repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a>),\nand the first standalone raft release is v3.6.0. As a result, etcd v3.6.0 depends on raft v3.6.0.</p>\n<p>Please see the table below for a summary:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>etcd versions</th>\n<th>bbolt versions</th>\n<th>raft versions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3.4.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.5.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.6.x</td>\n<td>v1.4.x</td>\n<td>v3.6.x</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"grpc-gateway-v2\">grpc-gateway@v2</h3>\n<p>We upgraded <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway\">grpc-gateway</a> from v1 to v2 via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/16595\">PR/16595</a> in etcd v3.6.0. This is a major step toward\nmigrating to <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go\">protobuf-go</a>, the second major version of the Go protocol buffer API implementation.</p>\n<p>grpc-gateway@v2 is designed to work with <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go\">protobuf-go</a>. However, etcd v3.6 still depends on the deprecated\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gogo/protobuf\">gogo/protobuf</a>, which is actually protocol buffer v1 implementation. To resolve this incompatibility,\nwe applied a <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/158b9e0d468d310c3edf4cf13f2458c51b0406fa/scripts/genproto.sh#L151-L184\">patch</a> to the generated *.pb.gw.go files to convert v1 messages to v2 messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grpc-ecosystem-go-grpc-middleware-providers-prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus</h3>\n<p>We switched from the deprecated (and archived) <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus</a> to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/tree/main/providers/prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus</a> via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19195\">PR/19195</a>. This change ensures continued\nsupport and access to the latest features and improvements in the gRPC Prometheus integration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"community\">Community</h2>\n<p>There are exciting developments in the etcd community that reflect our ongoing commitment\nto strengthening collaboration, improving maintainability, and evolving the project’s governance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"etcd-becomes-a-kubernetes-sig\">etcd Becomes a Kubernetes SIG</h3>\n<p>etcd has officially become a Kubernetes Special Interest Group: SIG-etcd. This change reflects\netcd’s critical role as the primary datastore for Kubernetes and establishes a more structured\nand transparent home for long-term stewardship and cross-project collaboration. The new SIG\ndesignation will help streamline decision-making, align roadmaps with Kubernetes needs,\nand attract broader community involvement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-contributors-maintainers-and-reviewers\">New contributors, maintainers, and reviewers</h3>\n<p>We’ve seen increasing engagement from contributors, which has resulted in the addition of three new maintainers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fuweid\">fuweid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jmhbnz\">jmhbnz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wenjiaswe\">wenjiaswe</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their continued contributions have been instrumental in driving the project forward.</p>\n<p>We also welcome two new reviewers to the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ivanvc\">ivanvc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/siyuanfoundation\">siyuanfoundation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We appreciate their dedication to code quality and their willingness to take on broader review responsibilities\nwithin the community.</p>\n<p>New release team</p>\n<p>We've formed a new release team led by <a href=\"https://github.com/ivanvc\">ivanvc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jmhbnz\">jmhbnz</a>, streamlining the release process by automating\nmany previously manual steps. Inspired by Kubernetes SIG Release, we've adopted several best practices, including\nclearly defined release team roles and the introduction of release shadows to support knowledge sharing and team\nsustainability. These changes have made our releases smoother and more reliable, allowing us to approach each\nrelease with greater confidence and consistency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-etcd-operator-working-group\">Introducing the etcd Operator Working Group</h3>\n<p>To further advance etcd’s operational excellence, we have formed a new working group: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-etcd-operator\">WG-etcd-operator</a>.\nThe working group is dedicated to enabling the automatic and efficient operation of etcd clusters that run in\nthe Kubernetes environment using an etcd-operator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-development\">Future Development</h2>\n<p>The legacy v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4, and the flag <code>--enable-v2</code> was removed entirely in v3.6.\nThis means that starting from v3.6, there is no longer a way to enable or use the v2store. However, etcd still\nbootstraps internally from the legacy v2 snapshots. To address this inconsistency, We plan to change etcd to\nbootstrap from the v3store and replay the WAL entries based on the <code>consistent-index</code>. The work is being tracked\nin <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the most persistent challenges remains the large range of queries from the kube-apiserver, which can\nlead to process crashes due to their unpredictable nature. The range stream feature, originally outlined in\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2021/announcing-etcd-3.5/#future-roadmaps\">v3.5 release blog/Future roadmaps</a>, remains an idea worth revisiting to address the challenges of large\nrange queries.</p>\n<p>For more details and upcoming plans, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/roadmap.md\">etcd roadmap</a>.</p>",

Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn't use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require <strong>all</strong> Pods to finish successfully\nfor that Job to reach an overall succeeded state.</p>\n<p>For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>\nfield (you can only use the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code> field for an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concept/workloads/controllers/job/#completion-mode\">indexed Job</a>).\nWhich describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes.</p>\n<p>This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads.\nUsers in these areas often run numerous experiments and may only need a specific number to complete successfully, rather than requiring all of them to succeed.\nIn this case, the leader index failure is the only relevant Job exit criteria, and the outcomes for individual follower Pods are handled\nonly indirectly via the status of the leader index.\nMoreover, followers do not know when they can terminate themselves.</p>\n<p>After Job meets any <strong>Success Policy</strong>, the Job is marked as succeeded, and all Pods are terminated including the running ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The following excerpt from a Job manifest, using <code>.successPolicy.rules[0].succeededCount</code>, shows an example of\nusing a custom success policy:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes v1.33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default).\nThere is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated.</p>\n<p>This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zero-value-for-sleep-action\">Zero value for Sleep action</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.29 introduced the <code>Sleep</code> action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the <code>sleep</code> command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you'd need to have the binary for the <code>sleep</code> command in your container image. This is difficult if you're using third party images.</p>\n<p>The sleep action when it was added initially didn't have support for a sleep duration of zero seconds. The <code>time.Sleep</code> which the Sleep action uses under the hood supports a duration of zero seconds. Using a negative or a zero value for the sleep returns immediately, resulting in a no-op. We wanted the same behaviour with the sleep action. This support for the zero duration was later added in v1.32, with the <code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate.</p>\n<p>The <code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate has graduated to beta in v1.33, and is now enabled by default.\nThe original Sleep action for <code>preStop</code> and <code>postStart</code> hooks is been enabled by default, starting from Kubernetes v1.30.\nWith a cluster running Kubernetes v1.33, you are able to set a\nzero duration for sleep lifecycle hooks. For a cluster with default configuration, you don't need\nto enable any feature gate to make that possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"container-stop-signals\">Container stop signals</h2>\n<p>Container runtimes such as containerd and CRI-O honor a <code>StopSignal</code> instruction in the container image definition. This can be used to specify a custom stop signal\nthat the runtime will used to terminate containers based on that image.\nStop signal configuration was not originally part of the Pod API in Kubernetes.\nUntil Kubernetes v1.33, the only way to override the stop signal for containers was by rebuilding your container image with the new custom stop signal\n(for example, specifying <code>STOPSIGNAL</code> in a <code>Containerfile</code> or <code>Dockerfile</code>).</p>\n<p>The <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate which is newly added in Kubernetes v1.33 adds stop signals to the Kubernetes API. This allows users to specify a custom stop signal in the container spec. Stop signals are added to the API as a new lifecycle along with the existing PreStop and PostStart lifecycle handlers. In order to use this feature, we expect the Pod to have the operating system specified with <code>spec.os.name</code>. This is enforced so that we can cross-validate the stop signal against the operating system and make sure that the containers in the Pod are created with a valid stop signal for the operating system the Pod is being scheduled to. For Pods scheduled on Windows nodes, only <code>SIGTERM</code> and <code>SIGKILL</code> are allowed as valid stop signals. Find the full list of signals supported in Linux nodes <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/api/core/v1/types.go#L2985-L3053\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"default-behaviour\">Default behaviour</h3>\n<p>If a container has a custom stop signal defined in its lifecycle, the container runtime would use the signal defined in the lifecycle to kill the container, given that the container runtime also supports custom stop signals. If there is no custom stop signal defined in the container lifecycle, the runtime would fallback to the stop signal defined in the container image. If there is no stop signal defined in the container image, the default stop signal of the runtime would be used. The default signal is <code>SIGTERM</code> for both containerd and CRI-O.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-skew\">Version skew</h3>\n<p>For the feature to work as intended, both the versions of Kubernetes and the container runtime should support container stop signals. The changes to the Kuberentes API and kubelet are available in alpha stage from v1.33, which can be enabled with the <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate. The container runtime implementations for containerd and CRI-O are still a work in progress and will be rolled out soon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-container-stop-signals\">Using container stop signals</h3>\n<p>To enable this feature, you need to turn on the <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in both the kube-apiserver and the kubelet. Once you have nodes where the feature gate is turned on, you can create Pods with a StopSignal lifecycle and a valid OS name like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Pod<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">os</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>linux<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">containers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx:latest<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">lifecycle</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">stopSignal</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>SIGUSR1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Do note that the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal in this example can only be used if the container's Pod is scheduled to a Linux node.

To begin, <em>Pod A</em> in <em>Namespace X</em> is scheduled to <em>Node 1</em> and requires <em>image Foo</em> from a private repository.\nFor it's image pull authentication material, the pod references <em>Secret 1</em> in its <code>imagePullSecrets</code>. <em>Secret 1</em> contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from <em>Secret 1</em> as supplied by <em>Pod A</em>\nand it will pull <em>container image Foo</em> from the registry. This is the intended (and secure)\nbehavior.</p>\n<p>But now things get curious. If <em>Pod B</em> in <em>Namespace Y</em> happens to also be scheduled to <em>Node 1</em>, unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. <em>Pod B</em> may reference the same private image, specifying the <code>IfNotPresent</code> image pull policy. <em>Pod B</em> does not reference <em>Secret 1</em>\n(or in our case, any secret) in its <code>imagePullSecrets</code>. When the Kubelet tries to run the pod, it honors the <code>IfNotPresent</code> policy. The Kubelet sees that the <em>image Foo</em> is already present locally, and will provide <em>image Foo</em> to <em>Pod B</em>. <em>Pod B</em> gets to run the image even though it did not provide credentials authorizing it to pull the image in the first place.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Illustration of the process of two pods trying to access a private image, the first one with a pull secret, the second one without it\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/12/kubernetes-v1-33-ensure-secret-pulled-images-alpha/ensure_secret_image_pulls.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Using a private image pulled by a different pod</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>While <code>IfNotPresent</code> should not pull <em>image Foo</em> if it is already present\non the node, it is an incorrect security posture to allow all pods scheduled\nto a node to have access to previously pulled private image. These pods were never\nauthorized to pull the image in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ifnotpresent-but-only-if-i-am-supposed-to-have-it\">IfNotPresent, but only if I am supposed to have it</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.33, we - SIG Auth and SIG Node - have finally started to address this (really old) problem and getting the verification right! The basic expected behavior is not changed. If\nan image is not present, the Kubelet will attempt to pull the image. The credentials each pod supplies will be utilized for this task. This matches behavior prior to 1.33.</p>\n<p>If the image is present, then the behavior of the Kubelet changes. The Kubelet will now\nverify the pod's credentials before allowing the pod to use the image.</p>\n<p>Performance and service stability have been a consideration while revising the feature.\nPods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate. This is\nalso true when pods source credentials from the same Kubernetes Secret object, even\nwhen the credentials are rotated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"never-pull-but-use-if-authorized\">Never pull, but use if authorized</h2>\n<p>The <code>imagePullPolicy: Never</code> option does not fetch images. However, if the\ncontainer image is already present on the node, any pod attempting to use the private\nimage will be required to provide credentials, and those credentials require verification.</p>\n<p>Pods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate.\nPods that do not supply credentials previously used to successfully pull an\nimage will not be allowed to use the private image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"always-pull-if-authorized\">Always pull, if authorized</h2>\n<p>The <code>imagePullPolicy: Always</code> has always worked as intended. Each time an image\nis requested, the request goes to the registry and the registry will perform an authentication\ncheck.</p>\n<p>In the past, forcing the <code>Always</code> image pull policy via pod admission was the only way to ensure\nthat your private container images didn't get reused by other pods on nodes which already pulled the images.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this was somewhat performant. Only the image manifest was pulled, not the image. However, there was still a cost and a risk. During a new rollout, scale up, or pod restart, the image registry that provided the image MUST be available for the auth check, putting the image registry in the critical path for stability of services running inside of the cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-all-works\">How it all works</h2>\n<p>The feature is based on persistent, file-based caches that are present on each of\nthe nodes. The following is a simplified description of how the feature works.\nFor the complete version, please see <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535</a>.</p>\n<p>The process of requesting an image for the first time goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A pod requesting an image from a private registry is scheduled to a node.</li>\n<li>The image is not present on the node.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet makes a record of the intention to pull the image.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet extracts credentials from the Kubernetes Secret referenced by the pod\nas an image pull secret, and uses them to pull the image from the private registry.</li>\n<li>After the image has been successfully pulled, the Kubelet makes a record of\nthe successful pull. This record includes details about credentials used\n(in the form of a hash) as well as the Secret from which they originated.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet removes the original record of intent.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet retains the record of successful pull for later use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When future pods scheduled to the same node request the previously pulled private image:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Kubelet checks the credentials that the new pod provides for the pull.</li>\n<li>If the hash of these credentials, or the source Secret of the credentials match\nthe hash or source Secret which were recorded for a previous successful pull,\nthe pod is allowed to use the previously pulled image.</li>\n<li>If the credentials or their source Secret are not found in the records of\nsuccessful pulls for that image, the Kubelet will attempt to use\nthese new credentials to request a pull from the remote registry, triggering\nthe authorization flow.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.33 we shipped the alpha version of this feature. To give it a spin,\nenable the <code>KubeletEnsureSecretPulledImages</code> feature gate for your 1.33 Kubelets.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the feature and additional optional configuration on the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#ensureimagepullcredentialverification\">concept page for Images</a>\nin the official Kubernetes documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>In future releases we are going to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make this feature work together with <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4412\">Projected service account tokens for Kubelet image credential providers</a> which adds a new, workload-specific source of image pull credentials.</li>\n<li>Write a benchmarking suite to measure the performance of this feature and assess the impact of\nany future changes.</li>\n<li>Implement an in-memory caching layer so that we don't need to read files for each image\npull request.</li>\n<li>Add support for credential expirations, thus forcing previously validated credentials to\nbe re-authenticated.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-involved\">How to get involved</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">Reading KEP-2535</a> is a great way to understand these changes in depth.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in further involvement, reach out to us on the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C04UMAUC4UA\">#sig-auth-authenticators-dev</a> channel\non Kubernetes Slack (for an invitation, visit <a href=\"https://slack.k8s.io/\">https://slack.k8s.io/</a>).\nYou are also welcome to join the bi-weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-auth/README.md#meetings\">SIG Auth meetings</a>,\nheld every other Wednesday.</p>",

One reviewer wants the labels updated, another asks for side-by-side layouts, someone else requests bold formatting, and don't forget about that button color change. Before you know it, you're spending hours implementing feedback that, while important, takes you away from building new features. It's a time-consuming process that every developer faces, yet it feels like there should be a better way.</p>\n<p>What if you could have an AI assistant that understands code review feedback and automatically implements the changes for you? That's exactly what <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/17/gitlab-duo-with-amazon-q-agentic-ai-optimized-for-aws/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</a> brings to your development workflow. This seamless integration combines GitLab's comprehensive DevSecOps platform with Amazon Q's advanced AI capabilities, creating an intelligent assistant that can read reviewer comments and converts them directly into code changes. Instead of manually addressing each piece of feedback, you can let AI handle the implementation while you focus on the bigger picture.</p>\n<h2>How GitLab Duo with Amazon Q works</h2>\n<p>When you're viewing a merge request with reviewer comments, you'll see feedback scattered throughout your code. Let's take the examples from earlier in this article: maybe you've received a request to update a form label here, a suggestion to display fields side-by-side there, or a note about making certain text bold. Each comment represents a task that normally you'd need to handle manually.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"feedback on an MR\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2ZTbiXukxbPHcV941RQVnn/ec9ec6c5f2f02a01abc7b085fb3c93f7/1-show-comment.png\" /></p>\n<p>With GitLab Duo with Amazon Q, you can simply enter the <code>/q dev</code> quick action in a comment. This prompts Amazon Q to analyze all the feedback and start modifying your code automatically. The AI agent understands the context of each comment and implements the requested changes directly in your codebase.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"/q dev function prompting Amazon Q to analyze feedback\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3WyGnTVcEvSPwUHEKPTupJ/0b92110efc91409bdbf2aff2616a3a3a/2-invoke-q-dev.png\" /></p>\n<p>Once Amazon Q processes the feedback, you can view all the updates in the &quot;Changes&quot; tab of your merge request. Every modification is clearly visible, so you can verify that the AI agent correctly interpreted and implemented each piece of feedback. You can then run your updated application to confirm that all the changes work as expected — that form label is updated, the fields are displayed side-by-side, the text is bold, and yes, that button is now blue.</p>\n<p>Watch the code review feedback process in action:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/31E9X9BrK5s?si=ThFywR34V3Bfj1Z-&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>Processing code review feedback is a necessary but time-intensive part of software development.  GitLab Duo with Amazon Q evolves this manual process into an automated workflow, dramatically reducing the time between receiving feedback and implementing changes. By letting AI handle these routine modifications, you're free to focus on what really matters — building innovative features and solving complex problems.</p>\n<p>With GitLab Duo with Amazon Q, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminate hours of manual feedback implementation</li>\n<li>Accelerate your code review cycles</li>\n<li>Maintain consistency in how feedback is addressed</li>\n<li>Reduce context switching between reviewing comments and writing code</li>\n<li>Ship features faster with streamlined deployment times</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>To learn more about GitLab Duo with Amazon Q visit us at an upcoming <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/events/aws-summits/\">AWS Summit in a city near you</a> or <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/aws/#form\">reach out to your GitLab representative</a>.</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>GitLab Duo with Amazon Q resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/17/gitlab-duo-with-amazon-q-agentic-ai-optimized-for-aws/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q: Agentic AI optimized for AWS generally available</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/aws/\">GitLab and AWS partner page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_amazon_q/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/agentic-ai/\">What is agentic AI?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/05/07/agentic-ai-guides-and-resources/\">Agentic AI guides and resources</a></li>\n</ul>",

Development teams must support multidisciplinary collaboration across technical and non-technical departments while managing vast amounts of sensitive data – from student records and financial information to research findings and faculty evaluations.</p>\n<p>Most institutions face these challenges with limited IT resources, yet must support thousands of concurrent users across numerous projects and research initiatives. Research integrity requirements add another layer of complexity, as development work often needs to maintain traceability and reproducibility standards.</p>\n<h2>Premium solutions for educational institutions</h2>\n<p>GitLab Premium with Duo has the functionality that higher education needs.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced collaboration and workflow capabilities</h3>\n<p>Cross-departmental projects are common in educational settings – from multi-department research initiatives to custom module development for systems like Ellucian Banner, an enterprise resource planning application used by higher education. These complex projects require sophisticated workflow management that goes beyond basic version control.</p>\n<p>GitLab Premium addresses these challenges with powerful collaboration and project visualization features, including epics, roadmaps, and advanced Kanban boards for Agile development workflows. When you assign multiple approvers to certain merge requests and protected branches, you ensure higher code quality and accountability across teams. These tools allow institutions to coordinate work across departments while aligning with institution-wide objectives – essential for managing multiphase campus technology initiatives.</p>\n<p>In Australia, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/customers/deakin-university/\">Deakin University’s</a> enablement team uses GitLab to build standardized processes and reusable templates — such as custom merge request templates, templated build pipelines, and a security and compliance framework — that can be shared with the broader university community and citizen developers, driving innovation and collaboration both inside the university and with key partners. “We were trying to bring in a community of practice and help it thrive for quite some time, but we were never successful until we had this tool,” said Aaron Whitehand, director of Digital Enablement at Deakin University.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Read more about <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/customers/deakin-university/\">how Deakin University uses GitLab to drive improvements</a> in collaboration and productivity, including a 60% reduction in manual tasks.</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Advanced data protection and governance</h3>\n<p>Educational institutions generate and manage vast amounts of data, ranging from student records and financial information to research findings and faculty evaluations. The security stakes are particularly high. The <a href=\"https://universitybusiness.com/in-just-3-months-this-data-breach-has-compromised-nearly-900-institutions/\">2023 MOVEit breach</a>, which spanned three months and compromised approximately 900 educational institutions, exposed the sensitive information of more than 62 million people. This demonstrates the critical need for proactive security measures integrated directly into higher education development workflows.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability scanning stops code releases that contain security risks, enabling institutions to establish and enforce governance protocols that protect sensitive information. These capabilities help universities implement proper access controls and permission structures for research databases, creating a secure framework where authorized researchers maintain appropriate access – effectively balancing robust protection with necessary collaboration.</p>\n<p>GitLab is built from the ground up to secure your source code. Scalable Git-based repositories, granular access controls, and built-in compliance features eliminate bottlenecks in your workflow while meeting security requirements. GitLab Premium provides audit tracking and compliance capabilities essential for educational environments. Complete audit trails capture detailed logs of all code changes, access attempts, and system modifications with timestamps and user attribution. Full change management documentation ensures traceability of who made what changes, when, and why – critical for research integrity – while access control auditing monitors repository access and permissions changes.</p>\n<h3>Cloud-based development environments and remote collaboration</h3>\n<p>Modern educational institutions require flexible development environments that support distributed teams, remote learning scenarios, and diverse technical requirements.

Since then, we've made significant progress towards improving our security posture and creating a more secure ecosystem for our customers to develop secure software faster.</p>\n<h2>Meeting the security goals</h2>\n<p>Let’s explore the additions and improvements we've made to further enhance security across the development lifecycle.</p>\n<h3>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Goal: Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of multi-factor authentication across the manufacturer’s products.</strong></em></p>\n<p>GitLab currently offers multiple <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.html\">MFA</a> options for users to secure their accounts. We also offer SSO functionality to enable <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/\">GitLab.com</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/integration/saml/\">Self-Managed</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/integration/saml/\">GitLab Dedicated</a> customers to streamline their authentication processes and their internal MFA requirements.</p>\n<p>To further enhance the platform’s resilience, and to create a more secure foundation for our customers, GitLab is executing a phased MFA by Default rollout.</p>\n<p>In the coming months, we will deploy changes requiring all customers to enable MFA on their accounts.</p>\n<p>For customers who already have MFA enabled or authenticate to GitLab via their organization’s single sign-on (SSO) method, there will be no necessary changes. For customers who do not already have MFA enabled and are not authenticating to GitLab via their organization’s SSO method, they will be required to enable MFA and enroll in one or more of the available MFA methods.</p>\n<p>The MFA rollout will occur in stages to ensure a smooth and consistent adoption across all customers. More details on GitLab’s MFA by Default rollout will be shared in the near future.</p>\n<h3>Default passwords</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Goal: Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable progress towards reducing default passwords across the manufacturers’ products.</strong></em></p>\n<p>To reduce the use of default passwords, GitLab uses randomly generated root passwords for its multiple installation methods. GitLab’s multi-method <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/install_methods.html\">installation instructions</a> also include guidance on how to change the randomly generated root password for each installation.</p>\n<p>For some install methods, such as installing GitLab in a Docker container, the password file with the initial root password is deleted in the first container restart after 24 hours to help further harden the GitLab instance.</p>\n<h3>Reducing entire classes of vulnerabilities</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Goal: Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken towards enabling a significant measurable reduction in the prevalence of one or more vulnerability classes across the manufacturer’s products.</strong></em></p>\n<p>GitLab has published <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/secure_coding_guidelines.html#sast-coverage\">secure coding guidelines</a> to its documentation site that contains descriptions and guidelines for addressing security vulnerabilities commonly identified in the GitLab codebase.</p>\n<p>The guidelines are “intended to help developers identify potential security vulnerabilities early, with the goal of reducing the number of vulnerabilities released over time.”</p>\n<p>GitLab continues to improve its <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/development/secure_coding_guidelines#sast-coverage\">SAST rule coverage</a> to address broader sets of security vulnerabilities for itself and its customers.</p>\n<h3>Security patches</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Goal: Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the installation of security patches by customers.</strong></em></p>\n<p>GitLab handles all updates related to its GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated service offerings.

      "summary": "<p>Repository backups are a critical component of any robust disaster recovery strategy. However, as repositories grow in size, the process of creating reliable backups becomes increasingly challenging.  Our own <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\">Rails repository</a> was taking 48 hours to back up — forcing impossible choices between backup frequency and system performance. We wanted to tackle this issue for our customers and for our own users internally.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we traced the issue to a 15-year-old Git function with O(N²) complexity and fixed it with an algorithmic change, <strong>reducing backup times exponentially</strong>. The result: lower costs, reduced risk, and backup strategies that actually scale with your codebase.</p>\n<p>This turned out to be a Git scalability issue that affects anyone with large repositories. Here's how we tracked it down and fixed it.</p>\n<h2>Backup at scale</h2>\n<p>First, let's look at the problem. As organizations scale their repositories and backups grow more complex, here are some of the challenges they can face:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time-prohibitive backups:</strong> For very large repositories, creating a repository backup could take several hours, which can hinder the ability to schedule regular backups.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource intensity:</strong> Extended backup processes can consume substantial server resources, potentially impacting other operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Backup windows:</strong> Finding adequate maintenance windows for such lengthy processes can be difficult for teams running 24/7 operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased failure risk:</strong> Long-running processes are more susceptible to interruptions from network issues, server restarts, and system errors, which can force teams to restart the entire very long backup process from scratch.</li>\n<li><strong>Race conditions:</strong> Because it takes a long time to create a backup, the repository might have changed a lot during the process, potentially creating an invalid backup or interrupting the backup because objects are no longer available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These challenges can lead to compromising on backup frequency or completeness – an unacceptable trade-off when it comes to data protection. Extended backup windows can force customers into workarounds. Some might adopt external tooling, while others might reduce backup frequency, resulting in potential inconsistent data protection strategies across organizations.</p>\n<p>Now, let's dig into how we identified a performance bottleneck, found a resolution, and deployed it to help cut backup times.</p>\n<h2>The technical challenge</h2>\n<p>GitLab's repository backup functionality relies on the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle\"><code>git bundle create</code></a> command, which captures a complete snapshot of a repository, including all objects and references like branches and tags. This bundle serves as a restoration point for recreating the repository in its exact state.</p>\n<p>However, the implementation of the command suffered from poor scalability related to reference count, creating a performance bottleneck. As repositories accumulated more references, processing time increased exponentially. In our largest repositories containing millions of references, backup operations could extend beyond 48 hours.</p>\n<h3>Root cause analysis</h3>\n<p>To identify the root cause of this performance bottleneck, we analyzed a flame graph of the command during execution.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Flame graph showing command during execution\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/7IS0wTEb44v1DTFKdklt1s/f8c724b1578ef0c8f550d9237f03dbeb/image1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>A flame graph displays the execution path of a command through its stack trace. Each bar corresponds to a function in the code, with the bar's width indicating how much time the command spent executing within that particular function.</p>\n<p>When examining the flame graph of <code>git bundle create</code> running on a repository with 10,000 references, approximately 80% of the execution time is consumed by the <code>object_array_remove_duplicates()</code> function. This function was introduced to Git in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/b2a6d1c686\">commit b2a6d1c686</a> (bundle: allow the same ref to be given more than once, 2009-01-17).</p>\n<p>To understand this change, it's important to know that <code>git bundle create</code> allows users to specify which references to include in the bundle. For complete repository bundles, the <code>--all</code> flag packages all references.</p>\n<p>The commit addressed a problem where users providing duplicate references through the command line – such as <code>git bundle create main.bundle main main</code> - would create a bundle without properly handling the duplicated main reference. Unbundling this bundle in a Git repository would break, because it tries to write the same ref twice. The code to avoid duplication uses nested <code>for</code> loops that iterate through all references to identify duplicates. This O(N²) algorithm becomes a significant performance bottleneck in repositories with large reference counts, consuming substantial processing time.</p>\n<h3>The fix: From O(N²) to efficient mapping</h3>\n<p>To resolve this performance issue, we contributed an upstream fix to Git that replaces the nested loops with a map data structure. Each reference is added to the map, which automatically ensures only a single copy of each reference is retained for processing.</p>\n<p>This change dramatically enhances the performance of <code>git bundle create</code> and enables much better scalability in repositories with large reference counts. Benchmark testing on a repository with 10,000 references demonstrates a 6x performance improvement.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">Benchmark 1: bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = master)\n  Time (mean ± σ): \t14.653 s ±  0.203 s\t[User: 13.940 s, System: 0.762 s]\n  Range (min … max):   14.237 s … 14.920 s\t10 runs\n\nBenchmark 2: bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = HEAD)\n  Time (mean ± σ):  \t2.394 s ±  0.023 s\t[User: 1.684 s, System: 0.798 s]\n  Range (min … max):\t2.364 s …  2.425 s\t10 runs\n\nSummary\n  bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = HEAD) ran\n\t6.12 ± 0.10 times faster than bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = master)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The patch was accepted and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/bb74c0abbc31da35be52999569ea481ebd149d1d\">merged</a> into upstream Git. At GitLab, we backported this fix to ensure our customers could benefit immediately, without waiting for the next Git release.</p>\n<h2>The result: Dramatically decreased backup times</h2>\n<p>The performance gains from this improvement have been nothing short of transformative:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>From 48 hours to 41 minutes:</strong> Creating a backup of our largest repository (<code>gitlab-org/gitlab</code>) now takes just 1.4% of the original time.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent performance:</strong> The improvement scales reliably across repository sizes.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource efficiency:</strong> We significantly reduced server load during backup operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Broader applicability:</strong> While backup creation sees the most dramatic improvement, all bundle-based operations that operate on many references benefit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What this means for GitLab customers</h2>\n<p>For GitLab customers, this enhancement delivers immediate and tangible benefits on how organizations approach repository backup and disaster recovery planning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transformed backup strategies</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Enterprise teams can establish comprehensive nightly schedules without impacting development workflows or requiring extensive backup windows.</li>\n<li>Backups can now run seamlessly in the background during nightly schedules, instead of needing to be dedicated and lengthy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced business continuity</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>With backup times reduced from days to minutes, organizations significantly minimize their recovery point objectives (RPO). This translates to reduced business risk – in a disaster scenario, you're potentially recovering hours of work instead of days.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced operational overhead</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Less server resource consumption and shorter maintenance windows.</li>\n<li>Shorter backup windows mean reduced compute costs, especially in cloud environments, where extended processing time translates directly to higher bills.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Future-proofed infrastructure</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Growing repositories no longer force difficult choices between backup frequency and system performance.</li>\n<li>As your codebase expands, your backup strategy can scale seamlessly alongside it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations can now implement more robust backup strategies without compromising on performance or completeness. What was once a challenging trade-off has become a straightforward operational practice.</p>\n<p>Starting with the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/05/15/gitlab-18-0-released/\">GitLab 18.0</a> release, all GitLab customers regardless of their license tier can already fully take advantage of these improvements for their <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/backup_restore/backup_gitlab/\">backup</a> strategy and execution. There is no further change in configuration required.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>This breakthrough is part of our ongoing commitment to scalable, enterprise-grade Git infrastructure. While the improvement of 48 hours to 41 minutes for backup creation time represents a significant milestone, we continue to identify and address performance bottlenecks throughout our stack.</p>\n<p>We're particularly proud that this enhancement was contributed upstream to the Git project, benefiting not just GitLab users but the broader Git community. This collaborative approach to development ensures that improvements are thoroughly reviewed, widely tested, and available to all.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deep infrastructure work like this is how we approach performance at GitLab.

      "summary": "<p>Software in embedded systems is no longer just a part number — it's a critical differentiator. This shift has led to enormous complexity in the firmware running in our cars, airplanes, and industrial machines. The number of lines of code in the average car is expected to reach <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1370978/automotive-software-average-lines-of-codes-per-vehicle-globally/\">650 million</a> by the end of 2025, up from 200 million just five years ago. In aerospace systems, the complexity of embedded software has nearly <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/debugging-the-software-talent-gap-in-aerospace-and-defense\">doubled every four years</a> for the last several decades.</p>\n<p>Traditional embedded development approaches cannot effectively handle the software challenges of modern machines.

In this article, we’ll explain four ways you can use the GitLab AI-native DevSecOps platform to shorten feedback loops, work collaboratively and iteratively, and streamline compliance.</p>\n<h2>Challenge 1: Hardware testing bottlenecks</h2>\n<p>Unlike enterprise software that can run on virtually any cloud server, embedded automotive software must be tested on specialized hardware that precisely matches production environments. Traditional hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing processes often follow this pattern:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Developers write code for an embedded system (e.g., an electronic control unit)</li>\n<li>They request access to limited, expensive hardware test benches (costing $500,000-$10M each)</li>\n<li>They wait days or weeks for their scheduled access window</li>\n<li>They manually deploy and test their code on physical hardware at their desks</li>\n<li>They document results, pass the hardware to the next developer, and go to the back of the hardware testing queue</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This process is extremely inefficient. Embedded developers may finish writing their code today and wait weeks to test it on a hardware target. By then, they've moved on to other tasks. This context switching drains productivity. Not only that, developers may wait weeks to learn they had a simple math error in their code.</p>\n<h3>Solution: Automated hardware allocation and continuous integration</h3>\n<p>You can streamline hardware testing through automation using the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/embedded/ci-components/device-cloud\">GitLab On-Premises Device Cloud</a>, a CI/CD component. This lets you automate the orchestration of scarce hardware resources, turning a manual, time-intensive process into a streamlined, continuous workflow.</p>\n<p>The On-Premises Device Cloud:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creates pools of shared hardware resources</li>\n<li>Automatically — and exclusively — allocates hardware to a developer’s hardware testing pipeline tasks based on availability</li>\n<li>Deploys and executes tests without manual intervention</li>\n<li>Collects and reports results through integrated pipelines</li>\n<li>Automatically deallocates hardware back into the “available” pool</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After submitting code, you’ll receive results in hours instead of days, often without ever physically touching the test hardware.</p>\n<p>What this video for an introduction to the GitLab On-Premises Device Cloud CI/CD Component to orchestrate the remote allocation of shared hardware for HIL:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltr2CIM9Zag?si=NOij3t1YYz4zKajC&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>You can also adopt multi-pronged testing strategies that balance speed and quality. Bring the following embedded test patterns and environments into automated GitLab CI pipelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Software-in-the-loop (SIL):</strong> Testing on virtual hardware simulators for quicker initial feedback</li>\n<li><strong>Processor-in-the-loop (PIL):</strong> Testing on representative processor hardware for faster feedback at a lower cost</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL):</strong> Testing on full production-equivalent hardware and test benches for late-stage verification</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By automating the orchestration of these tests within CI pipelines, you’ll be able to identify issues earlier, iterate faster, and accelerate time to market.</p>\n<h2>Challenge 2: Inconsistent build environments</h2>\n<p>Another significant challenge in embedded development is build environment inconsistency. Embedded developers often manually execute builds on their local machines with varying configurations, compiler versions, and dependencies. Then they’ll paste the binaries from their local build to a shared codebase.</p>\n<p>This approach creates several problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inconsistent outputs:</strong> Builds for the same source code produce different results on different machines</li>\n<li><strong>&quot;Works on my machine&quot; syndrome:</strong> Code that builds locally fails in shared environments</li>\n<li><strong>Poor traceability:</strong> Limited audit trail of who built what and when</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge silos:</strong> Build expertise becomes concentrated in a few individuals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach can lead to errors, bottlenecks, and costly delays.</p>\n<h3>Solution: Standardized build automation</h3>\n<p>You can address these challenges by implementing standardized build automation within CI/CD pipelines in GitLab. This approach creates consistent, repeatable, container-based build environments that eliminate machine-specific variations. Through the use of special Embedded Gateway Runner provisioning scripts, containers can interface with hardware for flashing and port monitoring for automated testing.</p>\n<p>Key elements of this solution include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lifecycle managed environments:</strong> Define complex embedded simulation environments as code; automatically deploy environments for testing and destroy them afterward</li>\n<li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Use Docker containers to ensure identical build environments</li>\n<li><strong>Automated dependency management:</strong> Control and version all dependencies</li>\n<li><strong>Central build execution:</strong> Run builds on shared infrastructure rather than local machines</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Follow this tutorial to learn <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/embedded/workshops/embedded-devops-workshop-refactoring-to-ci/-/blob/main/TUTORIAL2.md%20\">how to automate embedded software builds within a GitLab CI pipeline</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By standardizing and automating the build process, you can ensure that every build follows the same steps with the same dependencies, producing consistent outputs regardless of who initiated it. This not only improves quality but also democratizes the build process, enabling more team members to participate without specialized knowledge.</p>\n<h2>Challenge 3: Siloed development practices</h2>\n<p>Enterprise development teams have widely adopted collaborative practices such as DevOps, underpinned by shared source code management (SCM) and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems. Embedded developers, on the other hand, have historically worked alone at their desks. There are valid technical reasons for this.</p>\n<p>For example, consider hardware virtualization, which is a key enabler of DevOps automation. The industry has been slower to virtualize the massive range of specialized processors and boards used in embedded systems. This is due in large part to the difficulties of virtualizing production real-time systems and the associated lack of economic incentives. Compare that to cloud virtualization which has been commoditized and benefited enterprise SaaS development for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Many providers are now embracing virtualization-first for the sake of speeding up embedded development. If teams fail to adopt virtual testing options, however, their silos will remain and negatively impact the business through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge fragmentation</strong>: Critical insights remain scattered across individuals and teams</li>\n<li><strong>Redundant development</strong>: Multiple teams solve identical problems, creating inconsistencies</li>\n<li><strong>Late-stage discovery during big-bang integrations</strong>: Problems are found late in the process when multiple developers integrate their code at once, when errors are more costly to fix</li>\n<li><strong>Stifled innovation</strong>: Solutions from one domain rarely influence others, hampering the development of new product ideas</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Solution: Collaborative engineering through a unified platform</h3>\n<p>An important step in breaking down these silos is to standardize embedded development around GitLab’s unified DevSecOps platform. In this regard, GitLab is aligned with the shift of embedded systems toward more consolidated, shared platforms on embedded devices. GitLab enables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shared visibility:</strong> Make all code, Issues, and documentation visible across teams</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborative workflows:</strong> Enable peer review and knowledge sharing through merge requests</li>\n<li><strong>Centralized knowledge:</strong> Maintain a single source of truth for all development artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Asynchronous collaboration:</strong> Allow teams to work together across different locations and time zones</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Human-AI agent collaboration is a fundamental ingredient to fueling the customer-facing innovations that digital natives and established embedded brands desire. GitLab enables human-AI collaboration as well. By creating transparency across the development lifecycle, GitLab changes embedded development from an isolated activity to a collaborative practice. Engineers can see each other's work in progress, learn from collective experiences, and build upon shared solutions.</p>\n<p>Watch this presentation from Embedded World Germany 2025, which explains the power of embedded developers collaborating and sharing “work in progress”. The demo portion from 24:42 to 36:51 shows how to integrate HIL into a GitLab CI pipeline and enable collaborative development.</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_rlOyq0hzc?si=eF4alDY6HK98uZPj&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, by achieving greater collaboration through DevSecOps, teams can unlock embedded systems innovations that would otherwise remain hidden. Indeed, collaboration fuels innovation. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597800928887\">One study</a>, for example, found that group brainstorming, when properly structured, can lead to more innovative and creative outcomes than individuals working alone. Collaborative development is crucial in the race to develop software-defined products.</p>\n<h2>Challenge 4: Manual functional safety compliance processes</h2>\n<p>Embedded systems in the automotive and aerospace industries must comply with rigorous functional safety standards, including ISO 26262, MISRA C/C++, DO-178C, and DO-254. Traditional compliance approaches involve manual reviews, extensive documentation, and separate verification activities that occur late in the development cycle. This often creates security review bottlenecks. When specialized embedded security and code quality scanners detect vulnerabilities in a developer’s code, the scan issue gets added to a pile of other issues that haven’t been resolved. Developers can’t integrate their code, and security personnel need to wade through a backlog of code violations. This creates delays and makes compliance more difficult.</p>\n<p>Some of the challenges can best be summed up as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Late-stage compliance issues</strong>: Problems discovered after development is complete</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation burden</strong>: Extensive manual effort to create and maintain compliance evidence</li>\n<li><strong>Process bottlenecks</strong>: Serial compliance activities that block development progress</li>\n<li><strong>Expertise dependence</strong>: Reliance on limited specialists for compliance activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, teams often need to choose between velocity and compliance — a precarious trade-off in safety-critical systems.</p>\n<h3>Solution: Automated functional safety compliance workflow building blocks</h3>\n<p>Rather than treating security and compliance as post-development verification activities, you can codify compliance requirements and enforce them automatically through <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/17/introducing-custom-compliance-frameworks-in-gitlab/\">customizable frameworks in GitLab</a>. To do this for functional safety standards, in particular, you can integrate GitLab with specialized embedded tools, which provide the depth of firmware scanning required by functional safety standards. Meanwhile, GitLab provides automated compliance checks, full audit trails, and merge request gating — all features needed to support a robust continuous compliance program.</p>\n<p>This integrated approach includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compliance-as-code:</strong> Define compliance requirements as automated checks</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated specialized tools:</strong> Connect tools like CodeSonar into the DevSecOps platform for automotive-specific compliance</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous compliance verification:</strong> Verify requirements throughout development</li>\n<li><strong>Automated evidence collection:</strong> Gather compliance artifacts as a by-product of development</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch this video to learn how to use Custom Compliance Frameworks in GitLab to create your own compliance policies. You can create compliance policies related to any standard (e.g., ISO 26262) and automatically enforce those policies in GitLab.</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/S-FQjzSyVJw?si=0UdtGNuugLPG0SLL&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>By shifting compliance left and embedding it within normal development workflows, you can maintain safety standards without sacrificing velocity. Automated checks catch issues early when they're easier and less expensive to fix, while continuous evidence collection reduces the documentation burden.</p>\n<h2>Realizing the power of embedded DevOps</h2>\n<p>Embedded development is changing fast. Teams that remain stuck in manual processes and isolated workflows will find themselves increasingly left behind, while those that embrace automated, collaborative practices will define the future of software-defined smart systems.</p>\n<p>Explore our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/embedded/workshops/embedded-devops-workshop-refactoring-to-ci\">Embedded DevOps Workshop</a> to start automating embedded development workflows with GitLab, or <a href=\"https://content.gitlab.com/viewer/0a35252831bd130f879b0725738f70ed\">watch this presentation from GitLab's Field Chief Cloud Architect</a> to learn how leading organizations are bringing hardware-in-the-loop testing into continuous integration workflows to accelerate embedded development.</p>\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://content.gitlab.com/viewer/438451cba726dd017da7b95fd0fb1b59\">Why GitLab Premium with Duo for embedded systems development?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://content.gitlab.com/viewer/87f5104c26720e2c0d73a6b377522a44\">Why GitLab Ultimate with Duo for embedded systems development?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://content.gitlab.com/viewer/e59c40099d5e3c8f9307afb27c4a923f\">More embedded development systems presentations from GitLab</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>In today’s modern software development landscape, many organizations are migrating to the cloud and adopting DevSecOps processes. However, this transition presents a significant challenge: a proliferation of tools and legacy systems not designed for modern development. To adapt these systems to DevSecOps, organizations must create integrations between multiple tools for task management, CI/CD, security, monitoring, and more. The result? Operational complexity, high maintenance costs, and disrupted collaboration between development and operations teams. Additionally, developers experience frustration as they constantly switch between different tools to complete a single development flow – from planning to production.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The complexity and operational costs of integrating multiple tools into a DevSecOps process\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2St6IpZOhWumZRBuiPh5lO/e1927a696756921dc7f8c3cb4b499702/image1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;How complex it can be to integrate multiple tools into a DevSecOps process&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>The good news is that a solution exists: A comprehensive DevSecOps platform offering a unified approach to software development.</p>\n<p>These platforms are built for organizations operating in cloud-based and DevSecOps environments, consolidating all software development stages — from code management, CI/CD processes, task management, and security to AI-driven automation — into a single platform.

      "summary": "<p>Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing DevOps and DevSecOps approaches by simplifying complex tasks, such as code creation, log analysis, and vulnerability detection.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn how LLMs work, their practical applications, and the main challenges to overcome in order to fully harness their potential.</p>\n<h2>What is an LLM?</h2>\n<p>LLMs are artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can process and generate text autonomously. They are trained by analyzing vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, enabling them to master the linguistic structures, contextual relationships, and nuances of language.</p>\n<p>LLMs are a major breakthrough in the field of AI. Their ability to process, generate, and interpret text relies on sophisticated machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. These systems do not just process individual words; they analyze complex sequences to capture the overall meaning, subtle contexts, and linguistic nuances.</p>\n<h2>How do LLMs work?</h2>\n<p>To better understand how they work, let's explore some of the key features of large language models.</p>\n<h3>Supervised and unsupervised learning</h3>\n<p>LLMs are trained using two complementary approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. These two approaches to machine learning maximize their ability to analyze and generate text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Supervised learning</strong> relies on labeled data, where each input is associated with an expected output. The model learns to associate these inputs with the correct outputs by adjusting its internal parameters to reduce prediction errors. Through this approach, the model acquires precise knowledge about specific tasks, such as text classification or named entity recognition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unsupervised learning (or machine learning)</strong>, on the other hand, does not require labeled data. The model explores large volumes of text to discover hidden structures and identify semantic relationships. The model is therefore able to learn recurring patterns, implicit grammatical rules in the text, and contextualization of sentences and concepts. This method allows LLMs to be trained on large corpora of data, greatly accelerating their progress without direct human action.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By combining these two approaches, large language models gain the advantages of both precise, human-guided learning and unlimited autonomous exploration. This complementarity allows them to develop rapidly, while continuously improving their ability to understand and generate text coherently and contextually.</p>\n<h3>Learning based on a large volume of data</h3>\n<p>LLMs are trained on billions of sentences from a variety of sources, such as news articles, online forums, technical documentation, scientific studies, and more. This variety of sources allows them to acquire a broad and nuanced understanding of natural language, ranging from everyday expressions to specialized terminology.</p>\n<p>The richness of the data used is a key factor in LLMs' performance. Each source brings different writing styles, cultural contexts, and levels of technicality.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>News articles</strong> to master informative and factual language</li>\n<li><strong>Online forums</strong> to understand specialized communities' informal conversations and technical language</li>\n<li><strong>Technical documentation and scientific studies</strong> to assimilate complex concepts and specific terminology, particularly in areas such as DevOps and DevSecOps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This diversity of content allows LLMs to recognize complex linguistic structures, interpret sentences in different contexts, and adapt to highly technical domains. In DevSecOps, this means understanding commands, configurations, security protocols, and even concepts related to the development and maintenance of computer systems.</p>\n<p>With this large-scale training, LLMs can accurately answer complex questions, write technical documentation, or identify vulnerabilities in computer systems.</p>\n<h3>Neural network architecture and &quot;deep learning&quot;</h3>\n<p>LLMs are based on advanced neural network architectures. These networks are specially designed to process large sequences of text while maintaining an accurate understanding of the context. This deep learning-based training is a major asset in the field of NLP.</p>\n<p>The best-known of these structures is the architecture of sequence-to-sequence models (transformers). This architecture has revolutionized NLP with its ability to simultaneously analyze all parts of a text, unlike sequential approaches that process words one by one.</p>\n<p>Sequence-to-sequence models excel at processing long texts. For example, in a conversation or a detailed technical document, they are able to link distant information in the text to produce precise and well-reasoned answers. This context management is essential in a DevSecOps approach, where instructions can be complex and spread over multiple lines of code or configuration steps.</p>\n<h3>Predictive text generation</h3>\n<p>When the user submits a text, query, or question, an LLM uses its predictive ability to generate the most likely sequence, based on the context provided.</p>\n<p>The model analyzes each word, studies grammatical and semantic relationships, and then selects the most suitable terms to produce a coherent and informative text. This approach makes it possible to generate precise, detailed responses adapted to the expected tone.</p>\n<p>In DevSecOps environments, this capability becomes particularly useful for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Coding assistance:</strong> generation of code blocks or scripts adapted to specific configurations</li>\n<li><strong>Technical problem solving:</strong> proposing solutions based on descriptions of bugs or errors</li>\n<li><strong>Drafting technical documentation:</strong> automatic creation of guides, manuals, or instructions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Predictive text generation thus makes it possible to automate many repetitive tasks and speed up technical teams' work.</p>\n<h2>Applications of large language models in a DevSecOps approach</h2>\n<p>With the rise of automation, LLMs have become indispensable allies for technical teams. Their ability to understand and generate text contextually enables them to effectively operate in complex environments such as <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devsecops/\">DevSecOps</a>.</p>\n<p>With their analytical power and ability to adapt to specific needs, these models offer tailored solutions to streamline processes and lighten technical teams' workload.</p>\n<p>Development teams can leverage LLMs to automatically transform functional specifications into source code.</p>\n<p>With this capability, they can perform the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>generate complex automation scripts</li>\n<li>create CI/CD pipelines tailored to specific business processes</li>\n<li>produce customized security patches</li>\n<li>generate code explanation and create documentation</li>\n<li>refactor code by improving code structure and readability without changing functionality</li>\n<li>generate tests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By relying on LLMs, teams are able to accelerate the development of their software while reducing the risk of human error.</p>\n<h3>Improved documentation and knowledge sharing</h3>\n<p>These powerful tools make it easy to create customized user manuals, API descriptions, and tutorials that are perfectly tailored to each user's level of expertise. By leveraging existing knowledge bases, LLMs create contextual answers to frequently asked questions. This enhances knowledge sharing within teams, speeds up onboarding of new members, and helps centralize best practices.</p>\n<h3>Incident management and troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>During an incident, LLMs play a crucial role in analyzing logs and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/tracing.html\">trace files</a> in real time. Thanks to their ability to cross-reference information from multiple sources, they identify anomalies and propose solutions based on similar past incidents. This approach significantly reduces diagnosis time. In addition, LLMs can automate the creation of detailed incident reports and recommend specific corrective actions.</p>\n<h3>Creating and improving CI/CD pipelines</h3>\n<p>LLMs are revolutionizing the configuration of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/cicd-pipeline/\">CI/CD pipelines</a>. They can not only help create pipelines, but also automate this process and suggest optimal configurations based on industry standards. By adapting workflows to your specific needs, they ensure perfect consistency between different development environments. Automated testing is enhanced by relevant suggestions, limiting the risk of failure. LLMs also continuously monitor the efficiency of pipelines and adjust processes to ensure smooth and uninterrupted rollout.</p>\n<h3>Security and compliance</h3>\n<p>In a DevSecOps environment, large language models become valuable allies for security and compliance. They parse the source code for potential vulnerabilities and generate detailed patch recommendations. LLMs can also monitor the application of security standards in real time, produce comprehensive compliance reports, and automate the application of security patches as soon as a vulnerability is identified. This automation enhances overall security and ensures consistent compliance with legal and industry requirements.</p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of large language models?</h2>\n<p>LLMs are radically reshaping DevOps and DevSecOps approaches, bringing substantial improvements in productivity, security, and software quality. By integrating with existing workflows, LLMs are disrupting traditional approaches by automating complex tasks and providing innovative solutions.</p>\n<h3>Improved productivity and efficiency</h3>\n<p>LLMs play a central role in improving technical teams' productivity and efficiency. By automating a wide range of repetitive tasks, they free development teams from routine operations, allowing them to focus on strategic activities with higher added value.</p>\n<p>In addition, LLMs act as intelligent technical assistants capable of instantly providing relevant code snippets, tailored to the specific context of each project. In this way, they significantly reduce research time by offering ready-to-use solutions to assist teams in their work. This targeted assistance speeds up problem solving and reduces disruptions in workflows.\nAs a result, productivity increases and projects move forward more quickly. Technical teams can take on more tasks without compromising the quality of deliverables.</p>\n<h3>Improved code quality and security</h3>\n<p>The use of large language models in software development is a major lever for improving both code quality and application security. With their advanced analytical capabilities, LLMs can scan source code line by line and instantly detect syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and potential vulnerabilities. Their ability to recognize defective code allows them to recommend appropriate fixes that comply with industry best practices.</p>\n<p>LLMs also play a key preventive role. They excel at identifying complex security flaws that are often difficult for humans to detect. By analyzing dependencies, they can flag obsolete or vulnerable libraries and recommend more secure, up-to-date versions. This approach contributes to maintaining a secure environment that complies with current security standards.</p>\n<p>Beyond fixing existing errors, LLMs offer improvements by suggesting optimized coding practices and project structures. They can generate code that meets the most advanced security standards from the earliest stages of development.</p>\n<h3>Accelerating development lifecycles</h3>\n<p>Large language models play a key role in accelerating software development lifecycles by automating key tasks that would otherwise tie up valuable human resources. Complex and repetitive tasks, such as writing functions, creating unit tests, or implementing standard components, are automated in a matter of moments.</p>\n<p>LLMs also speed up the validation phase with their ability to suggest complete and appropriate test cases. They ensure broader test coverage in less time, reducing the risk of errors and enabling early detection of anomalies. This preventive approach shortens the correction cycle and limits delays related to code quality issues.</p>\n<p>By simplifying technical tasks and providing fast and tailored solutions, large language models enable businesses to respond to market demands in a more agile way. This acceleration of the development lifecycle results in more frequent updates, faster iterations, and a better ability to adapt products to users' changing needs.</p>\n<p>Development lifecycles are becoming shorter, providing a critical strategic advantage in an increasingly demanding technology landscape.</p>\n<h2>What are the challenges of using LLMs?</h2>\n<p>Despite their many benefits, large language models have certain limitations that require careful management. Their effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the data used during their training and regular updates to their knowledge bases. In addition, issues related to algorithmic bias, data security, and privacy can arise, exposing companies to operational and legal risks. Rigorous human oversight remains essential in order to ensure the reliability of results, maintain regulatory compliance, and prevent critical errors.</p>\n<h3>Data privacy and security</h3>\n<p>Training LLMs relies on large volumes of data, often from diverse sources, raising questions about the protection of confidential information. Sensitive data shared with cloud platforms can therefore be exposed to potential breaches. This is of particular concern to companies operating in regulated sectors.</p>\n<p>In Europe, where strict regulations like GDPR govern data management, many companies are reluctant to transfer their information to external services. Regulatory requirements, coupled with the fear of unauthorized exploitation of sensitive data, have led some companies to opt for self-hosted solutions to maintain complete control over their systems.</p>\n<p>Providers like GitLab have put in place robust security guarantees, such as intentional non-retention of personal data and end-to-end encryption. However, this may not be enough for the most demanding customers, who prefer complete control of their environments. Implementing hybrid or on-premises solutions then becomes a strategic necessity to meet the security requirements of certain companies.</p>\n<p>Learn more about GitLab Duo Self-Hosted by clicking on the image below to access our product tour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.navattic.com/gitlab-duo-self-hosted\"><img alt=\"GitLab Duo Self-Hosted tour\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/75hcBwFQD6fIkujdi4q3e0/c93bdc1d6873e9aaf78c26289f1971d1/Screenshot_2025-05-29_at_8.29.30%C3%A2__AM.png\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Accuracy and reliability</h3>\n<p>Although large language models are capable of producing impressive results, their performance is not infallible. They can produce incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent answers. This inaccuracy becomes particularly problematic in the context of critical tasks such as generating security code or analyzing sensitive data.</p>\n<p>In addition, LLMs operate on the basis of probabilistic models, which means that they do not truly &quot;understand&quot; the content they process, but produce predictions based on statistical probabilities. This can lead to technically incorrect or even dangerous recommendations when used without human validation.</p>\n<p>To avoid these pitfalls, it is essential to maintain constant oversight and establish rigorous validation processes. The results provided by LLMs must always be reviewed by humans before being integrated into critical systems.</p>\n<p>A strategy of regular model updates, combined with proactive human oversight, can reduce errors and gradually improve the reliability of results.</p>\n<h2>How GitLab uses LLMs for GitLab Duo features</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a> harnesses the power of large language models to transform DevSecOps processes by integrating AI-powered capabilities throughout the software development lifecycle.

      "summary": "<p>AI is shaping up to be one of the most transformational technologies of our lifetimes and will change how we live and work just like the PC, the internet, and the smartphone did. The launch of ChatGPT was a seminal moment in the evolution of AI, and since then, AI’s adoption has accelerated. According to “<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32966/w32966.pdf\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The rapid adoption of Generative AI. Bick, Blandin, &amp; Deming (2024</a>)”, AI is being adopted at twice the rate of the PC and internet at a similar point in their evolution.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI adoption\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-AI-Agent-blog-adoption.png\" /></p>\n<p>Not just adoption, the rate of innovation in AI has been faster than anything we have seen before. So where is AI headed?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, let us start by looking at how other transformational technologies have evolved throughout history. Take the Internet for example – it started with the infrastructure - with routers and network switches. But the true inflection point came with the emergence of platform capabilities, such as web browsers and HTML, which allowed people to build and use applications like search engines, e-commerce, and social media.</p>\n<p>If you look at the PC, microprocessors and memory and other infrastructure components came first. But what triggered the massive adoption was the creation of a platform – WinTel, which provided a standardized environment for developing and running PC applications. Same with the smartphones; the infrastructure started first with modems and cell towers, but it really took off when a platform enabled the creation and use of applications.</p>\n<p>AI will follow a similar <strong>IPA</strong> (<strong>I</strong>nfrastructure -&gt; <strong>P</strong>latform -&gt; <strong>A</strong>pplication) model, with the innovation moving from Infrastructure (e.g. GPU) to Platforms (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gen-ai\">DigitalOcean GenAI Platform</a>) and Applications (e.g. Copilots), and <strong>AI agents</strong> are going to accelerate this transformation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI evolution\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-evolution2.png\" /></p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-ai-agents\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-ai-agents\">What are AI agents?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-ai-agents\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>In essence, an <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/ai-agents\">AI agent </a>is a piece of software that can act like humans – take input, reason about things, and perform actions. Agents are really four sequences of primitives. The agent gets a command from the user to perform some action, the agent then gets the information it needs by acquiring data from the outside world, it then reasons and plans how to get the job done, and finally it performs the actions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"ai agents\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-understanding-agents.png\" /></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\">AI agents will transform businesses</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Agents will drive a massive automation of work.Consider the example of a customer service agent today. Many of the calls that such an agent handles can be handled by an AI agent. An average call interaction handled by a human agent that takes about 10 minutes today costs around $3^, while an AI agent can do that for one cent^^. Not just that,  the quality of these AI models is improving exponentially and the cost of AI is decreasing by 10X YoY. So as you factor in the progress over the next few years, the conclusion is inevitable - agents will be automating or assisting with a lot of the “human work”. That means, businesses of all kinds will have no option but to reinvent themselves with AI agents in order to serve their customers in the best and most cost effective way possible.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, annual US salaries total approximately $200 billion for HR, $330 billion for IT, and $1.1 trillion for sales &amp; marketing, and as a lot of enterprise workflows get automated, the cloud and AI TAM will increase by hundreds of billions of dollars as businesses deploy agents to automate enterprise work.</p>\n<p>At DigitalOcean, we will fully participate in this TAM expansion by enabling customers to build and deploy agents through our GenAI platform.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"agentic AI TAM\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-cloud-growth.png\" /></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\">Agentic Cloud - AI agents transforming the cloud</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Given that agents will touch every enterprise workflow, it is fair to ask “how will agents change the cloud”? Indeed, we are at an inflection point for the cloud due to two emerging paradigm shifts: 1) Natural language as code, and 2) agents automating human work. The first will change how developers interact with the cloud, while the second will automate many DevOps/CloudOps and other cloud workflows. Like in previous transformations, there will be winners and losers. The winners will be the ones who use the new paradigms to reinvent themselves, while the losers will be the ones who do not change.</p>\n<p>At DigitalOcean, we will be at the forefront of reinventing the cloud by embedding agentic automation into our services. Let me illustrate how we are applying the Agentic cloud paradigm to reimagine web hosting. <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudways</a> is a web hosting software from DigitalOcean that is available on multiple clouds - DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP, Vultr, and Linode, Cloudways was recently ranked as the No. 1  web hosting software by CNET, and is one of the most popular web hosting applications for WordPress, which powers more than 40% of websites.</p>\n<p>Customers tell us that dealing with system issues (disk usage, DDOS, etc.) is a significant pain point in web hosting and they often spend several hours a month debugging and fixing such issues. Today, DigitalOcean receives more than 600,000 customer support requests a year for hosting system issues, with each of these support requests spanning 40 minutes on average. Therefore, we asked the question - “How would Cloudways have dealt with system issues if AI and agents were available when it was first built”? The answer was pretty obvious – Cloudways would use agents to autonomously rootcause and fix these issues, and enable customers to interact in natural language to gain insight about these issues. So, we set out to do exactly that by embedding SRE (system reliability) agents inside Cloudways that can take input from users in English and autonomously debug and fix system issues.</p>\n<p>We launched <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/cloudways-ai-copilot.php\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudways AI agent</a> – one of the most sophisticated uses of GenAI in the industry - in private preview with about 250 customers in Q1 ‘25. As shown in the video below, Cloudways AI agent provides troubleshooting insights and 1-click automated issue resolution. The user only needs to click the alert when issues arise and the AI agent instantly explains the issues and provides remediation steps. And with a single click, AI jumps into action and fixes the issues automatically. Users no longer need to muck around with code, and all the interactions are done in natural language. What used to take an hour now just takes a minute, saving businesses thousands of dollars a year^^^.</p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW2298unVLs\" target=\"_blank\">View YouTube video</a>\n\n<p>We will be releasing the General Availability (GA) very soon and are encouraged by the incredible feedback from early customers - “Cloudways Copilot has been a game-changer”; “It is the first good implementation of AI I’ve seen”; “It has saved us countless hours”; “It is incredibly fast, accurate, and intuitive; “ The insights it provides are spot on and the recommended steps have been 100% correct every time.”</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cloudways AI quotes\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-AI-agent-blog-quotes.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is only the beginning. We are going to embed AI agents in all of our services, providing customers a truly differentiated cloud experience. As an agentic cloud, DigitalOcean - the simplest, scalable and approachable cloud – gets even simpler, more scalable and approachable. We believe we are uniquely positioned to lead the next wave in reimagining the cloud and I will discuss more in a future blog.</p>\n<p>^ Based on U.S. average customer service salary of $20/hr for a 10-minute call.</p>\n<p>^^ Based on agent pricing of $1 per million tokens.</p>\n<p>^^^ Based on average customer spend of $200 per month on these tasks.</p>\n</details>",

Here are a few reasons we recommend examining your cloud setup regularly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>They support business growth: As your business evolves, your cloud infrastructure must evolve with it. A cloud architecture review helps you align your current environment with your business goals, helping to ensure your cloud is positioned to support where you are today, where you’re heading, and the outcomes you need to achieve.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They improve performance and security: Regular reviews can find hidden problems that can slow you down or make you less secure. Downtime isn’t just inconvenient, it’s costly. A strong, resilient cloud architecture helps you avoid downtime and keeps your business running smoothly, no matter what comes your way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They help you save on costs: Cloud reviews can help you make sure your setup is running as cost-efficiently as possible and that you’re getting your money’s worth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\">Tips to boost cloud performance and security</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Optimizing cloud performance and security is about delivering faster user experiences, protecting sensitive data, and avoiding waste. Whether you’re scaling your app or managing costs, a well-tuned cloud setup gives you speed, stability, and peace of mind. Here are five things you can check to make your cloud faster, more reliable and better protected:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Audit your virtual machines and Kubernetes nodes: Many businesses use more virtual machines or Kubernetes nodes than they need. This wastes money. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-droplet-vm\">Choose the right  virtual machines</a> and Kubernetes node pools to make sure they match how much you’re using. If you find machines that aren’t being used much, make them smaller or move workloads to a smaller instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use load balancers and autoscaling: Traffic to your business can change quickly. If you have too much infrastructure, you waste money. If you have too little, your app will run poorly. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/autoscale-workloads-using-droplet-autoscale-pools\">Autoscaling</a> adjusts your infrastructure based on traffic. This way, you don’t pay for resources you don’t need, and your app runs well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Streamline networking with VPCs: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/vpc-vs-vpn\">Virtual private clouds</a> (VPCs) can make internal communication faster and cheaper. VPCs also improve security by keeping your traffic away from the public internet. Set up VPCs for internal services that talk to each other a lot. This reduces delay and helps protect your internal resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monitor usage and set up alerts: Even with a good setup, problems will happen. Alerts can warn you before small issues become big headaches. Use alerts to track things like CPU usage, memory usage, and data transfers. You can also set up alerts for billing to warn you about unexpected costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Back up smarter: Losing data or taking a long time to recover can hurt your business. Have a good backup plan. Back up your databases and file systems regularly. Automate the backup process and test your restores to make sure they work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\">Tips to save money and grow efficiently</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Here are five more things you can do to save money and grow your business:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/data-storage-management-strategies\">Consolidate and optimize storage</a>: Unused storage costs money. Check your storage usage regularly to avoid waste. Delete old snapshots and unused disks to free up resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/managed-vs-self-managed-databases\">Use managed services</a>: Running your own databases can take time and introduce errors. Managed services can handle scaling, security, and uptime for you, helping to save you time and money. Migrate any self-hosted databases to managed databases offered by your cloud provider—we recommend DigitalOcean. ;)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automate deployments: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/streamline-deployment-through-ci-cd-on-digitalocean-s-app-platform\">Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</a> (CI/CD) can reduce errors and simplify rollbacks. Infrastructure as code makes your environment easy to reproduce and build on. Use tools like Terraform and GitHub actions to automate your infrastructure and deployments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review data costs: Egress data costs can add up, especially if you use a lot of media or APIs. Find ways to reduce unnecessary outbound traffic. Use <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/what-is-a-cdn\">CDNs</a> to cache content closer to where your users are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do a monthly cost vs. performance review: Make time each month to review your <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/understand-your-cloud-bill\">cloud bill</a> and performance metrics to help you make sure you’re spending money where it matters most. Track your spending and performance to make informed decisions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\">How DigitalOcean experts help: A real-world example</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Similar to many DigitalOcean customers, a mid-sized software company wanted to serve customers globally with low delay and high performance. They also wanted to make sure their app and database were reliable. They used a containerized deployment and wanted a CI/CD workflow. Our DigitalOcean team knew exactly how to help. Here’s their optimized cloud architecture following our review discussions:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Cloud architecture example\" src=\"https://sailtosuccess.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Cloud%20architecture%20example.png\" /><figcaption>Cloud architecture example</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To meet the company’s particular needs, DigitalOcean cloud infrastructure experts suggested the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/load-balancers\">Global load balancer</a>: Directs traffic to the closest available region. Regional Internal Load Balancers distribute traffic within each region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes\">Managed Kubernetes</a>: Provides a fully managed control plane with autoscaling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-mysql\">Managed Database</a>: Offers a primary and standby node for high availability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/container-registry\">Container registry</a>: Stores Docker images for automated pipelines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/vpc\">VPC peering</a>: Secures connections between the app and database.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By following these suggestions, the customer created a more reliable, secure, and cost-effective cloud setup. They were able to create an architecture diagram that helped visualize their infrastructure and share it with their team to build a common understanding. Like a captain charting a course, they used this clarity to make informed changes, optimizing their setup to catch the winds of today’s business demands and stay steady on course for future growth.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"optimize-your-cloud-to-empower-your-business\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimize-your-cloud-to-empower-your-business\">Optimize your cloud to empower your business</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimize-your-cloud-to-empower-your-business\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>To successfully journey across the ocean of challenges awaiting your business, you need a cloud setup that helps and doesn’t hurt.

      "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/hatch\">Hatch</a> is DigitalOcean’s global program for startups, which provides selected growing technology companies with credits and discounts on computing resources so they can build and scale with less worry  about costs. By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program helps enable startups to build solutions that move society forward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ontramobility.com\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ontra Mobility</a>, a Y Combinator startup, transforms communities by developing data-driven tools that help cities and transit agencies plan and operate more efficient, equitable, and sustainable transportation systems, focusing on optimizing networks and improving first-and-last mile access through on-demand ridesharing. We sat down with CTO Connor Riley, who chose DigitalOcean for its simple, managed infrastructure so they can focus on making public transit more accessible. The Hatch program provided credits and resources that helped support their mission.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"solving-real-world-problems-comes-with-real-world-challenges\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#solving-real-world-problems-comes-with-real-world-challenges\">Solving real-world problems comes with real-world challenges</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#solving-real-world-problems-comes-with-real-world-challenges\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>During their PhD programs at Georgia Institute of Technology, Riley and his co-founder Anthony Trasatti worked with their academic advisor, Pascal Van Hentenryck, to optimize public transit, which serves as a vital lifeline for many. Working closely with MARTA in Atlanta, GA, they developed techniques for network design optimization, special events scheduling, and dispatching algorithms for on-demand ridesharing. These projects powered on-demand ridesharing pilots MARTA Reach and CAT SMART in Savannah, Georgia.</p>\n<p>Getting adoption for a product that serves public agencies is as much of a battle as building the product itself. Since many residents rely on public transportation, establishing trust with transit agencies is essential before they’ll risk adopting new products that could impact municipal residents. Despite these hurdles, they’re undeterred: they’ve already gained traction with a number of customers, including conducting a microtransit planning project in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>“It’s a challenge that we’re really excited to face, right? We want transit agencies to trust us to help them analyze their networks, plan their network changes, and operate their systems. We’re always working every day to continue to build that trust and expand our capabilities.&quot;</p>\n<p>— Connor Riley, CTO @ Ontra Mobility</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"simplifying-building-with-digitalocean-and-hatch\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#simplifying-building-with-digitalocean-and-hatch\">Simplifying building with DigitalOcean and Hatch</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#simplifying-building-with-digitalocean-and-hatch\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>When building city-shaping transportation technology, having simple, managed infrastructure like DigitalOcean’s allows the team to stay focused on their core mission. Using an abundance of DigitalOcean products such as <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes\">Managed Kubernetes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces\">Spaces</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/container-registry\">Container Registry</a> and integrations with Temporal, Argo CD, GitOps, and LetsEncrypt, Ontra Mobility is able to build a fully comprehensive planning and operations platform on our platform. Riley believes DigitalOcean’s simplicity allows the team to focus on their application itself:</p>\n<p>“As a two person startup, DigitalOcean is perfect for what we need it to be. There’s a simplicity it offers but that simplicity has never gotten in the way of what we’re trying to do. That takes a huge burden off of us when we’re thinking more about the app and not about the infrastructure as much. I’ve been very happy with DigitalOcean.”</p>\n<p>The Hatch program has also been a lifeline for the team. Taking advantage of their credits, priority support, and the Hatch community, the Ontra Mobility team is building their product and acquiring customers, without worrying about cloud costs.</p>\n<p>“Because we have our credits, we didn’t have to worry about [costs] and we didn’t have to factor it into our burn rate. It has been a huge help. I’ve [also] definitely gotten some help from the Hatch community and DigitalOcean’s support [team]. When you’re two people and you’re only used to being a software developer or researcher, and now you have to figure out infrastructure, having that support and community is a comfort.”</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"full-speed-ahead\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#full-speed-ahead\">Full speed ahead</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#full-speed-ahead\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>While building Ontra Mobility, Riley emphasizes that one of the most rewarding aspects of the startup journey has been building a platform that makes their AI planning tools intuitive and user-friendly. They’re able to learn directly from the public transit agencies that they work with to build better products that will serve everyday riders.</p>\n<p>In the future, Ontra Mobility looks to develop sophisticated AI-power optimization models, which will improve vehicle scheduling, dispatching, and more. They’re excited to begin tackling these challenges to help empower communities with frictionless and equitable transportation.</p>\n<p>By joining the Hatch program, selected startups receive*:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Up to $100,000 in compute credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privilege GPU Droplet pricing of $1.90/GPU/hour</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3 months of free GPU usage for select startups</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complimentary premium support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GenAI usage with Hatch credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to a thriving community of founders and builders</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Note that GPU Droplet usage will not be covered by Hatch compute credits.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/10551\">#10551</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">@rumstead</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/#default-resourceexclusions-configurations\">Ignore differences on high churn controller managed resources</a> like those from Cert Manager, Kyverno, Cilium, and Kubernetes.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>. Since we <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/announcing-argo-cd-v3-small-but-mighty-df05c0b39ad6\">announced Argo CD 3.0</a> many <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/help-us-shape-the-future-of-argo-cd-3-0-ebc670413312\">have offered feedback, contributions, and ideas</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*49UiTK-B6pgcG9ZfTjqYew.png\" /><figcaption>More than 94 contributors for Argo CD 3.0</figcaption></figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a0b933f4e58f\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-cd-v3-0-release-candidate-a0b933f4e58f\">Argo CD v3.0 Release Candidate</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months. If you are interested in contributing a canary step plugin to the community, simply open an issue under argo-rollouts requesting an argoproj-labs repository to host your plugin.</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a></p><h3>Analysis Consecutive Success Limit</h3><p>This provides the <em>inverse</em> of what an analysis currently does. The main use case for this is to allow users to wait on a condition (in a step analysis especially) to hold, before proceeding to the next step.</p><p>Here is an example analysis:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: AnalysisTemplate<br />metadata:<br />  name: success-rate<br />spec:<br />  args:<br />  - name: service-name<br />  metrics:<br />  - name: success-rate<br />    interval: 1m<br />    successCondition: result[0] &lt;= 0.95<br />    consecutiveSuccessLimit: 3<br />    provider:<br />      prometheus:<br />        address: http://prometheus.example.com:9090<br />        query: |<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;,response_code!~&quot;5.*&quot;}[1m]<br />          )) /<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;}[1m]<br />          ))</pre><p>You can find more information in the documentation found <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/analysis/#consecutivesuccesslimit-and-failurelimit\">here</a> .</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/y-rabie\">Youssef Rabie</a></p><h3>Other Features</h3><ul><li>New Prometheus metric: build_info (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3591\">#3591</a>)</li><li>Enable pprof profiling support (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3769\">#3769</a>)</li><li>Allow specifying full annotations for Nginx canary (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3671\">#3671</a>)</li><li>Credentials to download plugin (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3905\">#3905</a>)</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><p>We had 36 labeled bug fixes in this release some of the area’s of focus for bugs have been around Rollouts getting stuck progressing and better verification of not causing any outage during a rollout. So, if you have experienced any of these issue test this release out and let us know how it behaves.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>This releases big feature was around step plugins, I can’t wait to see what this feature empowers end users to create. Feel free to share in the CNCF Argo Rollouts Slack channel and open an issue if you would like a plugin repo on argoproj-labs.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

      "summary": "<h3><strong>Argo CD v2.14</strong></h3><p>We are thrilled to announce the release of Argo CD 2.14, packed with new features, bug fixes, and documentation updates to enhance your experience.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in Argo CD 2.14. As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

This feature allows you to group information from multiple places (for example a public Helm chart plus your local values file) to form a single Argo CD application. Initial support for defining multiple sources was already added in Argo CD version 2.6, and the support for CLI was added in 2.11. The UI still assumed the application to have a single source and certain CLI features like rollback were not yet supported for an application with multiple sources.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, rollback of a multiple source application is now possible via both Argo CD UI and CLI.</p><p>In addition to the rollback feature, a new Sources tab has been added to the Application Details page, enabling users to manage (view and edit) the sources of an application.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mj0F_f8U8TQMhzvN\" /></figure><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/keithchong\">Keith Chong</a> (Red Hat) and <a href=\"https://github.com/JorTurFer\">Jorge Turrado</a> for implementing these features.</p><h3>Project Scoped Repository Credential Improvements</h3><p>Currently, multiple repository credentials sharing the same URL is not allowed by the Argo CD API. If the credentials are added directly to the argocd namespace, argocd-server won’t return an error, but this still does not work since the first secret that matches a repository URL is the one that gets returned, and the order is also undefined.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, Argo CD will allow multiple app projects to have the ability to have separate repository credentials having the same URL.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">Blake Pettersson</a> (Akuity) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Add labels for Kubernetes events</h3><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, users will be able to expose application labels on k8s events generated by Argo CD. When the events are created for Applications that have specific label keys defined in `resource.includeEventLabelKeys`, the controller will attach the matching labels to the events. This connection will make it simpler to filter or process the events based on the applications using these labels.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/svghadi\">Siddhesh Ghadi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Consistent Sharding Algorithm</h3><p>Argo CD provides the capability to employ sharding for different Argo CD application controllers. This allows you to assign specific clusters to specific controllers to distribute the load across the different shards.</p><p>The existing sharding algorithms, including the legacy method and the round-robin algorithm, have shown limitations in maintaining optimal load distribution and minimizing unnecessary cluster-to-shard assignment changes.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, a new sharding algorithm named “consistent-hashing” is introduced which reduces Cluster-to-Shard Assignment Changes and optimizes resource utilization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/akram\">Akram Ben Aissi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p>Here are some other new changes that made it into the release</p><ul><li>Updates to git client for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17566\">resolving semantic versioning tags</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/thepabloaguilar\">Pablo Aguilar</a> from Stone Payments)</li><li>Application Set Git Generator now supports <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18545\">GPG signature verification</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/ishitasequeira\">Ishita Sequeira</a> from Red Hat)</li><li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18250\">ls-remote request fail</a> metric (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>)</li><li>Add new<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/pull/560\"> annotation argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Force=true</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/kkk777-7\">Kota Kimura</a> from CyberAgent, Inc.)</li><li>Add support for setting a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17728\">grpc message size as an environment variable</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pavel Kostohrys</a> from Codefresh)</li><li>Display the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18116\">list of dependent resources</a> in the delete popup (by <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a> from Intuit)</li><li>Remove support for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/13203\">old tracking label</a> <em>applications.argoproj.io/app-name</em> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">Soumya Ghosh Dastidar</a> from Akuity)</li><li>Add support for<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18484\"> fish shell completion</a> to Argo CD CLI (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Sn0rt\">Sn0rt</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18657\">Skip calling git fetch</a> if the commit to checkout exists locally (by <a href=\"https://github.com/shady-canva\">Shady Rafehi</a>)</li></ul><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.12.0-rc1\">release notes</a>, and <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.11-2.12/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

      "summary": "<p>According to Istio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-policy\">support policy</a>, minor releases like 1.24 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.26 in this case). <a href=\"https://istio.io/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/\">Istio 1.26 was released on May 8th, 2025</a>, and support for 1.24 will end on June 19th, 2025.</p>\n<p>At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.24, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio (1.26.1). If you don&rsquo;t do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.</p>\n<p>We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.</p>",

Please note that <em><code>EnvoyFilter</code> is not currently supported for any existing Istio version with waypoint proxies</em>. While it may be possible to use <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with waypoints in limited scenarios, its use is not supported, and is actively discouraged by the maintainers. The alpha API may break in future releases as it evolves. We expect official support will be provided at a later date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"customization-of-resources-provisioned-by-the-gateway-api\">Customization of resources provisioned by the Gateway API</h3>\n<p>When you create a Gateway or a waypoint using the Gateway API, a <code>Service</code> and a <code>Deployment</code> are created automatically. It has been a common request to allow customization of these objects, and that is now supported in Istio 1.26 by specifying a <code>ConfigMap</code> of parameters. If configuration for a <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code> or <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code> is provided, those resources will automatically be created also. <a href=\"/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Learn more about customizing the generated Gateway API resources.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"new-gateway-api-support\">New Gateway API support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/\"><code>TCPRoute</code></a> is now available in waypoints, allowing TCP traffic shifting in ambient mode.</p>\n<p>We also added support for the experimental <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtlspolicy/\"><code>BackendTLSPolicy</code></a> and started the implementation of <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtrafficpolicy/\"><code>BackendTrafficPolicy</code></a> in Gateway API 1.3, which will eventually set retry constraints.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-the-new-kubernetes-clustertrustbundle\">Support for the new Kubernetes <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code></h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve added experimental support for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#cluster-trust-bundles\">the experimental <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> resource in Kubernetes</a>, allowing support for the new method of bundling a certificate and its root of trust into a single object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plus-much-much-more\">Plus much, much more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>istioctl analyze</code> can now run specific checks!</li>\n<li>The CNI node agent no longer runs in the <code>hostNetwork</code> namespace by default, reducing the chance of port conflicts with other services running on a host!</li>\n<li>Required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources and <code>cniBinDir</code> values are set automatically when installing on GKE!</li>\n<li>An <code>EnvoyFilter</code> can now match a <code>VirtualHost</code> on a domain name!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read about these and more in the full <a href=\"/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/change-notes/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"catch-up-with-the-istio-project\">Catch up with the Istio project</h2>\n<p>If you only check in with us when we have a new release, you might have missed that <a href=\"/blog/2025/ztunnel-security-assessment/\">we published a security audit on ztunnel</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2025/ambient-performance/\">we compared performance of ambient mode throughput vs. running in-kernel</a>, or that <a href=\"/blog/2025/istio-at-kubecon-eu/\">we had a major presence at KubeCon EU</a>.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the CNI agent to no longer require <code>hostNetwork</code>, enhancing compatibility. Dynamic switching to the host network is now performed as needed. The previous behavior can be temporarily restored by setting the <code>ambient.shareHostNetworkNamespace</code> field in the <code>istio-cni</code> chart. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54726\">Issue #54726</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> iptables binary detection to validate baseline kernel support and to prefer <code>nft</code> when both legacy and <code>nft</code> are available but neither has existing rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the default value of maximum connections accepted per socket event to 1 to improve performance. To revert to the previous behavior, set <code>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SOCKET_EVENT_LOOP</code> to zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability for <code>EnvoyFilter</code> to match a <code>VirtualHost</code> by domain name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> initial support for the experimental Gateway API features <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> and <code>XBackendTrafficPolicy</code>. These are disabled by default and require setting <code>PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for referencing <code>ConfigMap</code>s, in addition to <code>Secret</code>s, for <code>DestinationRule</code> TLS in <code>SIMPLE</code> mode — useful when only a CA certificate is required.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> customization support for <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Gateway API automated deployments</a>. This applies to both Istio <code>Gateway</code> types (ingress and egress) and Istio Waypoint <code>Gateway</code> types (ambient waypoints). Users can now customize generated resources such as <code>Service</code>, <code>Deployment</code>, <code>ServiceAccount</code>, <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code>, and <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new environment variable <code>ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT</code> for <code>istiod</code>. When set to <code>false</code>, it disables automatic attachment of Gateway API resources to existing gateway deployments. By default, this is <code>true</code> to maintain the current behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure retry host predicates using the Retry API (<code>retry_ignore_previous_hosts</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying backoff intervals during retries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for using <code>TCPRoute</code> in waypoint proxies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured a <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where FQDNs did not work in a <code>WorkloadEntry</code> using ambient mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a case where <code>ReferenceGrants</code> did not function when mTLS was enabled on a Gateway listener.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55623\">Issue #55623</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio failed to correctly retrieve <code>allowedRoutes</code> for a sandboxed waypoint.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56010\">Issue #56010</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>ServiceEntry</code> endpoints were leaked when a pod was evicted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54997\">Issue #54997</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the listener address was duplicated for dual stack services with IPv6 priority.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56151\">Issue #56151</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added</strong> experimental support for the v1alpha1 <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> API. This can be enabled by setting <code>values.pilot.env.ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API=true</code>. Ensure the corresponding feature gates are enabled in your cluster; see <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3257-cluster-trust-bundles\">KEP-3257</a> for details.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43986\">Issue #43986</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>omit_empty_values</code> field in the <code>EnvoyFileAccessLog</code> provider via the Telemetry API.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54930\">Issue #54930</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> environment variable <code>PILOT_SPAWN_UPSTREAM_SPAN_FOR_GATEWAY</code>, which separates tracing spans for server and client gateways. This currently defaults to <code>false</code>, but will become the default in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a warning message for use of deprecated telemetry providers Lightstep and OpenCensus.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54002\">Issue #54002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the installation experience on GKE. When <code>global.platform=gke</code> is set, required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources are deployed automatically. When installing via <code>istioctl</code>, this setting is also auto-enabled if GKE is detected. Additionally, the <code>cniBinDir</code> is now configured appropriately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the <code>ztunnel</code> Helm chart to not assign resource names to <code>.Release.Name</code>, defaulting instead to <code>ztunnel</code>. This reverts a change introduced in Istio 1.25.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for setting the <code>reinvocationPolicy</code> in the revision-tag webhook when installing Istio via <code>istioctl</code> or Helm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure the service <code>loadBalancerClass</code> in the Gateway Helm chart.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39079\">Issue #39079</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a values <code>ConfigMap</code> that stores both the user-provided Helm values and the merged values after applying profiles for the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for reading header values from <code>istiod</code> environment variables.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53408\">Issue #53408</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a configurable <code>updateStrategy</code> for the <code>ztunnel</code> and <code>istio-cni</code> Helm charts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in the sidecar injection template that incorrectly removed existing init containers when both traffic interception and native sidecar were disabled.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54562\">Issue #54562</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> missing <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> labels on gateway pods when <code>--set networkGateway</code> is used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54909\">Issue #54909</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a problem where setting <code>replicaCount=0</code> in the <code>istio/gateway</code> Helm chart caused the <code>replicas</code> field to be omitted instead of explicitly set to <code>0</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55092\">Issue #55092</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue that caused file-based certificate references (e.g., from <code>DestinationRule</code> or <code>Gateway</code>) to fail when using SPIRE as the CA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> the deprecated <code>ENABLE_AUTO_SNI</code> flag and associated code paths.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--locality</code> parameter on <code>istioctl experimental workload group create</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54022\">Issue #54022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to run specific analyzer checks using the <code>istioctl analyze</code> command.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--tls-server-name</code> parameter to <code>istioctl create-remote-secret</code>, allowing the <code>tls-server-name</code> to be set in the generated kubeconfig. This ensures successful TLS connections when the <code>server</code> field is overridden with a gateway proxy hostname.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>envVarFrom</code> field in the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl analyze</code> reported an unknown annotation <code>sidecar.istio.io/statsCompression</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52082\">Issue #52082</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an error that blocked installation when <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> or <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> was omitted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>istioctl</code> ignored the <code>tag</code> fields under <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways</code> and <code>egressGateways</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl waypoint delete</code> could remove a non-waypoint Gateway resource when a name was specified.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55235\">Issue #55235</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl experimental describe</code> did not respect the <code>--namespace</code> flag.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55243\">Issue #55243</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug that prevented simultaneous generation of <code>istio.io/waypoint-for</code> and <code>istio.io/rev</code> labels when creating a waypoint proxy using <code>istioctl</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55437\">Issue #55437</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl admin log</code> could not modify the log level for <code>ingress status</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55741\">Issue #55741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a validation failure when <code>reconcileIptablesOnStartup: true</code> was set in the <code>istioctl</code> YAML configuration.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55347\">Issue #55347</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

<code>XDS_HEADER_</code>) that can be added to CA requests for different purposes, such as routing to appropriate external <code>istiod</code>s.\nIstio sidecar proxy, router, and waypoint now support this feature.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55064\">Issue #55064</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> corner cases where <code>istio-cni</code> might block its own upgrade. Added fallback logging (in case agent is down) to a fixed-size node-local log file.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55215\">Issue #55215</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code>&rsquo;s <code>WaypointAccepted</code> status condition was not being updated to reflect the resolution of a <code>GatewayClass</code> target reference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>WaypointAccepted</code> status condition for <code>AuthorizationPolicies</code> that referenced a <code>GatewayClass</code> and did not reside in the root namespace was not being updated with the correct reason and message.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where proxy memory goes up with gRPC streaming services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing changes to <code>ExternalName</code> services to sometimes be skipped due to a cache eviction bug.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a regression where the SDS <code>ROOTCA</code> resource included only a single root certificate, even if the control plane\nwas configured with both an active root and a passive root certificate that was introduced in 1.25.1.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55793\">Issue #55793</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

<code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure.

There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The Prometheus Team is proud to announce the availability of Prometheus Version 3.0-beta!\nYou can download it <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.0\">here</a>.\nAs is traditional with a beta release, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend users install Prometheus 3.0-beta on critical production systems, but we do want everyone to test it out and find bugs.</p>\n<p>In general, the only breaking changes are the removal of deprecated feature flags. The Prometheus team worked hard to ensure backwards-compatibility and not to break existing installations, so all of the new features described below build on top of existing functionality. Most users should be able to try Prometheus 3.0 out of the box without any configuration changes.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>With over 7500 commits in the 7 years since Prometheus 2.0 came out there are too many new individual features and fixes to list, but there are some big shiny and breaking changes we wanted to call out. We need everyone in the community to try them out and report any issues you might find.\nThe more feedback we get, the more stable the final 3.0 release can be.</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-09-11/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view, and will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.\nSince the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars, created timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. More details can be found <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus intends to be the default choice for storing OpenTelemetry metrics, and 3.0 includes some big new features that makes it even better as a storage backend for OpenTelemetry metrics data.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8</h4>\n<p>By default, Prometheus will allow all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names, as well as label values as has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8, metric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "published": "2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>. In the spirit of End User confidence, we decided to track their results while they position themselves as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.</p>\n<h3>aaS</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronosphere</li>\n<li>Grafana Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>New Relic</li>\n<li>Sysdig Monitor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: As Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on Cortex just like Grafana Cloud, we expect them to pass after the next update cycle.</p>\n<h2>Agent/Collector</h2>\n<h3>Passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafana Agent 0.19.0</li>\n<li>OpenTelemetry Collector 0.37.0</li>\n<li>Prometheus 2.30.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Telegraf 1.20.2</li>\n<li>Timber Vector 0.16.1</li>\n<li>VictoriaMetrics Agent 1.67.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: We tested Vector 0.16.1 instead of 0.17.0 because there are no binary downloads for 0.17.0 and our test toolchain currently expects binaries.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
