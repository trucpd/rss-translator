      "summary": "<p>As cloud-native architectures continue to evolve, Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for deploying complex, distributed systems. One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern—a technique that allows developers to extend application functionality without diving deep into source code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-origins-of-the-sidecar-pattern\">The origins of the sidecar pattern</h2>\n<p>Think of a sidecar like a trusty companion motorcycle attachment. Historically, IT infrastructures have always used auxiliary services to handle critical tasks. Before containers, we relied on background processes and helper daemons to manage logging, monitoring, and networking. The microservices revolution transformed this approach, making sidecars a structured and intentional architectural choice.\nWith the rise of microservices, the sidecar pattern became more clearly defined, allowing developers to offload specific responsibilities from the main service without altering its code. Service meshes like Istio and Linkerd have popularized sidecar proxies, demonstrating how these companion containers can elegantly handle observability, security, and traffic management in distributed systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-implementation\">Kubernetes implementation</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\">sidecar containers</a> operate within\nthe same Pod as the main application, enabling communication and resource sharing.\nDoes this sound just like defining multiple containers along each other inside the Pod? It actually does, and\nthis is how sidecar containers had to be implemented before Kubernetes v1.29.0, which introduced\nnative support for sidecars.\nSidecar containers can now be defined within a Pod manifest using the <code>spec.initContainers</code> field. What makes\nit a sidecar container is that you specify it with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>. You can see an example of this below, which is a partial snippet of the full Kubernetes manifest:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">initContainers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>logshipper<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>alpine:latest<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">restartPolicy</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Always<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>[<span style=\"color: #b44;\">'sh'</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'-c'</span>,<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'tail -F /opt/logs.txt'</span>]<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">volumeMounts</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>data<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">mountPath</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>/opt<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>That field name, <code>spec.initContainers</code> may sound confusing. How come when you want to define a sidecar container, you have to put an entry in the <code>spec.initContainers</code> array? <code>spec.initContainers</code> are run to completion just before main application starts, so they’re one-off, whereas sidecars often run in parallel to the main app container. It’s the <code>spec.initContainers</code> with <code>restartPolicy:Always</code> which differs classic <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/\">init containers</a> from Kubernetes-native sidecar containers and ensures they are always up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-embrace-or-avoid-sidecars\">When to embrace (or avoid) sidecars</h2>\n<p>While the sidecar pattern can be useful in many cases, it is generally not the preferred approach unless the use case justifies it. Adding a sidecar increases complexity, resource consumption, and potential network latency. Instead, simpler alternatives such as built-in libraries or shared infrastructure should be considered first.</p>\n<p><strong>Deploy a sidecar when:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>You need to extend application functionality without touching the original code</li>\n<li>Implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring or security</li>\n<li>Working with legacy applications requiring modern networking capabilities</li>\n<li>Designing microservices that demand independent scaling and updates</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Proceed with caution if:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resource efficiency is your primary concern</li>\n<li>Minimal network latency is critical</li>\n<li>Simpler alternatives exist</li>\n<li>You want to minimize troubleshooting complexity</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"four-essential-multi-container-patterns\">Four essential multi-container patterns</h2>\n<h3 id=\"init-container-pattern\">Init container pattern</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Init container</strong> pattern is used to execute (often critical) setup tasks before the main application container starts. Unlike regular containers, init containers run to completion and then terminate, ensuring that preconditions for the main application are met.</p>\n<p><strong>Ideal for:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Preparing configurations</li>\n<li>Loading secrets</li>\n<li>Verifying dependency availability</li>\n<li>Running database migrations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The init container ensures your application starts in a predictable, controlled environment without code modifications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambassador-pattern\">Ambassador pattern</h3>\n<p>An ambassador container provides Pod-local helper services that expose a simple way to access a network service. Commonly, ambassador containers send network requests on behalf of a an application container and\ntake care of challenges such as service discovery, peer identity verification, or encryption in transit.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect when you need to:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Offload client connectivity concerns</li>\n<li>Implement language-agnostic networking features</li>\n<li>Add security layers like TLS</li>\n<li>Create robust circuit breakers and retry mechanisms</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"configuration-helper\">Configuration helper</h3>\n<p>A <em>configuration helper</em> sidecar provides configuration updates to an application dynamically, ensuring it always has access to the latest settings without disrupting the service. Often the helper needs to provide an initial\nconfiguration before the application would be able to start successfully.</p>\n<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fetching environment variables and secrets</li>\n<li>Polling configuration changes</li>\n<li>Decoupling configuration management from application logic</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"adapter-pattern\">Adapter pattern</h3>\n<p>An <em>adapter</em> (or sometimes <em>façade</em>) container enables interoperability between the main application container and external services. It does this by translating data formats, protocols, or APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transforming legacy data formats</li>\n<li>Bridging communication protocols</li>\n<li>Facilitating integration between mismatched services</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<p>While sidecar patterns offer tremendous flexibility, they're not a silver bullet. Each added sidecar introduces complexity, consumes resources, and potentially increases operational overhead. Always evaluate simpler alternatives first.\nThe key is strategic implementation: use sidecars as precision tools to solve specific architectural challenges, not as a default approach. When used correctly, they can improve security, networking, and configuration management in containerized environments.\nChoose wisely, implement carefully, and let your sidecars elevate your container ecosystem.</p>",

This discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large production environment.</p>\n<p>Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge.\nThere are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests.\nMore often than not, bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.\nActually, many bugs are found by users after shipping the release,\neven in the upstream kube-scheduler.</p>\n<p>Having a development or sandbox environment for testing the scheduler — or, indeed, any Kubernetes controllers — is a common practice.\nHowever, this approach falls short of capturing all the potential scenarios that might arise in a production cluster\nbecause a development cluster is often much smaller with notable differences in workload sizes and scaling dynamics.\nIt never sees the exact same use or exhibits the same behavior as its production counterpart.</p>\n<p>The kube-scheduler-simulator aims to solve those problems.\nIt enables users to test their scheduling constraints, scheduler configurations,\nand custom plugins while checking every detailed part of scheduling decisions.\nIt also allows users to create a simulated cluster environment, where they can test their scheduler\nwith the same resources as their production cluster without affecting actual workloads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-of-the-kube-scheduler-simulator\">Features of the kube-scheduler-simulator</h2>\n<p>The kube-scheduler-simulator’s core feature is its ability to expose the scheduler's internal decisions.\nThe scheduler operates based on the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/\">scheduling framework</a>,\nusing various plugins at different extension points,\nfilter nodes (Filter phase), score nodes (Score phase), and ultimately determine the best node for the Pod.</p>\n<p>The simulator allows users to create Kubernetes resources and observe how each plugin influences the scheduling decisions for Pods.\nThis visibility helps users understand the scheduler’s workings and define appropriate scheduling constraints.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of the simulator web frontend that shows the detailed scheduling results per node and per extension point\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2025-04-07-kube-scheduler-simulator/simulator.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<h4>The simulator web frontend</h4>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Inside the simulator, a debuggable scheduler runs instead of the vanilla scheduler.\nThis debuggable scheduler outputs the results of each scheduler plugin at every extension point to the Pod’s annotations like the following manifest shows\nand the web front end formats/visualizes the scheduling results based on these annotations.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "summary": "<p>As the release of Kubernetes v1.33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.33 release and is subject to change before the final release date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kubernetes-api-removal-and-deprecation-process\">The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes project has a well-documented <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">deprecation policy</a> for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed.

While the original Endpoints API was simple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network endpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making the original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation only impacts those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts; these users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with more details on the deprecation implications and migration plans in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h3>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>, the <code>status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field will be removed in v1.33. This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate. As it has been disabled by default since v1.31, the v1.33 release will remove this field entirely.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4004\">KEP-4004: Deprecate status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h3>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density by allowing containers to use the Node’s networking namespace.\nThe original implementation landed as alpha with v1.26, but as it faced unexpected containerd behaviours,\nand alternative solutions were available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated\nKEP. We're expecting to see support fully removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3503\">KEP-3503: Host network support for Windows pods</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"featured-improvement-of-kubernetes-v1-33\">Featured improvement of Kubernetes v1.33</h2>\n<p>As authors of this article, we picked one improvement as the most significant change to call out!</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs today is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security improvement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for Pods. This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and now is set to be a part of v1.33, where the feature is available by default.</p>\n<p>This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify <code>pod.spec.hostUsers</code> to opt in. As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/03/12/kubernetes-1-30-upcoming-changes/\">v1.30 sneak peek blog</a>, this is an important milestone for mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127: Support User Namespaces in pods</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"selected-other-kubernetes-v1-33-improvements\">Selected other Kubernetes v1.33 improvements</h2>\n<p>The following list of enhancements is likely to be included in the upcoming v1.33 release. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>When provisioning a Pod, you can use various resources such as Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. Scalability requirements may need horizontal scaling by updating the Pod replica count, or vertical scaling by updating resources allocated to Pod’s container(s). Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It opens up various possibilities of vertical scale-up for stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup that is eventually reduced once the initial setup is complete. This was released as alpha in v1.27, and is expected to land as beta in v1.33.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-s-resourceclaim-device-status-graduates-to-beta\">DRA’s ResourceClaim Device Status graduates to beta</h3>\n<p>The <code>devices</code> field in ResourceClaim <code>status</code>, originally introduced in the v1.32 release, is likely to graduate to beta in v1.33. This field allows drivers to report device status data, improving both observability and troubleshooting capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, reporting the interface name, MAC address, and IP addresses of network interfaces in the status of a ResourceClaim can significantly help in configuring and managing network services, as well as in debugging network related issues. You can read more about ResourceClaim Device Status in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#resourceclaim-device-status\">Dynamic Resource Allocation: ResourceClaim Device Status</a> document.</p>\n<p>Also, you can find more about the planned enhancement in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4817\">KEP-4817: DRA: Resource Claim Status with possible standardized network interface data</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ordered-namespace-deletion\">Ordered namespace deletion</h3>\n<p>This KEP introduces a more structured deletion process for Kubernetes namespaces to ensure secure and deterministic resource removal. The current semi-random deletion order can create security gaps or unintended behaviour, such as Pods persisting after their associated NetworkPolicies are deleted. By enforcing a structured deletion sequence that respects logical and security dependencies, this approach ensures Pods are removed before other resources. The design improves Kubernetes’s security and reliability by mitigating risks associated with non-deterministic deletions.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5080\">KEP-5080: Ordered namespace deletion</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enhancements-for-indexed-job-management\">Enhancements for indexed job management</h3>\n<p>These two KEPs are both set to graduate to GA to provide better reliability for job handling, specifically for indexed jobs. <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850</a> provides per-index backoff limits for indexed jobs, which allows each index to be fully independent of other indexes. Also, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998</a> extends Job API to define conditions for making an indexed job as successfully completed when not all indexes are succeeded.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> and <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-know-more\">Want to know more?</h2>\n<p>New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes.

      "summary": "<p>Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature.\nIt offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by\nswapping out unused data,\nshielding nodes from system-level memory spikes,\npreventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits,\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2400-node-swap/README.md#user-stories\">much more</a>.\nAs a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project\nhas invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes.</p>\n<p>The 1.22 release <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/09/run-nodes-with-swap-alpha/\">introduced</a> Alpha support\nfor configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.\nLater, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many\nnew improvements.\nIn the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way\nto GA in the near future.</p>\n<p>Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.\nThis was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization\nwhen swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial\ndesign of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory\nwas detected on a node.</p>\n<p>In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage.\nThis provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time.\nHowever, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</p>\n<p>In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta.\nThe Beta version was a drastic leap forward.\nNot only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way,\nbut it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests\nwhich include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more.\nIt also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the <code>LimitedSwap</code> behavior\nwhich sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation\nsupport (through the <code>/metrics/resource</code> endpoint) and Summary API for\nVerticalPodAutoscalers (through the <code>/stats/summary</code> endpoint), and more.</p>\n<p>Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA.\nCurrently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability,\nenhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback,\npolishing the feature and making it stable.\nFor example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods\ncannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use.\nIn addition, the <code>UnlimitedSwap</code> behavior was removed since it might compromise\nthe node's health.\nSecret content protection against swapping has also been introduced\n(see relevant <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#memory-backed-volumes\">security-risk section</a> for more info).</p>\n<p>To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled\nis more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings.\nThat said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning.\nIn the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways,\nsuch as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the <code>failSwapOn</code>\nfield must be set to <code>false</code> on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated\n<code>--fail-swap-on</code> command line flag must be deactivated.</p>\n<p>It is possible to configure the <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code> option to define the\nmanner in which a node utilizes swap memory.\nFor instance,</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># this fragment goes into the kubelet's configuration file</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">memorySwap</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">swapBehavior</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>LimitedSwap<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The currently available configuration options for <code>swapBehavior</code> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>NoSwap</code> (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap.

Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) × totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,\nincluding better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,\nbetter debug abilities and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn

      "summary": "<p>Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases\">released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities</a> that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/\">ingress-nginx</a>, you should take action immediately to protect your users and data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">Ingress</a> is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/\">ingress controller</a> uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs.</p>\n<p>Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters!</p>\n<p>Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn’t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vulnerabilities-patched-today\">Vulnerabilities Patched Today</h2>\n<p>Four of today’s ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\">Secrets</a> that are accessible to ingress-nginx. By default, ingress-nginx has access to all Secrets cluster-wide, so this can often lead to complete cluster takeover by any user or entity that has permission to create an Ingress.</p>\n<p>The most serious of today’s vulnerabilities, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131009\">CVE-2025-1974</a>, rated <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\">9.8 CVSS</a>, allows anything on the Pod network to exploit configuration injection vulnerabilities via the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx. This makes such vulnerabilities far more dangerous: ordinarily one would need to be able to create an Ingress object in the cluster, which is a fairly privileged action. When combined with today’s other vulnerabilities, <strong>CVE-2025-1974 means that anything on the Pod network has a good chance of taking over your Kubernetes cluster, with no credentials or administrative access required</strong>. In many common scenarios, the Pod network is accessible to all workloads in your cloud VPC, or even anyone connected to your corporate network! This is a very serious situation.</p>\n<p>Today, we have <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases\">released ingress-nginx v1.12.1 and v1.11.5</a>, which have fixes for all five of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-next-steps\">Your next steps</h2>\n<p>First, determine if your clusters are using ingress-nginx. In most cases, you can check this by running <code>kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx</code> with cluster administrator permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are using ingress-nginx, make a plan to remediate these vulnerabilities immediately.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The best and easiest remedy is to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/\">upgrade to the new patch release of ingress-nginx</a>.</strong> All five of today’s vulnerabilities are fixed by installing today’s patches.</p>\n<p>If you can’t upgrade right away, you can significantly reduce your risk by turning off the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have installed ingress-nginx using Helm\n<ul>\n<li>Reinstall, setting the Helm value <code>controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you have installed ingress-nginx manually\n<ul>\n<li>delete the ValidatingWebhookconfiguration called <code>ingress-nginx-admission</code></li>\n<li>edit the <code>ingress-nginx-controller</code> Deployment or Daemonset, removing <code>--validating-webhook</code> from the controller container’s argument list</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you turn off the Validating Admission Controller feature as a mitigation for CVE-2025-1974, remember to turn it back on after you upgrade. This feature provides important quality of life improvements for your users, warning them about incorrect Ingress configurations before they can take effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-thanks-and-further-reading\">Conclusion, thanks, and further reading</h2>\n<p>The ingress-nginx vulnerabilities announced today, including CVE-2025-1974, present a serious risk to many Kubernetes users and their data. If you use ingress-nginx, you should take action immediately to keep yourself safe.</p>\n<p>Thanks go out to Nir Ohfeld, Sagi Tzadik, Ronen Shustin, and Hillai Ben-Sasson from Wiz for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities, and for working with the Kubernetes SRC members and ingress-nginx maintainers (Marco Ebert and James Strong) to ensure we fixed them effectively.</p>\n<p>For further information about the maintenance and future of ingress-nginx, please see this <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/13002\">GitHub issue</a> and/or attend <a href=\"https://kccnceu2025.sched.com/event/1tcyc/\">James and Marco’s KubeCon/CloudNativeCon EU 2025 presentation</a>.</p>\n<p>For further information about the specific vulnerabilities discussed in this article, please see the appropriate GitHub issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131005\">CVE-2025-24513</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131006\">CVE-2025-24514</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131007\">CVE-2025-1097</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131008\">CVE-2025-1098</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131009\">CVE-2025-1974</a></p>",

      "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000",
      "summary": "<p><strong>Authors</strong>: Daniel Vega-Myhre (Google), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google), Kevin Hannon (Red Hat)</p>\n<p>In this article, we introduce <a href=\"https://jobset.sigs.k8s.io/\">JobSet</a>, an open source API for\nrepresenting distributed jobs. The goal of JobSet is to provide a unified API for distributed ML\ntraining and HPC workloads on Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-jobset\">Why JobSet?</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes community’s recent enhancements to the batch ecosystem on Kubernetes has attracted ML\nengineers who have found it to be a natural fit for the requirements of running distributed training\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>Large ML models (particularly LLMs) which cannot fit into the memory of the GPU or TPU chips on a\nsingle host are often distributed across tens of thousands of accelerator chips, which in turn may\nspan thousands of hosts.</p>\n<p>As such, the model training code is often containerized and executed simultaneously on all these\nhosts, performing distributed computations which often shard both the model parameters and/or the\ntraining dataset across the target accelerator chips, using communication collective primitives like\nall-gather and all-reduce to perform distributed computations and synchronize gradients between\nhosts.</p>\n<p>These workload characteristics make Kubernetes a great fit for this type of workload, as efficiently\nscheduling and managing the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of compute\nresources is an area where it shines.</p>\n<p>It is also very extensible, allowing developers to define their own Kubernetes APIs, objects, and\ncontrollers which manage the behavior and life cycle of these objects, allowing engineers to develop\ncustom distributed training orchestration solutions to fit their needs.</p>\n<p>However, as distributed ML training techniques continue to evolve, existing Kubernetes primitives do\nnot adequately model them alone anymore.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the landscape of Kubernetes distributed training orchestration APIs has become\nfragmented, and each of the existing solutions in this fragmented landscape has certain limitations\nthat make it non-optimal for distributed ML training.</p>\n<p>For example, the KubeFlow training operator defines custom APIs for different frameworks (e.g.\nPyTorchJob, TFJob, MPIJob, etc.); however, each of these job types are in fact a solution fit\nspecifically to the target framework, each with different semantics and behavior.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Job API fixed many gaps for running batch workloads, including Indexed\ncompletion mode, higher scalability, Pod failure policies and Pod backoff policy to mention a few of\nthe most recent enhancements. However, running ML training and HPC workloads using the upstream Job\nAPI requires extra orchestration to fill the following gaps:</p>\n<p>Multi-template Pods : Most HPC or ML training jobs include more than one type of Pods. The different\nPods are part of the same workload, but they need to run a different container, request different\nresources or have different failure policies. A common example is the driver-worker pattern.</p>\n<p>Job groups : Large scale training workloads span multiple network topologies, running across\nmultiple racks for example. Such workloads are network latency sensitive, and aim to localize\ncommunication and minimize traffic crossing the higher-latency network links. To facilitate this,\nthe workload needs to be split into groups of Pods each assigned to a network topology.</p>\n<p>Inter-Pod communication : Create and manage the resources (e.g. <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services\">headless\nServices</a>) necessary to establish\ncommunication between the Pods of a job.</p>\n<p>Startup sequencing : Some jobs require a specific start sequence of pods; sometimes the driver is\nexpected to start first (like Ray or Spark), in other cases the workers are expected to be ready\nbefore starting the driver (like MPI).</p>\n<p>JobSet aims to address those gaps using the Job API as a building block to build a richer API for\nlarge-scale distributed HPC and ML use cases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-jobset-works\">How JobSet Works</h2>\n<p>JobSet models a distributed batch workload as a group of Kubernetes Jobs. This allows a user to\neasily specify different pod templates for different distinct groups of pods (e.g. a leader,\nworkers, parameter servers, etc.).</p>\n<p>It uses the abstraction of a ReplicatedJob to manage child Jobs, where a ReplicatedJob is\nessentially a Job Template with some desired number of Job replicas specified. This provides a\ndeclarative way to easily create identical child-jobs to run on different islands of accelerators,\nwithout resorting to scripting or Helm charts to generate many versions of the same job but with\ndifferent names.</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"JobSet Architecture\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/23/introducing-jobset/jobset_diagram.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Some other key JobSet features which address the problems described above include:</p>\n<p>Replicated Jobs : In modern data centers, hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs allocated in\nislands of homogenous accelerators connected via a specialized, high bandwidth network links. For\nexample, a user might provision nodes containing a group of hosts co-located on a rack, each with\nH100 GPUs, where GPU chips within each host are connected via NVLink, with a NVLink Switch\nconnecting the multiple NVLinks. TPU Pods are another example of this: TPU ViperLitePods consist of\n64 hosts, each with 4 TPU v5e chips attached, all connected via ICI mesh. When running a distributed\ntraining job across multiple of these islands, we often want to partition the workload into a group\nof smaller identical jobs, 1 per island, where each pod primarily communicates with the pods within\nthe same island to do segments of distributed computation, and keeping the gradient synchronization\nover DCN (data center network, which is lower bandwidth than ICI) to a bare minimum.</p>\n<p>Automatic headless service creation, configuration, and lifecycle management : Pod-to-pod\ncommunication via pod hostname is enabled by default, with automatic configuration and lifecycle\nmanagement of the headless service enabling this.</p>\n<p>Configurable success policies : JobSet has configurable success policies which target specific\nReplicatedJobs, with operators to target “Any” or “All” of their child jobs. For example, you can\nconfigure the JobSet to be marked complete if and only if all pods that are part of the “worker”\nReplicatedJob are completed.</p>\n<p>Configurable failure policies : JobSet has configurable failure policies which allow the user to\nspecify a maximum number of times the JobSet should be restarted in the event of a failure. If any\njob is marked failed, the entire JobSet will be recreated, allowing the workload to resume from the\nlast checkpoint. When no failure policy is specified, if any job fails, the JobSet simply fails.</p>\n<p>Exclusive placement per topology domain : JobSet allows users to express that child jobs have 1:1\nexclusive assignment to a topology domain, typically an accelerator island like a rack. For example,\nif the JobSet creates two child jobs, then this feature will enforce that the pods of each child job\nwill be co-located on the same island, and that only one child job is allowed to schedule per\nisland. This is useful for scenarios where we want to use a distributed data parallel (DDP) training\nstrategy to train a model using multiple islands of compute resources (GPU racks or TPU slices),\nrunning 1 model replica in each accelerator island, ensuring the forward and backward passes\nthemselves occur within a single model replica occurs over the high bandwidth interconnect linking\nthe accelerators chips within the island, and only the gradient synchronization between model\nreplicas occurs across accelerator islands over the lower bandwidth data center network.</p>\n<p>Integration with Kueue : Users can submit JobSets via <a href=\"https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/\">Kueue</a> to\noversubscribe their clusters, queue workloads to run as capacity becomes available, prevent partial\nscheduling and deadlocks, enable multi-tenancy, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-use-case\">Example use case</h2>\n<h3 id=\"distributed-ml-training-on-multiple-tpu-slices-with-jax\">Distributed ML training on multiple TPU slices with Jax</h3>\n<p>The following example is a JobSet spec for running a TPU Multislice workload on 4 TPU v5e\n<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm#slices\">slices</a>. To learn more about\nTPU concepts and terminology, please refer to these\n<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm\">docs</a>.</p>\n<p>This example uses <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html\">Jax</a>, an ML framework with\nnative support for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation targeting TPU chips via\n<a href=\"https://github.com/openxla\">OpenXLA</a>. However, you can also use\n<a href=\"https://pytorch.org/xla/release/2.3/index.html\">PyTorch/XLA</a> to do ML training on TPUs.</p>\n<p>This example makes use of several JobSet features (both explicitly and implicitly) to support the\nunique scheduling requirements of TPU multislice training out-of-the-box with very little\nconfiguration required by the user.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080;

      "summary": "<p>In our ongoing SIG Spotlight series, we dive into the heart of the Kubernetes project by talking to\nthe leaders of its various Special Interest Groups (SIGs). This time, we focus on\n<strong><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#apps-special-interest-group\">SIG Apps</a></strong>,\nthe group responsible for everything related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on\nKubernetes. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandipanpanda\">Sandipan Panda</a>\n(<a href=\"https://www.devzero.io/\">DevZero</a>) had the opportunity to interview <a href=\"https://github.com/soltysh\">Maciej\nSzulik</a> (<a href=\"https://defenseunicorns.com/\">Defense Unicorns</a>) and <a href=\"https://github.com/janetkuo\">Janet\nKuo</a> (<a href=\"https://about.google/\">Google</a>), the chairs and tech leads of\nSIG Apps. They shared their experiences, challenges, and visions for the future of application\nmanagement within the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introductions\">Introductions</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: Hello, could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role, and your journey\nwithin the Kubernetes community that led to your current roles in SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: Hey, my name is Maciej, and I’m one of the leads for SIG Apps. Aside from this role, you\ncan also find me helping\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli#readme\">SIG CLI</a> and also being one of\nthe Steering Committee members. I’ve been contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various\nareas, including controllers, apiserver, and kubectl.</p>\n<p><strong>Janet</strong>: Certainly! I'm Janet, a Staff Software Engineer at Google, and I've been deeply involved\nwith the Kubernetes project since its early days, even before the 1.0 launch in 2015. It's been an\namazing journey!</p>\n<p>My current role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. My\njourney with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the Deployment API and adding\nrolling update functionalities. I naturally gravitated towards SIG Apps and became increasingly\ninvolved. Over time, I took on more responsibilities, culminating in my current leadership roles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-apps\">About SIG Apps</h2>\n<p><em>All following answers were jointly provided by Maciej and Janet.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: For those unfamiliar, could you provide an overview of SIG Apps' mission and objectives?\nWhat key problems does it aim to solve within the Kubernetes ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>As described in our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-apps/charter.md#scope\">charter</a>, we cover a\nbroad area related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes. That, in\nshort, means we’re open to each and everyone showing up at our bi-weekly meetings and discussing the\nups and downs of writing and deploying various applications on Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of the most significant projects or initiatives currently being undertaken\nby SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>At this point in time, the main factors driving the development of our controllers are the\nchallenges coming from running various AI-related workloads. It’s worth giving credit here to two\nworking groups we’ve sponsored over the past years:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-batch\">The Batch Working Group</a>, which is\nlooking at running HPC, AI/ML, and data analytics jobs on top of Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-serving\">The Serving Working Group</a>, which\nis focusing on hardware-accelerated AI/ML inference.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"best-practices-and-challenges\">Best practices and challenges</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: SIG Apps plays a crucial role in developing application management best practices for\nKubernetes. Can you share some of these best practices and how they help improve application\nlifecycle management?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Implementing <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">health checks and readiness probes</a>\nensures that your applications are healthy and ready to serve traffic, leading to improved\nreliability and uptime. The above, combined with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing\nsolutions, will provide insights into your application's behavior, enabling you to identify and\nresolve issues quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/\">Auto-scale your application</a> based\non resource utilization or custom metrics, optimizing resource usage and ensuring your\napplication can handle varying loads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use Deployment for stateless applications, StatefulSet for stateful applications, Job\nand CronJob for batch workloads, and DaemonSet for running a daemon on each node. Use\nOperators and CRDs to extend the Kubernetes API to automate the deployment, management, and\nlifecycle of complex applications, making them easier to operate and reducing manual\nintervention.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of the common challenges SIG Apps faces, and how do you address them?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest challenge we’re facing all the time is the need to reject a lot of features, ideas, and\nimprovements. This requires a lot of discipline and patience to be able to explain the reasons\nbehind those decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: How has the evolution of Kubernetes influenced the work of SIG Apps? Are there any\nrecent changes or upcoming features in Kubernetes that you find particularly relevant or beneficial\nfor SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>The main benefit for both us and the whole community around SIG Apps is the ability to extend\nkubernetes with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">Custom Resource Definitions</a>\nand the fact that users can build their own custom controllers leveraging the built-in ones to\nachieve whatever sophisticated use cases they might have and we, as the core maintainers, haven’t\nconsidered or weren’t able to efficiently resolve inside Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contributing-to-sig-apps\">Contributing to SIG Apps</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What opportunities are available for new contributors who want to get involved with SIG\nApps, and what advice would you give them?</strong></p>\n<p>We get the question, &quot;What good first issue might you recommend we start with?&quot; a lot :-) But\nunfortunately, there’s no easy answer to it. We always tell everyone that the best option to start\ncontributing to core controllers is to find one you are willing to spend some time with. Read\nthrough the code, then try running unit tests and integration tests focusing on that\ncontroller. Once you grasp the general idea, try breaking it and the tests again to verify your\nbreakage. Once you start feeling confident you understand that particular controller, you may want\nto search through open issues affecting that controller and either provide suggestions, explaining\nthe problem users have, or maybe attempt your first fix.</p>\n<p>Like we said, there are no shortcuts on that road; you need to spend the time with the codebase to\nunderstand all the edge cases we’ve slowly built up to get to the point where we are. Once you’re\nsuccessful with one controller, you’ll need to repeat that same process with others all over again.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: How does SIG Apps gather feedback from the community, and how is this feedback\nintegrated into your work?</strong></p>\n<p>We always encourage everyone to show up and present their problems and solutions during our\nbi-weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#meetings\">meetings</a>. As long\nas you’re solving an interesting problem on top of Kubernetes and you can provide valuable feedback\nabout any of the core controllers, we’re always happy to hear from everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: Looking ahead, what are the key focus areas or upcoming trends in application management\nwithin Kubernetes that SIG Apps is excited about? How is the SIG adapting to these trends?</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely the current AI hype is the major driving factor; as mentioned above, we have two working\ngroups, each covering a different aspect of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of your favorite things about this SIG?</strong></p>\n<p>Without a doubt, the people that participate in our meetings and on\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-apps\">Slack</a>, who tirelessly help triage issues, pull\nrequests and invest a lot of their time (very frequently their private time) into making kubernetes\ngreat!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>SIG Apps is an essential part of the Kubernetes community, helping to shape how applications are\ndeployed and managed at scale. From its work on improving Kubernetes' workload APIs to driving\ninnovation in AI/ML application management, SIG Apps is continually adapting to meet the needs of\nmodern application developers and operators. Whether you’re a new contributor or an experienced\ndeveloper, there’s always an opportunity to get involved and make an impact.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more or contributing to SIG Apps, be sure to check out their <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps\">SIG\nREADME</a> and join their bi-weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#meetings\">meetings</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/sig-apps\">SIG Apps Mailing List</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-apps\">SIG Apps on Slack</a></li>\n</ul>",

Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a\nbit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin:</strong> Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I\nwork for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes &amp; etcd &amp; CSI\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md\">Container Storage Interface</a>)\nbecause of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes &amp; etcd\n(and also CSI) since 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>James:</strong> Hey team, I’m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a\nSpecialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the\nKubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project\nneeded help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that\n&quot;you come for the technology, and stay for the people&quot;: for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a\nwonderful journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Marek:</strong> Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring\na stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG\nInstrumentation</a>, where I\ncreated and led the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/\">Kubernetes Structured Logging effort</a>.<br />\nI'm still the main project lead for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/\">Kubernetes Metrics Server</a>,\nproviding crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,\nright around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most\nscalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's\nhistory. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia:</strong> Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd\nmaintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)\nand GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and\netcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my\njob, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more\nimportantly, the awesome open source community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-a-kubernetes-special-interest-group-sig\">Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG)</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is\na very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,\nserving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and\nreliability issues. <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2023/introducing-sig-etcd/\">Creating a dedicated SIG</a>\nallowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,\nand ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just\ndescribed being addressed, and to what extent?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and\ntransparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals</a>\nand PRRs (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">Production Readiness Reviews</a>,\nwhich has improved our feature development and release cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from\nbecoming a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like\n<a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a> and <a href=\"https://testgrid.k8s.io/\">TestGrid</a>. For large projects like\netcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear\ntools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also\nhelp etcd.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation\nfor addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes\necosystem.</p>\n<p>The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I’d like\nto highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd\ncontributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had\ngreater collaboration with other SIGs like <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Scalability</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Testing</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle\">SIG Cluster Lifecycle</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes\necosystem. The formation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-etcd-operator/README.md\">etcd Operator Working Group</a>\nunder the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful\ncollaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within\nKubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and\ncommunity involvement in recent months?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>James</strong>: Yes -- as showing in our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/23/prs-authors-repository-groups?orgId=1&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000\">unique PR author data</a>\nwe recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Unique PR author data stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Additionally, looking at our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-metric=contributions&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;var-country_name=All&amp;var-company_name=All&amp;var-company=all\">overall contributions across all etcd project repositories</a>\nwe are also observing a positive trend showing a resurgence in etcd project activity:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overall contributions stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The road ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current\npriorities for SIG etcd?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Reliability is always top of mind -– we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also\nworking on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making\netcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of\ncourse, scaling -– we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure\nnot only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve\nthe understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points\nthat the community cares about the most.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: SIG API Machinery, for sure – they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're\nconstantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle – etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,\nso we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG\nScalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the\nevolving cloud native landscape?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The\ncloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how\ncan they get involved?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md#meetings\">SIG etcd meetings</a>,\nfollow discussions on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev\">etcd-dev mailing list</a>, and check\nout our <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues\">GitHub issues</a>. We're always looking for people to\nreview proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: I love this question 😀 .

      "summary": "<p>A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature\nin Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of\n1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the\niptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent\nkernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even\nonce nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the <em>default</em>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-1-data-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latency</h2>\n<p>The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and\nhas problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large\nKubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.</p>\n<p>In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a\nnumber of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of\nServices and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top\nlevel of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service\nIP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code># If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain\n# KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O\n# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT\n# etc...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK\n</code></pre><p>This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel\nto check it against all of the Service rules is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number\nof Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and\nthe worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection\nincreases (with the difference between best-case, average, and\nworst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP\naddress appears earlier or later in the <code>KUBE-SERVICES</code> chain).</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like\nthis is to have a <em>single</em> rule, using a &quot;verdict map&quot; to do the\ndispatch:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>table ip kube-proxy {\n# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.\nmap service-ips {\ntype ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict\ncomment \"ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic\"\nelements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,\n172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,\n172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,\n... }\n}\n# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an\n# element in the map. (This rule says, \"construct a tuple from the\n# destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look\n# that tuple up in \"service-ips\"; and if there's a match, execute the\n# associated verdict.)\nchain services {\nip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips\n}\n...\n}\n</code></pre><p>Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly <strong>O(1)</strong> map lookup,\npacket processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster\nsize, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/nftables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the\niptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000\nServices, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as\nthe p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000\nService cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for\nnftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few\nmicroseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to\nsquint to see the nftables results!:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-2-control-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latency</h2>\n<p>While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are\ngreat, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often\nkeeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:\nthe time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when\nServices and their endpoints change.</p>\n<p>With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a\nwhole (actual rules, plus associated data) is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the combined\nnumber of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables\nbackend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of\nthousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of\niptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving\nkube-proxy so that it could skip updating <em>most</em> of the unchanged\nrules in each update, but the limitations of <code>iptables-restore</code> as an\nAPI meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's\n<strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller\nconstant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can\nstill be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's <code>minSyncPeriod</code> config\noption to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to\npush iptables updates.</p>\n<p>The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and\nwhen kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the\nupdate is only <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services and endpoints that\nhave changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of\nServices and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each\nnftables-using component to have its own private table also means that\nthere is no global lock contention between components like with\niptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much\nmore efficiently than with iptables.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-nftables\">Why <em>not</em> nftables?</h2>\n<p>All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump\nright into using the nftables backend for now.</p>\n<p>First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit\ntests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in\nthe real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as\nmuch real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise\nthat it is as stable and bug-free.</p>\n<p>Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;\ncurrently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of\nbugs in early versions of the <code>nft</code> command line tool, you should not\nrun kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier\nthan 1.0.0) version of <code>nft</code> in the host filesystem (or else\nkube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables\non the system).</p>\n<p>Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such\nas the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet\nsupport kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the\ndocumentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components\nto see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they\nwill not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or\noverride kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether\nkube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability\nand monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data\nfor kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in\niptables mode.</p>\n<p>Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%\ncompatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old\nkube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less\nperformant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that\nchanging the default would be a compatibility break. Since the\nnftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad\ndefaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In\nparticular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only\nreachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable\non all IPs, including <code>127.0.0.1</code>, with iptables mode.) The\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">kube-proxy documentation</a> has more information about this, including\ninformation about metrics you can look at to determine if you are\nrelying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration\noptions are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-out-nftables-mode\">Trying out nftables mode</h2>\n<p>Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to\npass <code>--proxy-mode nftables</code> to kube-proxy (or set <code>mode: nftables</code> in\nyour kube-proxy config file).</p>\n<p>If you are using kubeadm to set up your cluster, the kubeadm\ndocumentation explains <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/#customizing-kube-proxy\">how to pass a <code>KubeProxyConfiguration</code> to\n<code>kubeadm init</code></a>. You can also <a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#kube-proxy-mode\">deploy nftables-based clusters with\n<code>kind</code></a>.</p>\n<p>You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to\nnftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the\nkube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting\nin nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs\nrules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs\nmode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-plans\">Future plans</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, while nftables is now the <em>best</em> kube-proxy mode,\nit is not the <em>default</em>, and we do not yet have a plan for changing\nthat. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.</p>\n<p>The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main\nadvantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of\nthe IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes\n(for example, the fact that the <code>kube-ipvs0</code> device needs to have\n<em>every</em> Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of\nKubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement\nusing IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have\ndifferent endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a\nlocal or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same\nperformance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of\nthe downsides:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy ipvs-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/ipvs-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use\nvarious other IPVS functionality, like alternative &quot;schedulers&quot; for\nbalancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,\nbecause kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS\nschedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the\nproxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic\nmore cleverly.)</p>\n<p>While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop\nthe IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people\nwho are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode\ninstead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in\nnftables mode that you can't work around).</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md\">KEP-3866: Add an nftables-based kube-proxy backend</a>&quot; has the\nhistory of the new feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yOGHb2HjslY?si=6O4PVJu7fGpReo1U\">How the Tables Have Turned: Kubernetes Says Goodbye to IPTables</a>&quot;,\nfrom KubeCon/CloudNativeCon North America 2024, talks about porting\nkube-proxy and Calico from iptables to nftables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uYo2O3jbJLk?si=py2AXzMJZ4PuhxNg\">From Observability to Performance</a>&quot;, from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon\nNorth America 2024.

Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a <code>Deployment</code>\nor <code>DaemonSet</code>, may not be able to schedule.</p>\n<p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting <code>Node</code> objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-not-ready-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3>\n<p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#node-kubernetes-io-not-ready\">Kubernetes documentation describes</a> the <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p>\n<p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-recommendations\">Our Recommendations</h2>\n<p>There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).</li>\n<li>Use a scalable resource type. <code>Deployments</code> and <code>DaemonSets</code> are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li>\n<li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol>\n<li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n<p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is\nimportant to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please\nconsult your cloud provider’s documentation.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nname: cloud-controller-manager\nnamespace: kube-system\nspec:\nreplicas: 2\nselector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nstrategy:\ntype: Recreate\ntemplate:\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nannotations:\nkubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure\nspec:\ncontainers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager\n- name: cloud-controller-manager\ncommand:\n- /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager\n- --leader-elect=true\n- -v=1\nimage: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest\nresources:\nrequests:\ncpu: 200m\nmemory: 50Mi\nhostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane\nnodeSelector:\nnode-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\"\naffinity:\npodAntiAffinity:\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n- topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\nlabelSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\ntolerations:\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\n</code></pre><p>When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that\ncluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple\nreplicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and\nredundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance\nof a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>As a Customer Success Manager (CSM), I often face complex challenges that require quick, efficient, and innovative solutions. Recently, one of my enterprise customers encountered an issue with Helm chart limits in the GitLab package registry. At GitLab, we are committed to dogfooding our DevSecOps platform, so I turned to <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/workflow/\">GitLab Duo Workflow</a>, our secure, agentic AI offering that is currently in private beta.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/agentic-ai/\">Agentic AI</a> represents the next evolution of generative AI, designed to go beyond single-task automation, such as code completion or test generation. While generative AI focuses on creating content based on specific prompts, agentic AI introduces a level of autonomy and context awareness, enabling it to perform complex, multi-step workflows. This advanced AI operates as a capable assistant that understands the broader goals of a task, plans intermediate steps, and executes them efficiently.</p>\n<p>Agentic AI, more specifically Duo Workflow, has transformed how I approach problem-solving as a CSM. Here's how I used Duo Workflow to resolve a real-world challenge and deliver value to my customer.</p>\n<h2>Addressing Helm chart limits in the GitLab package registry</h2>\n<p>The customer was dealing with a hardcoded limit for Helm charts in the GitLab package registry, which wasn’t flexible enough for their needs. They required a solution that allowed administrators to configure limits dynamically through the Admin UI. Addressing this issue was critical to maintaining their workflow efficiency and satisfaction.</p>\n<h3>How I leveraged GitLab Duo Workflow</h3>\n<p>To craft an effective solution, I leveraged Duo Workflow, a game-changer for brainstorming and strategizing with agentic AI.</p>\n<p>My prompt was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am working on the following issue [insert issue number] and would like to resolve it. We have developed the following strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Implement the feature as an application setting in the Admin UI, rather than using a configuration file approach.</li>\n<li>Utilize the existing package_registry jsonb column in the application settings table. Add a new key to this JSON structure to store the Helm chart limit.</li>\n<li>Create a new section in the Admin UI (/admin/application_settings/ci_cd#js-package-settings) for “specific limits for each format”. This will require some design work to determine how to best display the setting.</li>\n<li>Add a number field in this new section to allow administrators to set the Helm chart limit.</li>\n<li>Update the backend logic in the Helm package registry (app/finders/packages/helm/packages_finder.rb) to use this new application setting instead of the hardcoded limit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please organize your updates into Frontend and Backend changes. Additionally, could you check if there are any specific requirements when adding a new column to the application settings table?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This prompt laid out a clear plan, enabling Duo Workflow to provide structured recommendations and actionable insights. The strategy developed was straightforward yet impactful. The changes were structured into frontend and backend tasks, ensuring clear separation and collaboration.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Result of GitLab Duo Workflow prompt\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/1hA1avL1LIbKwOtFSKnP7A/4a67ac8d1dd760ffb8a7b511d7a3f730/image3.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Result of GitLab Duo Workflow prompt - 2\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4T3arBMYhH3KoTMERxSkD1/7ed884cb8dc29ca862d662ade24deb2d/image2.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>After implementing the solution together with Duo Workflow, I submitted a merge request, which was successfully merged and became available in GitLab 17.10!</p>\n<p>The result? A flexible, user-friendly way for administrators to configure Helm chart limits, significantly enhancing the customer’s experience and aligning with their operational goals.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab package registry page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5RtTU6D8ilXevmP1joXkmH/8cd269aa8adfcd767b3e2a3298b7c2e5/image1.png\" /></p>\n<p>The customer is thrilled to have this functionality available as it provides them with the flexibility and control they need to streamline their workflows. What’s even more exciting is that it only took me <strong>hours</strong> to complete the implementation, compared to the <strong>days</strong> I initially estimated, thanks to Duo Workflow. As someone without prior development experience in GitLab, this was a huge win!</p>\n<p>This experience taught me the immense potential of AI tools like <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>. By combining human expertise with AI-driven insights, we can address even the most complex challenges effectively. As a CSM, leveraging such tools streamlines problem-solving and strengthens trust and partnership with customers.</p>\n<h2>Delivering value</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Workflow empowered me to tackle a complex technical issue head-on and find a solution that exceeded customer expectations.

CI/CD job token - “Limit access from your project” setting removal</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>In GitLab 14.4, we introduced a setting to <strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#limit-your-projects-job-token-access\">limit access <em>from</em> your project's CI/CD job tokens (CI_JOB_TOKEN)</a></strong> for added security. This setting was called <strong>Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access</strong>. In GitLab 16.3, we renamed this setting <strong>Limit access <em>from</em> this project</strong> for clarity.</p>\n<p>In GitLab 15.9, we introduced an alternative setting called <strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist\">Authorized groups and projects</a></strong>. This setting controls job token access to your project by using an allowlist. This new setting is a significant improvement over the original. The first iteration was deprecated in GitLab 16.0 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 18.0.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Limit access <em>from</em> this project</strong> setting is disabled by default for all new projects.

      "summary": "<p>Maintaining multiple compliance frameworks in fast-moving DevSecOps pipelines is more difficult than ever. As standards evolve independently and become more complex, organizations are buried in overlapping requirements and manual processes – draining developer time and slowing audits.</p>\n<p>To solve this, GitLab is introducing Custom Compliance Frameworks and 50 out-of-the-box (OOTB) controls for a wide variety of compliance standards, including ISO 27001, the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/10/29/new-cis-gitlab-benchmark-scanner-boosts-security-and-compliance/\">CIS Benchmark</a>, and SOC 2.</p>\n<p>Custom Compliance Frameworks enable organizations to map multiple, overlapping controls from different standards and regulations into a single, unified framework. This flexibility brings much-needed efficiency, allowing businesses to tailor compliance programs in a way that makes sense for them. As these policies are embedded directly into GitLab’s CI/CD pipelines, compliance is enforced automatically – without disrupting development.</p>\n<p>Additionally, with the OOTB controls, teams can accelerate compliance adoption, eliminating the need for external tools or complex custom configurations. By embedding compliance directly into the software development lifecycle, GitLab provides real-time visibility, automated enforcement, and simplified audit readiness so teams can ship secure, <em>compliant</em> software, faster.</p>\n<p>Custom Compliance Frameworks and OOTB controls are available now in GitLab Ultimate.</p>\n<h2>Mounting compliance pressure</h2>\n<p>Organizations must navigate various compliance frameworks to ensure adherence to numerous regulations and provide assurance to their customers. While these frameworks often share common controls, they rarely align. The result is a reality compliance teams know all too well: manual tracking through spreadsheets that breeds chaos, particularly during audit reviews.</p>\n<p>Developers are pulled into the compliance fray because modern software development is central to satisfying many of these controls. Instead of building and shipping secure software, they find themselves supporting evidence collection and compliance reviews. A Forrester Total Economic Impact™ Study of GitLab Ultimate found that prior to GitLab developers spent up to <a href=\"https://tei.forrester.com/go/GitLab/GitLabUltimate/?lang=en-us#Appendixes\">80 hours annually on audit and compliance tasks</a>; time diverted from writing code and delivering business value.</p>\n<p>This fragmented approach isn’t just inefficient, it’s costly. Compliance-related costs have <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2024-01/research-brief367.pdf\">surged by 60% over the past five years</a>, according to the CATO Institute. Without a system that connects compliance enforcement to where software is built, compliance will remain a burdensome afterthought that drives a wedge between developers and security teams.</p>\n<h2>Why should you care about Custom Compliance Frameworks</h2>\n<p>Our customers have asked for greater flexibility when it comes to the tracking and enforcement of compliance within DevSecOps workflows. With this release, we’re happy to empower customers in the following ways:</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance that fits the business, not the other way around</strong></p>\n<p>Regulatory requirements overlap across multiple frameworks causing complexity in tracking and enforcement. Custom Compliance Frameworks allow organizations to create a unified framework that cleanly maps the requirements and controls of multiple standards, reducing manual effort and reliance on costly consultants.</p>\n<p><strong>Faster compliance from setup through to audits</strong></p>\n<p>Start monitoring compliance instantly with OOTB controls aligned with key compliance standards, such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and CIS Benchmarks. Automated compliance monitoring and evidence collection cuts audit prep from weeks to days, ensuring developers can remain focused on delivering secure software.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in compliance at the speed of development</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike traditional GRC tools that operate in isolation, GitLab enforces compliance directly in CI/CD pipelines where work happens. This deep integration means compliance validation occurs automatically as code moves through the pipeline, eliminating the traditional friction between development speed and security requirements.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of how a custom compliance framework can be created in GitLab:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"custom compliance frameworks - edit requirement screen\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/7BjiePufARD6X0ZZMXXFY8/8c220f5a55c266f22ee6e98c75d5ba70/image6.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"custom compliance frameworks - screen showing requirements\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/1xYF2GNGhymcuIvvbw92jU/7ccb6a4a5016fe2627d6e9c8c7cb97c6/image2.png\" /></p>\n<h2>What to know about the Custom Compliance Frameworks rollout</h2>\n<p>There are two critical aspects of this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As of GitLab 18.0, Custom Compliance Frameworks will be enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Starting in GitLab 18.0, we’ve enabled Custom Compliance Frameworks by default. We’ve also removed &quot;Standards&quot; from the Compliance Center to simplify the experience. Don’t worry — your existing compliance controls still apply. We’ve converted the GitLab Standard and SOC 2 standards into compliance framework labels and transformed their compliance checks into controls (our new term going forward).</li>\n<li>Only GitLab Ultimate customers can define requirements, map controls, and enforce compliance frameworks. Premium users can still use compliance labels, but they won’t have access to the full feature set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about Custom Compliance Frameworks, please watch this introduction video:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfJ0oHCIn-8?si=z_Rt_ikry4RhjEAC&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<h2>Shift compliance left with GitLab</h2>\n<p>Similar to security, shifting compliance left means addressing compliance requirements earlier in the software development lifecycle. Since software is central to an organization achieving compliance, embedding controls where software is created is crucial. With GitLab, security and compliance teams can define frameworks, map controls, and automate enforcement directly in CI/CD pipelines. Developers stay focused on shipping features, while compliance teams gain real-time visibility and automated evidence collection to be audit-ready. This unified approach bridges the gap between development and compliance, helping organizations achieve continuous compliance as part of their DevSecOps practice.</p>\n<p>As a result, organizations using GitLab can reduce developer time spent on audit and compliance tasks by 90% and accelerate external audits from several weeks to under one week, according to <a href=\"https://tei.forrester.com/go/GitLab/GitLabUltimate/?lang=en-us#AnalysisOfBenefits\">Forrester</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re an existing GitLab Ultimate customer and would like to learn more about how Custom Compliance Frameworks can help improve your compliance and security program, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_center/\">visit our Compliance Center documentation</a> where we cover implementation requirements, use cases, and more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> ”The Total Economic Impact™ Of GitLab Ultimate” is a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of GitLab, October 2024.

      "summary": "<p>The Git project has just turned 20 years old. A lot has happened during these years, and while the conceptual design of Git hasn't changed significantly since its inception, the way users interact with the tool has changed quite significantly. We at GitLab are proud to build on top of this critical piece of software and to be part of its history.</p>\n<p>Join us on a journey through Git's history to explore how it has evolved over the years.</p>\n<h2>The first commit</h2>\n<p>The first commit was made on April 7, 2005, by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel: <code>e83c5163316 (Initial revision of &quot;git&quot;, the information manager from hell, 2005-04-07)</code>.</p>\n<p>As we can see, this\ncommit does not contain a lot of files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git ls-tree e83c5163316\n100644 blob a6bba79ba1f46a1bbf7773449c3bd2bb9bf48e8b\tMakefile\n100644 blob 27577f76849c09d3405397244eb3d8ae1d11b0f3\tREADME\n100644 blob 98a32a9ad39883c6d05a000a68511d4b1ee2b3c7\tcache.h\n100644 blob 74a0a234dd346fff51c773aa57d82fc4b83a8557\tcat-file.c\n100644 blob 840307af0cfaab31555795ce7175d5e9c9f981a0\tcommit-tree.c\n100644 blob 25dc13fe101b219f74007f3194b787dd99e863da\tinit-db.c\n100644 blob c924a6e0fc4c36bad6f23cb87ee59518c771f936\tread-cache.c\n100644 blob 1b47742d8cbc0d98903777758b7b519980e7499e\tread-tree.c\n100644 blob b8522886a15db861508fb6d03d4d88d6de912a4b\tshow-diff.c\n100644 blob 5085a5cb53ee52e1886ff6d46c609bdb2fc6d6cd\tupdate-cache.c\n100644 blob 921f981353229db0c56103a52609d35aff16f41b\twrite-tree.c\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition to build infrastructure, the first commit provides seven top-level commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>init-db</code> to initialize a new Git repository</li>\n<li><code>update-cache</code> to add files to the index</li>\n<li><code>write-tree</code> to take what is in the index and create a new tree from it</li>\n<li><code>read-tree</code> to read a tree object</li>\n<li><code>commit-tree</code> to create a commit from a tree</li>\n<li><code>cat-file</code> to read a specific object into a temporary file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the <code>git</code> command itself did not yet exist at this point in time.\nInstead, these commands had to be executed directly.</p>\n<p>As example, let's create a\nnew repository:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ mkdir repo\n$ cd repo\n$ init-db\ndefaulting to private storage area\n$ ls -a\n.  ..  .dircache\n</code></pre>\n<p>That looks quite unfamiliar: There is no <code>.git</code> directory, but there is a\n<code>.dircache</code> directory. And where was the private storage area?</p>\n<p>The early design of Git distinguished between a &quot;shared&quot; and &quot;private&quot; object\nstorage area. This object storage area was where all of your Git objects went. For example, your\ncommits and blobs.</p>\n<p>By default, <code>init-db</code> created a private object storage area that was only used for\nthe managed directory that it was created in. A &quot;shared&quot; object storage area, on\nthe other hand, shared object content across multiple managed directories so\nthat the same object did not need to be stored twice.</p>\n<h3>Create a commit</h3>\n<p>So, now that we have a repository, how did we create a commit? Well, it isn't as\neasy as today's <code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit</code>. Instead, you had to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Update the index by calling <code>update-cache</code> for every file that you want to\nadd.</li>\n<li>Write a new tree by calling <code>write-tree</code>, which takes everything you have\nadded to the index.</li>\n<li>Set up environment variables to tell Git who you are.</li>\n<li>Write a commit object by calling <code>commit-tree</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s create a commit in the repository:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ echo content-1 &gt;file-a\n$ update-cache file-a\n$ echo content-2 &gt;file-b\n$ update-cache file-b\n$ write-tree\n3f143dfb48f2d84936626e2e5402e1f10c2050fb\n$ export COMMITTER_NAME=&quot;Patrick Steinhardt&quot;\n$ export COMMITER_EMAIL=ps@pks.im\n$ echo &quot;commit message&quot; | commit-tree 3f143dfb48f2d84936626e2e5402e1f10c2050fb\nCommitting initial tree 3f143dfb48f2d84936626e2e5402e1f10c2050fb\n5f8e928066c03cebe5fd0a0cc1b93d058155b969\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn't exactly ergonomic, but it works! Let's have a look at the generated\ncommit:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ cat-file 5f8e928066c03cebe5fd0a0cc1b93d058155b969\ntemp_git_file_rlTXtE: commit\n$ cat temp_git_file_rlTXtE\ntree 3f143dfb48f2d84936626e2e5402e1f10c2050fb\nauthor Patrick Steinhardt &lt;ps@pks.im&gt; Wed Mar 26 13:10:16 2025\ncommitter Patrick Steinhardt &lt;ps@pks.im&gt; Wed Mar 26 13:10:16 2025\n\ncommit message\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that <code>cat-file</code> didn't print the contents directly, but instead wrote\nit into a temporary file first. But the contents of the file looked exactly how a\nmodern commit would look.</p>\n<h3>Making changes</h3>\n<p>Now that we have files, how do we get their status? You might have guessed it:\nthis could be done with <code>show-diff</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ show-diff\nfile-a: ok\nfile-b: ok\n\n$ echo modified-content &gt;file-a\n$ show-diff\n--- -\t2025-03-26 13:14:53.457611094 +0100\n+++ file-a\t2025-03-26 13:14:52.230085756 +0100\n@@ -1 +1 @@\n-content-1\n+modified-content\nfile-a:  46d8be14cdec97aac6a769fdbce4db340e888bf8\nfile-b: ok\n</code></pre>\n<p>Amazingly, <code>show-diff</code> even knew to already generate diffs between the old and\nnew state of modified files! Funny enough though, Git achieved this by simply\nexecuting the diff(1) Unix tool.</p>\n<p>In summary, all of this was still rather bare-bones, but it performed all of the\nnecessary duties to track history. There were still many limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There was no easy way yet to switch between commits.</li>\n<li>There was no way to show logs.</li>\n<li>There were no branches, tags, or even references. Users were expected to manually\nkeep track of object IDs.</li>\n<li>There was no way to synchronize two repositories with one another. Instead,\nusers were expected to use rsync(1) to synchronize the <code>.dircache</code> directories.</li>\n<li>There was no way to perform merges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Git 0.99</h2>\n<p>The first test release of Git was Version 0.99. This release came only two months after\nthe initial commit, but already contained 1,076 commits. There had been almost 50\ndifferent developers involved. The most frequent committer at this point was\nLinus himself, but he was closely followed by Junio Hamano, the current maintainer.</p>\n<p>A lot of things had changed since the initial commit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git started to track different development branches by using references, which\nin most cases removes the need to manually track object IDs.</li>\n<li>There was a new remote protocol that allows two repositories to exchange\nobjects with one another.</li>\n<li>The <code>.dircache</code> directory was renamed to <code>.git</code>.</li>\n<li>It became possible to merge single files with one another.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important visible change, though, was the introduction of\nthe top-level <code>git</code> command and its subcommands. Interestingly, this release\nalso created the notion of &quot;plumbing&quot; and &quot;porcelain&quot; commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Plumbing&quot; tools are the low-level commands that access the underlying Git\nrepository.</li>\n<li>&quot;Porcelain&quot; tools are shell scripts that wrap the plumbing commands to provide\na nicer, high-level user interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This split still exists nowadays as documented in\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git#_high_level_commands_porcelain\"><code>git(1)</code></a>, but because\nmost porcelain tools have been rewritten from shell scripts to C, the line between these two\ncategories has started to blur significantly.</p>\n<h2>Linus hands over maintainership</h2>\n<p>Linus never started Git out of love for version control systems, but because there was a need to replace BitKeeper for Linux kernel development. As such, he never planned to keep maintaining Git forever. The intent was to maintain it until someone trustworthy stepped up.</p>\n<p>That someone was Junio Hamano. Junio got involved in Git about a week after Linus’s first commit and already had a couple of hundred commits in the history after the Git 0.99 release. So, on July 26, 2005, <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0507262004320.3227@g5.osdl.org/\">Linus made Junio the new maintainer of the Git project</a>. While Linus has continued to contribute to Git, his involvement with the project faded over time, which is only natural considering that he is quite busy as head of the Linux project.</p>\n<p>Junio is still leading the Git project today.</p>\n<h2>Git 1.0</h2>\n<p>The first major release of Git happened on December 21, 2005, by\nJunio. Interestingly enough, there had been 34 releases between Version 0.99\nand Version 1.0: 0.99.1 to 0.99.7, 0.99.7a to 0.99.7d, 0.99.8 to 0.99.8g, and\n0.99.9 up to 0.99.9n.</p>\n<p>One of the more important milestones since 0.99 was probably the addition of the <code>git-merge(1)</code>\ncommand that allows one to merge two trees with one another. This is in stark\ncontrast to before, where one had to basically script the merges file by file.</p>\n<h3>Remotes</h3>\n<p>Another significant change was the introduction of shorthand notation for\nremote repositories. While Git already knew how to talk to remote repositories,\nusers always had to specify the URL to fetch from every single time they wanted\nto fetch changes from it. This was quite unfriendly to the users, because, typically, they wanted to interact with the same remote over and over again.</p>\n<p>You may know about how remotes work now, but the mechanism that existed at<br />\nthis point in time was still significantly different. There was no <code>git-remote(1)</code><br />\ncommand that you could use to manage your remotes. Remotes weren't even stored<br />\nin your <code>.git/config</code> file. In fact, when remotes were first introduced in<br />\nVersion 0.99.2, Git didn't even <em>have</em> config files.</p>\n<p>Instead, you had to configure remotes by writing a file into the<br />\n<code>.git/branches</code> directory, which nowadays feels somewhat counterintuitive. But<br />\nthe mechanism still works today:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git init repo --\nInitialized empty Git repository in /tmp/repo/.git/\n$ cd repo\n$ mkdir .git/branches\n$ echo https://gitlab.com/git-scm/git.git &gt;.git/branches/origin\n$ git fetch origin refs/heads/master\n</code></pre>\n<p>But that isn't all! The directory was soon renamed in Git Version 0.99.5 to &quot;remotes&quot;, so there are a total of three different ways to configure remotes in a modern Git client.</p>\n<p>Most of you have probably never used either <code>.git/branches</code> nor <code>.git/remotes</code>,<br />\nand both of these mechanisms have been deprecated since 2005 and 2011,<br />\nrespectively. Furthermore, these directories will finally be removed in Git 3.0.</p>\n<h2>Git branding</h2>\n<p>In 2007, the first Git logo was created. It’s arguable if you can call it a logo, because it only consisted of three red minus signs above three green plus signs, reflecting what the output of <code>git diff</code> looks like:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"three red minus signs above three green plus signs, reflecting what the output of \" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/7osV14Ac9DSSLpIDu1fpTc/3bb22ea949094764e8ec0dc009620093/image3.png\" /></p>\n<p>A bit later, in 2008, the website <a href=\"https://git-scm.com\">git-scm.com</a> was launched:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"landing page for git-scm.com in 2006\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/42hvCFymDZpr371GkfHaZG/a25d6226d3bf92ef561e24c65bdd72f6/image4.png\" /></p>\n<p>In 2012, the Git website was <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAP2yMaJy=1c3b4F72h6jL_454+0ydEQNXYiC6E-ZeQQgE0PcVA@mail.gmail.com/\">revamped</a> by Scott Chacon and Jason Long. It looks pretty similar to how it looks today:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"git website revamped in 2012\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/6djaYD1fIUcnnB4EhhSP2r/7f66f9d599f0fe2ce8295676e4808076/image2.png\" /></p>\n<p>This site redesign sports the new red-orange logo designed by Jason Long; the same logo that's currently used:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"git logo\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4Ll0I7lJ9LIfAChLp6YyaK/92c79bea2ec8b80f3c4de37e33a067e8/image1.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Git 2.0</h2>\n<p>Git already started to look a lot like modern Git at the 1.0 release, so we\nare going to do a big historical jump to Git 2.0. This version was\nreleased around 10 years after Git 1.0 and was the first release that\nintentionally contained backwards-incompatible changes in central workflows.</p>\n<h3><code>git-push(1)</code> default behavior</h3>\n<p>The change that arguably caused most the confusion in this release was the\nupdated default behavior of <code>git-push(1)</code>.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of different actions that Git could take when you push\ninto a remote repository and don’t specify exactly what you want to push:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git could refuse to do anything, asking you to provide more information of\nwhat exactly you want to push.</li>\n<li>Git could push the currently checked out branch.</li>\n<li>Git could push the currently checked out branch, but only if it knows that it\nhas an equivalent on the remote side.</li>\n<li>Git could push all of your branches that have an equivalent on the remote side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The behavior of modern Git is the so-called &quot;simple&quot; strategy, which is the third\noption above. But before Git 2.0, the default behavior was the &quot;matching&quot;\nstrategy, which is the last option.</p>\n<p>The “matching” strategy was significantly more risky. You always had to make sure that you\nwere fine with pushing all of your local branches that have an equivalent on the\nremote side before pushing. Otherwise, you might have ended up\npushing changes unintentionally. As such, it was decided to change the strategy\nto &quot;simple&quot; to reduce the risk and help out Git beginners.</p>\n<h3><code>git-add(1)</code></h3>\n<p>Another big change was the default behavior of <code>git-add(1)</code> when it comes to<br />\ntracked files that have been deleted. Before Git 2.0, <code>git-add(1)</code> wouldn't<br />\nstage deleted files automatically, but you instead had to manually add each<br />\ndeleted file by using <code>git-rm(1)</code> to make them part of a commit. With Git 2.0, this behavior was changed so that <code>git-add(1)</code> also adds deleted files to the index.</p>\n<h2>Celebrating the Git community</h2>\n<p>I won’t bore you with the details around how Git works nowadays – you probably use it daily anyway, and, if you don’t, there are many tutorials out there that can help you get started. Instead, let’s celebrate the Git community, which has ensured that Git works as well as it does 20 years later.</p>\n<p>Over time, Git has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accumulated 56,721 commits as of the Git 2.49 release.</li>\n<li>Received contributions from more than 2,000 different individuals.</li>\n<li>Published 60 major releases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Git project also has a steady influx of new contributors by taking part in <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/\">Outreachy</a>. New contributors like these are what will ensure that the Git project will remain healthy in the long term.</p>\n<p>As such, let me extend a big thank you to all contributors. It is your contributions that have made Git possible.</p>\n<h2>Going forward</h2>\n<p>It should be an uncontroversial take to say that Git has essentially won the competition of version control systems. It has significant market share, and it isn't easy to find open source projects that are using a version control system other than Git. So it has clearly done a lot of things right.</p>\n<p>That being said, its development hasn't stood still, and there are still many challenges ahead of Git. On the one hand, we have technical challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>modernization of an aging code base</li>\n<li>scaling with the ever-growing size of monorepos</li>\n<li>handling large binary files better</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And on the other hand, there are problems of a more social type:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>improving the usability of Git</li>\n<li>fostering the Git community so that the project remains healthy in the long<br />\nterm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There always remains work to be done and we at GitLab are proud to be part<br />\nof these efforts to make sure that Git continues to be a great version control<br />\nsystem for the next 20 years.</p>\n<h2>Read more about Git</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/07/celebrating-gits-20th-anniversary-with-creator-linus-torvalds/\">Celebrating Git's 20th anniversary with creator Linus Torvalds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/03/14/whats-new-in-git-2-49-0/\">What's new in Git 2.49.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/10/whats-new-in-git-2-48-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.48.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/05/30/a-beginners-guide-to-the-git-reftable-format/\">A beginner's guide to the Git reftable format</a></li>\n</ul>",

Ensure that you’re in a feature branch (not the main or default branch) before you start. If you’re already working on a merge request, it will have its own associated feature branch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(This step is optional.) Navigate to the file that defines the Java class for which you’d like to have GitLab Duo Workflow create unit tests. Inspect it so that you can later confirm that the generated unit tests do cover its class members.

      "summary": "<p>Let's talk about what happens when your organization adopts the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to scale to enterprise levels. You've got multiple teams working on complex products, and you need a way to coordinate all that work. But here's a common headache: Your planning happens in one tool, while your actual development work lives somewhere else entirely.</p>\n<p>This divide creates real problems day-to-day. Developers jump between systems constantly. Product managers struggle to get an accurate picture of progress. And everyone wastes time manually copying information from one place to another. It's precisely the kind of disjointed experience that SAFe was designed to eliminate.</p>\n<p>While your development teams might already be using GitLab for source code management, CI/CD, and security, you may wonder whether GitLab can also support your planning needs within the SAFe framework. The good news is that GitLab's Agile project management capabilities offer strong support for SAFe, in this article, you'll learn how GitLab maps to SAFe concepts and ceremonies, all within the same DevSecOps platform your software developers already know and love.</p>\n<h2>What is SAFe?</h2>\n<p>SAFe, or the Scaled Agile Framework, is a way to bring Agile principles to large organizations without losing speed, alignment, or customer focus. It takes the iterative and flexible teamwork model of small teams and applies its principles across big organizations that have multiple teams, roadmaps, and stakeholders. This brings the organization into alignment, all planning and executing in the same direction. For product managers, SAFe helps connect strategy to execution so you’re not just shipping fast, you’re shipping the right things, backed by clear priorities and cross-team alignment.</p>\n<p>SAFe reduces silos, encourages collaboration, and helps teams rally around customer outcomes, not just tasks. When integrated in GitLab, the magic really happens: visibility, traceability, and delivery all live in one place.</p>\n<h2>SAFe terminology in GitLab</h2>\n<p>First, let's establish how SAFe concepts map to GitLab:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">SAFe</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">GitLab</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Epic</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Top-level Epic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Capability</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sub-epic (Level 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Feature</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sub-epic (Level 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">User Story</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Issue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Task</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Task</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Team</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Custom Field / Scoped Label</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Sprint</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Iteration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Program Increment (PI)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Milestone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Value Stream</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Top-level Group</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Agile Release Train (ART)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Top-level Group</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>With this mapping as your guide, you can set up GitLab to mirror your SAFe implementation. The group structure lets you organize around your value streams and ARTs, while the work item hierarchy (with up to seven levels of nested epics!) gives you all the depth you need for complex product portfolios. Whether you're working at the portfolio level (with top-level groups), program level (with subgroups), or team level (with projects), GitLab's organizational structure aligns perfectly with SAFe's hierarchy.</p>\n<h2>Supporting SAFe ceremonies in GitLab</h2>\n<p>Now for the fun part - how do you actually run your SAFe ceremonies in GitLab? Let's walk through each one.</p>\n<h3>PI planning</h3>\n<p>To facilitate the cross-team alignment and dependency management that makes PI planning successful, GitLab offers several capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/roadmap/\">Roadmap</a> view to visualize features across teams and time periods</li>\n<li>Assign features to the PI <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/milestones/\">milestone</a></li>\n<li>Document and visualize cross-team <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/issues/related_issues/#blocking-issues\">dependencies</a> as they're identified</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab gives you flexibility for PI planning through both the Epic boards (which can be configured to show team assignments) and the Roadmap view (which shows features over time like a Gantt chart). You can switch between these views during your planning session depending on whether you're focusing on the timeline or team organization.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Roadmap view and epic board\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/36C6eDLeIoRoZLCWJuYcQW/ed58a4a3c323f4cb6675e342f7298d3b/image3.gif\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Roadmap view with Gantt chart\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/6WhPdthteizqh23lNGTnJp/86a4348773fa37f2ab0ce7c99774bde2/image5.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Refinement</h3>\n<p>As a product manager, running effective refinement sessions means having clear visibility into your feature backlog. You can run your refinement session right inside GitLab.

But there are game-changing reasons why I genuinely believe GitLab is different:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>No more context switching</strong> - Your planning, coding, testing, and security all happen in one place.</li>\n<li><strong>Everything's connected</strong> - You can trace work from the big epic down to the code and deployment.</li>\n<li><strong>Everyone's on the same page</strong> - Developers, product folks, and security teams all work together in the same tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Total visibility</strong> - Stakeholders have one place to check for updates.</li>\n<li><strong>The full picture</strong> - You see planning and development metrics together, so you know what's really going on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your dev teams already love GitLab, why make them jump to another tool for planning or create some complex, cobbled-together integrations? Bringing your SAFe planning into GitLab creates a much smoother experience for everyone.</p>\n<h2>Implementation principles</h2>\n<p>I've worked with teams transitioning from traditional SAFe tools to GitLab, and here's what I've learned: Focus on <strong>what each ceremony is trying to accomplish</strong>, not on recreating exact replicas of your old tools.</p>\n<p>The teams that get the most out of GitLab are the ones who embrace its native capabilities instead of fighting against them. Yes, it takes some initial work to figure out how to map your SAFe concepts and set up your workflows. But once you do, you'll find your processes actually get simpler rather than more complex.</p>\n<p>The key is defining conventions that everyone follows. Which labels mean what? How will you track teams? What goes in an epic versus an issue? With a little upfront investment in these decisions, you'll end up with an intuitive system that eliminates all that cross-tool coordination overhead.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>Ready to give this a shot? Here's how to start implementing SAFe in GitLab:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set up your structure</strong> - Create groups and subgroups that <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/07/22/best-practices-to-set-up-organizational-hierarchies-that-scale/\">match your organization</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Define your work breakdown</strong> - Decide how you'll use <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/02/06/unlocking-agile-excellence-gitlab-epics-for-seamless-portfolio-management/\">epics</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/issues/managing_issues/\">issues</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/tasks/\">tasks</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Create your iterations</strong> - Set up your <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/iterations/#create-an-iteration-cadence\">sprint schedule</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Add your milestones</strong> - <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/milestones/#create-a-milestone\">Milestones</a> will represent your Program Increments in GitLab.</li>\n<li><strong>Build your boards</strong> - Create different views for different ceremonies.</li>\n<li><strong>Agree on conventions</strong> - Document how you'll use labels and custom fields.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Taking time to think through these decisions upfront will save you many headaches later. And remember, you don't have to perfect it on day one - you can always adjust as you learn.</p>\n<h2>Bringing it all together</h2>\n<p>GitLab gives you a solid foundation for running SAFe, especially if your dev teams are already GitLab fans. When you bring planning and development into the same tool, you eliminate those painful handoffs, make collaboration way easier, and get everything moving faster.</p>\n<p>The beauty of GitLab's planning tools is that they're flexible enough to adapt to your specific flavor of SAFe. You're not locked into rigid workflows - you can evolve your approach as your teams mature and your needs change.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ready to see how much better life is without those planning silos? <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">Start your free trial today</a> and experience firsthand how GitLab can transform your SAFe implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>💡 If you liked this topic check out this related post - <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-for-agile-software-development/\">GitLab for Agile Software Development</a></em></p>",

      "summary": "<p>The Git version control system was first released on April 7, 2005, by the father of the Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds. To mark the 20th anniversary of this important project that is nowadays used by almost every single developer, I interviewed Linus about the history of Git, why he handed over maintainership of Git, and what he considers to be its most important milestones.</p>\n<p><strong>In 2005, you were already the maintainer of the thriving Linux kernel. Why did you decide to start a new version control system?</strong></p>\n<p>So, I got into it from really despising version control.</p>\n<p>I had used the traditional version control systems (CVS/RCS/SCCS) both as an end user (i.e., tracking open source projects like <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/\">GCC</a>) and as a developer (we used CVS at Transmeta for everything) and absolutely hated the experience with a passion.</p>\n<p>&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/linustorvalds.png&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; style=&quot;padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px&quot;/&gt;</p>\n<p>And yes, back then most projects that used CVS had probably moved to <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\">SVN</a>, but honestly, I always felt that SVN was just &quot;lipstick on a pig.&quot; It was just CVS in another form, with some UI improvements, but none of the fundamentals fixed, and a few new problems added.</p>\n<p>The problems with CVS and its ilk are too many to even list, and, happily, they have largely become irrelevant and younger developers have probably never even had to deal with any of it. I absolutely refused to deal with it for the kernel, even though a few subsystems (notably the networking side) were actually using CVS to track their code back in the '90s.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back then I lived in the Bay Area, and Larry McVoy, who I knew from other projects (mainly <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sd96/full_papers/mcvoy.pdf\">lmbench</a>), had started BitMover, which had a new version control model called BitKeeper, or BK, for short.</p>\n<p>BK wasn't open source, but Larry liked open source projects and really felt that the lack of version control was holding the kernel back. He wasn't wrong, but the traditional source code managers (SCMs) really didn't work for me at all. Larry spent some time showing me and David Miller (networking maintainer and existing CVS user) what BitKeeper could do.</p>\n<p>BK wasn't perfect, and it was based on Source Code Control System (SCCS) like so many other traditional SCMs were, and thus had the same broken &quot;history per file&quot; model that everybody else had, and that causes huge and fundamental issues with file renaming and deletion.</p>\n<p>But BK also wasn't just that &quot;lipstick&quot; thing. It may have used SCCS at a low level, but on a higher level it fixed some really fundamental things, and did proper distributed development, and had a real global – not per-file – history that made merging code from different trees actually work.</p>\n<p>With CVS, creating branches and merging them was something you had to plan and discuss with people, and were major events. With BK, every repository was a branch. We take that for granted now, and Git obviously took it much further by having many branches <em>per</em> repository, but even the much more limited BK model was really a big deal at the time.</p>\n<p>Again, BK wasn't perfect. As mentioned, it did do per-file history, which really is a big fundamental problem that makes renaming and file merging simply not work reliably, and inevitably causes chaos and pain (for CVS people, think Attic, shudder). And it had some scalability issues, too, but those took a while to become more than a bit problematic.</p>\n<p>But the biggest problem with BK was the licensing, and while over the years (we used BK from 2002 to 2005) a lot of kernel maintainers did end up switching over to it, it was always a bit of a friction point. And that friction came to a head in late 2004, and the use of BK for the kernel basically became untenable a few months later.</p>\n<p>I was in the situation that for three years I'd finally used source control that worked, and it really had solved a lot of problems. There was no way I was going back to the days before source control, but in the years we'd been using BK, nothing better had really come out of the open source community.</p>\n<p>Sure, people knew that CVS and SVN didn't work well, and there were projects that tried alternate approaches, but some of those approaches were even worse (basically amounting to &quot;fancy patch tracking&quot;), or had some good ideas but in the process making up some entirely new horrible design mistakes (<a href=\"https://www.monotone.ca/\">Monotone</a>).</p>\n<p>So, I looked around for a while, and decided that I didn't have any options – I had to write my own.</p>\n<p>Now, technically, it actually did take only a few days to make the first version of Git, and hey, it's all there in the Git commit history. It's easy enough to see how it goes from pretty much zero to being usable enough that I started applying patches from others a week later (and being actively used for the kernel a few days after that).</p>\n<p>But that ignores the fact that I had been <em>thinking</em> about the problem for a while by then. Writing code is easy. Getting a good design is what matters. So there was a fair amount of background to those few days that is pretty important, and that part doesn't show up in the history.</p>\n<p>And hey, that first version was very, very rough, and didn't do a lot that was to come later. But you can definitely already see much of the core design in those first few days.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you give us a short recount of the first days and weeks of how the Git project was started?</strong></p>\n<p>I had basically decided that I will stop kernel development until I had an alternative that worked for me. The main goals were to be distributed and high performance, and be something you could absolutely rely on to catch any corruption.</p>\n<p>But I really do want to stress that I wasn't interested in SCMs, per se. I was interested in the end result, not in the process. So Git was never like the kernel for me: I do Linux because I think kernels are interesting - I did Git because I had to.</p>\n<p>Which then directly segues into your next question.</p>\n<p><strong>You handed over the maintainership of Git to Junio Hamano after a couple of months, and Junio is still the maintainer. Why did you hand over maintainership and what made you pick Junio?</strong></p>\n<p>Handing over maintainership was not a hard choice. It was very much: &quot;The moment somebody else comes along that I can trust to keep it going, I'll go back to doing just the kernel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Which is not to say that I just threw things over the wall and prayed for the best. I ended up maintaining Git for something like four months because I felt I needed to find somebody who would stick around, and had that hard-to-explain quality of &quot;GoodTaste&quot;(TM).</p>\n<p>Junio had been one of the very early people involved (he literally showed up the first week of development), but it's not like I just said, &quot;Tag, you're it.&quot;  It takes a while to see who sticks around, and who writes code and makes decisions that make sense.</p>\n<p>And I think Junio has been exemplary. I get much too much credit for the few months I spent on Git - particularly in light of the 20th anniversary. I'll take credit for getting the core design right, and getting the project started, but it really is Junio who has led the project (not to belittle the hundreds of other people involved, but still).</p>\n<p><strong>The initial version of the Mercurial version control system was released only 12 days after the initial version of Git, on April 19, 2005. Many people claim that Mercurial's user experience was superior over Git's, but nowadays Git is significantly more popular. Why do you think that Git has won over Mercurial?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, a big part of it is obviously just network effects, and SCMs have very strong network effects. It's why CVS survived as long as it did despite its limitations.</p>\n<p>So, the fact that the kernel used Git (and then at some point it got to be very popular in the Ruby on Rails community, and then it took off everywhere).</p>\n<p>But I really do think that the design of Git is superior. The core model is both very simple and very powerful, and I think that made it easier to translate into other environments. JGit was an early example of that, but you obviously have implementations like the MSgit virtual filesystem, etc.</p>\n<p>And while Git was famously somewhat hard to use early on, I really do think that some of that comes from having done things &quot;right,&quot; where people coming from other environments found Git non-intuitive because Git really did a few hard decisions that a traditional SCM person would never have done.</p>\n<p><strong>The Git project has not stood still since you handed maintainership over to Junio, and its community is always busy working on new features. What do you think the most important milestones were after you have left the project?</strong></p>\n<p>That's really hard for me to say, mainly because I obviously made Git work for me, and so the things <em>I</em> use have worked from pretty much Day One. Just as an obvious example: Making Git work on Windows was obviously a huge step for other people, but it affected <em>me</em> not at all ;)</p>\n<p>There's obviously all the infrastructure within Git itself to make it a lot easier to use, but I think most of the big milestones have all been around people taking the Git infrastructure and building things around it. Those often end up feeding back into Git features, of course, but, at the same time, the milestone is about something external.</p>\n<p>To give an obvious example: All the big Git hosting sites were big milestones. Making Git be distributed was what made those so much easier to do, but the <em>milestone</em> was how then the hosting made it so easy for users to use Git for various projects.</p>\n<p><strong>If you had the capacity to work on Git full time again, would there be anything that you would like to implement?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely not. Git did everything I really needed from very early on – my use is actually fairly limited, and I only really care about one project.</p>\n<p>And I say &quot;absolutely not&quot; because I refer you to that earlier answer: I was never really interested in SCMs at all to begin with. I think a large reason for why Git ended up being so different - mostly in good ways - from other SCMs was that I approached it more like I would a distributed journaling filesystem, not really a traditional SCM.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there any feature or design decision in Git that you have come to regret in retrospect?</strong></p>\n<p>Design decisions? No. I still think the high-level design is just very good, and you can discuss various Git concepts without ever getting into the nitty-gritty complexity of actual implementation.</p>\n<p>And I think that's important in a project. You need a certain high-level design principle to guide the conceptual direction of a project.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people take that too far, and think that the high-level design means that the implementation must then slavishly follow some core principle. And that's wrong, too – the <em>implementation</em> will have lots of nasty corner cases because reality is hard and people want odd things, but there needs to be some kind of top-level design that you can point to and reason about at a high level before you get your hands dirty with the nasty reality.</p>\n<p>And I think Git has a good balance of that. A very straightforward object store design (call them &quot;structured Merkle trees&quot; if you are a CS person, or you might just think of them as a &quot;content addressable storage&quot; if you are a filesystem person). That core design is there – but at the same time, it's realistically just a very tiny part of the actual code. Most of the <em>code</em> is about all the things you can do with the core design, but that basic clarity of design still gives the project some kind of high-level structure.</p>\n<p>It's the same kind of high-level structure that Unix itself had, whether you said &quot;everything is a file&quot; or you were talking about process handling. There are a few &quot;concepts&quot; that drive the design, but then 99% of the code is about the ugly harsh details of what you build on top of that to make it all useful in the real world.</p>\n<p>I have two mantras in technology: &quot;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; (Newton) and &quot;Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration&quot; (Edison).</p>\n<p>But talking about the 99% perspiration: While I am very happy with the big design, there are certainly various details that I would have done differently if I were to do Git today.</p>\n<p>But honestly, they aren't that important. What's much more important is all the <em>good</em> details that have been done over the last two decades.</p>\n<p><strong>The Linux kernel has started to use Rust as a programming language for some of its subsystems. Do you think it makes sense to start using such newer programming languages like this in Git?</strong></p>\n<p>I suspect that when it comes to Git, there's less reason to try to mix languages, which is always somewhat painful.</p>\n<p>In the kernel, the end result is one single kernel binary – even if much of it can be loaded dynamically as modules, it is still linked together into effectively one single binary.</p>\n<p>And that makes using multiple languages more complex. But, on the other hand, the kernel also has more reason to worry about memory safety and, thus, look at newer languages.</p>\n<p>In Git, if somebody wants to write parts of it in Rust or another language, I suspect it makes much more sense to just go for a separate implementation rather than try to mix languages in one binary.</p>\n<p>Much of the Git core ideas are simple enough that just having parallel implementations of the core likely isn't too painful, and then you can target particular problem spaces where a different language makes more sense.</p>\n<p>And we've seen that in Git already, of course: That's exactly what JGit is. The use of a different language was due to a different web-based environment where that language choice was much more natural.</p>\n<p>I know that there are already Rust implementations of some of the core Git functionality, and I think the situation is similar: I suspect they make more sense in specific situations than in some kind of overall &quot;let's convert things to Rust&quot; kind of way.</p>\n<p>So for anybody who is interested in implementing things in Rust, I'd suggest looking for target areas where the advantages of Rust are more obvious. I don't think C has actually been all that problematic in the standard Git source base.</p>\n<p><strong>New version control systems are popping up every couple of years. Do you think that Git will stay relevant in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>I already mentioned the network effects in SCMs, and I think that means that to replace Git you have to be not just slightly better, you have to be enormously better. Or so compatible that you effectively are just a new implementation of Git.</p>\n<p>And I do think the SCM situation has changed – Git doesn't have the kinds of huge gaping fundamental problems that SCMs had before Git. So being &quot;enormously better&quot; is fairly hard.</p>\n<p>So, yes, I would expect Git to stay relevant for the foreseeable future, with people working on improvements <em>around</em> Git rather than replacements.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/14/journey-through-gits-20-year-history/\">journey with us through Git's 20-year history</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Learn more about Git</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/03/14/whats-new-in-git-2-49-0/\">What's new in Git 2.49.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/10/whats-new-in-git-2-48-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.48.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/05/30/a-beginners-guide-to-the-git-reftable-format/\">A beginner's guide to the Git reftable format</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git project</a></li>\n</ul>",

These challenges are particularly pronounced for data-intensive workloads like video streaming, large-scale data analytics, and security operations.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to announce a major evolution of DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS), which consists of four features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes per cluster</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Managed Cilium for high-performance networking</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These updates help to empower businesses to run larger workloads within a single DOKS cluster, reducing the need for complex multi-cluster management and unlocking new levels of performance, reliability, and simplicity.</p>\n<p>NoBid, a Kubernetes customer who joined us at Deploy 2025, has seen significant improvements in scalability and security when deploying DOKS. “DigitalOcean Kubernetes provides NoBid with a powerful platform for our containerized workloads,&quot; said Shawn Petersen, CIO at NoBid. “Additionally, the ability to rapidly scale based on business demand, handle 1.3 PB/month in data egress, along with better security controls were all key differentiators for us to partner with DigitalOcean.&quot; If you want to learn more about NoBid’s use case, <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/customers/nobid\">check out their case study.</a> Also, you can learn more about their migration from AWS to DigitalOcean and their subsequent 30% cost-savings by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVjg4aBnLlw\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">watching the testimonial they gave at Deploy 2025.</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"an-overview-of-each-new-feature-and-what-it-means-for-your-business\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#an-overview-of-each-new-feature-and-what-it-means-for-your-business\">An overview of each new feature, and what it means for your business</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#an-overview-of-each-new-feature-and-what-it-means-for-your-business\"></a></h1>\n<p>This announcement consists of four features that are new and coming to DOKS. It is important to understand and differentiate each one thoroughly, which is what the text below will do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"increased-cluster-capacity\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#increased-cluster-capacity\">Increased cluster capacity</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#increased-cluster-capacity\"></a></h2>\n<p>The first feature increases cluster capacity. We’ve doubled the maximum worker node count per cluster from 500 to 1,000, enabling businesses to scale effortlessly while keeping infrastructure streamlined and cost-efficient. With this increased cluster capacity, you no longer need to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters just to scale your workloads. This simplifies operations, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures a more consistent application performance across environments. Now, developers can deploy larger, data-intensive applications on a single DOKS cluster, simplifying operations and enhancing scalability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optimized-networking-with-vpc-native-kubernetes\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimized-networking-with-vpc-native-kubernetes\">Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimized-networking-with-vpc-native-kubernetes\"></a></h2>\n<p>The second feature we’re bringing to you is VPC-native Kubernetes, which assigns IP addresses directly from your virtual private cloud (VPC) address pool. This feature enables native routing between cluster and VPC resources, seamlessly integrating DOKS clusters with your existing network architecture. This enhances network performance, simplifies inter-cluster communication, and removes the need for complex network configurations—allowing your workloads to operate more efficiently. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/digitalocean-doks-managed-kubernetes-networking\">You can read more about this feature in our earlier blog post.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"improved-performance-with-ebpf-powered-networking\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#improved-performance-with-ebpf-powered-networking\">Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#improved-performance-with-ebpf-powered-networking\"></a></h2>\n<p>The third feature now replaces kube-proxy with eBPF-based routing, significantly improving data plane processing, bandwidth efficiency, and network latency. Unlike traditional packet filtering methods, eBPF enables high-performance, in-kernel processing, which reduces context switching overhead and accelerates packet processing times. Overall, this feature is especially beneficial for high-volume applications, such as real-time analytics, transaction-heavy workloads, and microservices architectures that require low-latency communication between services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"managed-cilium-for-high-performance-networking\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#managed-cilium-for-high-performance-networking\">Managed Cilium for high-performance networking</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#managed-cilium-for-high-performance-networking\"></a></h2>\n<p>The fourth feature is bringing Managed Cilium to DOKS for high-performance networking. With fully-managed Cilium running on the control plane, developers enjoy enhanced security, reliability, and scalability. By reducing operational complexity, businesses can focus on innovation rather than managing networking infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of Cilium Hubble provides enhanced network observability, making troubleshooting and performance optimization easier than ever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-this-means-for-your-business\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-this-means-for-your-business\">What this means for your business</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-this-means-for-your-business\"></a></h2>\n<p>Overall, this next evolution of our Kubernetes service will significantly enhance your environment, benefiting developers and decision-makers alike.</p>\n<p><strong>For your environment:</strong> Experience greater scalability, improved performance, and simplified networking, allowing applications to run more efficiently with reduced operational overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>For your developers:</strong> Enjoy a seamless experience with better observability, enhanced security, and less complexity in managing networking infrastructure.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/10551\">#10551</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">@rumstead</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/#default-resourceexclusions-configurations\">Ignore differences on high churn controller managed resources</a> like those from Cert Manager, Kyverno, Cilium, and Kubernetes.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>. Since we <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/announcing-argo-cd-v3-small-but-mighty-df05c0b39ad6\">announced Argo CD 3.0</a> many <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/help-us-shape-the-future-of-argo-cd-3-0-ebc670413312\">have offered feedback, contributions, and ideas</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*49UiTK-B6pgcG9ZfTjqYew.png\" /><figcaption>More than 94 contributors for Argo CD 3.0</figcaption></figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a0b933f4e58f\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-cd-v3-0-release-candidate-a0b933f4e58f\">Argo CD v3.0 Release Candidate</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months. If you are interested in contributing a canary step plugin to the community, simply open an issue under argo-rollouts requesting an argoproj-labs repository to host your plugin.</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a></p><h3>Analysis Consecutive Success Limit</h3><p>This provides the <em>inverse</em> of what an analysis currently does. The main use case for this is to allow users to wait on a condition (in a step analysis especially) to hold, before proceeding to the next step.</p><p>Here is an example analysis:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: AnalysisTemplate<br />metadata:<br />  name: success-rate<br />spec:<br />  args:<br />  - name: service-name<br />  metrics:<br />  - name: success-rate<br />    interval: 1m<br />    successCondition: result[0] &lt;= 0.95<br />    consecutiveSuccessLimit: 3<br />    provider:<br />      prometheus:<br />        address: http://prometheus.example.com:9090<br />        query: |<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;,response_code!~&quot;5.*&quot;}[1m]<br />          )) /<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;}[1m]<br />          ))</pre><p>You can find more information in the documentation found <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/analysis/#consecutivesuccesslimit-and-failurelimit\">here</a> .</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/y-rabie\">Youssef Rabie</a></p><h3>Other Features</h3><ul><li>New Prometheus metric: build_info (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3591\">#3591</a>)</li><li>Enable pprof profiling support (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3769\">#3769</a>)</li><li>Allow specifying full annotations for Nginx canary (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3671\">#3671</a>)</li><li>Credentials to download plugin (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3905\">#3905</a>)</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><p>We had 36 labeled bug fixes in this release some of the area’s of focus for bugs have been around Rollouts getting stuck progressing and better verification of not causing any outage during a rollout. So, if you have experienced any of these issue test this release out and let us know how it behaves.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>This releases big feature was around step plugins, I can’t wait to see what this feature empowers end users to create.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

This also allows for leveraging better naming convention, for example when the name of the team is present both in the ArgoCD Project and the Application Namespaces.

This is your big opportunity to make your voice heard and help Argo CD to become even better.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*w9rgGKfx4xouoCzr\" /></figure><h3>Multi-source application advancements</h3><p>Creating Argo CD applications <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">from multiple sources</a> was one of the most requested Argo CD features for a long time. This feature allows you to group information from multiple places (for example a public Helm chart plus your local values file) to form a single Argo CD application. Initial support for defining multiple sources was already added in Argo CD version 2.6, and the support for CLI was added in 2.11. The UI still assumed the application to have a single source and certain CLI features like rollback were not yet supported for an application with multiple sources.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, rollback of a multiple source application is now possible via both Argo CD UI and CLI.</p><p>In addition to the rollback feature, a new Sources tab has been added to the Application Details page, enabling users to manage (view and edit) the sources of an application.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mj0F_f8U8TQMhzvN\" /></figure><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/keithchong\">Keith Chong</a> (Red Hat) and <a href=\"https://github.com/JorTurFer\">Jorge Turrado</a> for implementing these features.</p><h3>Project Scoped Repository Credential Improvements</h3><p>Currently, multiple repository credentials sharing the same URL is not allowed by the Argo CD API. If the credentials are added directly to the argocd namespace, argocd-server won’t return an error, but this still does not work since the first secret that matches a repository URL is the one that gets returned, and the order is also undefined.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, Argo CD will allow multiple app projects to have the ability to have separate repository credentials having the same URL.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">Blake Pettersson</a> (Akuity) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Add labels for Kubernetes events</h3><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, users will be able to expose application labels on k8s events generated by Argo CD. When the events are created for Applications that have specific label keys defined in `resource.includeEventLabelKeys`, the controller will attach the matching labels to the events. This connection will make it simpler to filter or process the events based on the applications using these labels.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/svghadi\">Siddhesh Ghadi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Consistent Sharding Algorithm</h3><p>Argo CD provides the capability to employ sharding for different Argo CD application controllers. This allows you to assign specific clusters to specific controllers to distribute the load across the different shards.</p><p>The existing sharding algorithms, including the legacy method and the round-robin algorithm, have shown limitations in maintaining optimal load distribution and minimizing unnecessary cluster-to-shard assignment changes.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, a new sharding algorithm named “consistent-hashing” is introduced which reduces Cluster-to-Shard Assignment Changes and optimizes resource utilization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/akram\">Akram Ben Aissi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p>Here are some other new changes that made it into the release</p><ul><li>Updates to git client for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17566\">resolving semantic versioning tags</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/thepabloaguilar\">Pablo Aguilar</a> from Stone Payments)</li><li>Application Set Git Generator now supports <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18545\">GPG signature verification</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/ishitasequeira\">Ishita Sequeira</a> from Red Hat)</li><li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18250\">ls-remote request fail</a> metric (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>)</li><li>Add new<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/pull/560\"> annotation argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Force=true</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/kkk777-7\">Kota Kimura</a> from CyberAgent, Inc.)</li><li>Add support for setting a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17728\">grpc message size as an environment variable</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pavel Kostohrys</a> from Codefresh)</li><li>Display the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18116\">list of dependent resources</a> in the delete popup (by <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a> from Intuit)</li><li>Remove support for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/13203\">old tracking label</a> <em>applications.argoproj.io/app-name</em> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">Soumya Ghosh Dastidar</a> from Akuity)</li><li>Add support for<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18484\"> fish shell completion</a> to Argo CD CLI (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Sn0rt\">Sn0rt</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18657\">Skip calling git fetch</a> if the commit to checkout exists locally (by <a href=\"https://github.com/shady-canva\">Shady Rafehi</a>)</li></ul><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.12.0-rc1\">release notes</a>, and <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.11-2.12/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

<code>CA_HEADER_</code> (similar to <code>XDS_HEADER_</code>) that can be added to CA requests for different purposes, such as routing to appropriate external <code>istiod</code>s.\nIstio sidecar proxy, router, and waypoint now support this feature.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55064\">Issue #55064</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> corner cases where <code>istio-cni</code> might block its own upgrade. Added fallback logging (in case agent is down) to a fixed-size node-local log file.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55215\">Issue #55215</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code>&rsquo;s <code>WaypointAccepted</code> status condition was not being updated to reflect the resolution of a <code>GatewayClass</code> target reference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>WaypointAccepted</code> status condition for <code>AuthorizationPolicies</code> that referenced a <code>GatewayClass</code> and did not reside in the root namespace was not being updated with the correct reason and message.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where proxy memory goes up with gRPC streaming services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing changes to <code>ExternalName</code> services to sometimes be skipped due to a cache eviction bug.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a regression where the SDS <code>ROOTCA</code> resource included only a single root certificate, even if the control plane\nwas configured with both an active root and a passive root certificate that was introduced in 1.25.1.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55793\">Issue #55793</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

<code>EnvoyFilter</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes\">Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where customizing the workload identity SDS socket name\nvia <code>WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_SOCKET_FILE</code> did not work due to the Envoy bootstrap not being updated.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51979\">Issue #51979</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istiod fails with an LDS error for proxies &lt;1.23 when <code>meshConfig.accessLogEncoding</code> is set to <code>JSON</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55116\">Issue #55116</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>gateway</code> injection template did not respect the <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-logs-container</code>\nand <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container</code> annotations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where validation webhook would reject an otherwise valid <code>connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409\">Issue #55409</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) to now be affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

resulted in stale RDS.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49638\">Issue #49638</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Ambient <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policies were overly strict.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53884\">Issue #53884</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> failure to patch managed gateway/waypoint deployments during upgrade to 1.24.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54145\">Issue #54145</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in where multiple <code>STRICT</code> port-level mTLS rules in an ambient mode <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policy would effectively result\nin a permissive policy due to incorrect evaluation logic (AND vs. OR).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54146\">Issue #54146</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the wording of the status message when L7 rules are present in an AuthorizationPolicy which is bound to ztunnel, to be clearer.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54334\">Issue #54334</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the request mirror filter incorrectly computed the percentage.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54357\">Issue #54357</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where using a tag in the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label on a gateway caused the gateway to be improperly programmed, and to lack status.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54458\">Issue #54458</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where out-of-order ztunnel disconnects could put <code>istio-cni</code> in a state where it believes it has no connections.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54544\">Issue #54544</a>),(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53843\">Issue #53843</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access log order caused instability during connection draining.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54672\">Issue #54672</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the gateway chart where <code>--set platform</code> worked but <code>--set global.platform</code> did not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient mode destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the <code>istio-iptables</code> command to fail when a non-built-in table is present in the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing configuration to be rejected when there is a partial overlap between IP addresses across multiple services.\nFor example, a Service with <code>[IP-A]</code> and one with <code>[IP-B, IP-A]</code>.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52847\">Issue #52847</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>.\nBefore, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the\n1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> validation webhook rejecting an otherwise valid configuration <code>connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409\">Issue #55409</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

id=\"dns-proxying-on-by-default-for-ambient-mode\">DNS proxying on by default for ambient mode</h3>\n<p>Istio will generally route traffic based on HTTP headers. In ambient mode, the ztunnel only sees traffic at Layer 4, and does not have access to HTTP headers. Therefore, DNS proxying is required to enable resolution of <code>ServiceEntry</code> addresses, especially in the case of <a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Troubleshooting-Istio-Ambient#scenario-ztunnel-is-not-sending-egress-traffic-to-waypoints\">sending egress traffic to waypoints</a>.</p>\n<p>To make this easier in the default case, DNS proxying is enabled by default in ambient mode installations of Istio 1.25.  An annotation has been added to allow workloads to opt out of DNS proxying. Check the <a href=\"/news/releases/1.25.x/announcing-1.25/upgrade-notes/#ambient-mode-dns-capture-on-by-default\">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"default-deny-policy-available-for-waypoints\">Default deny policy available for waypoints</h3>\n<p>In sidecar mode, authorization policy is attached to workloads via a selector. In ambient mode, policy targeted by selector is enforced by ztunnel only. Waypoint proxies use Gateway API-style binding using the <code>targetRef</code> field. This led to a potential configuration where a workload was default-denied the ability to talk to an endpoint, but could bypass that configuration by connecting to a waypoint that <em>was</em> allowed to talk to that endpoint, and thus reach it anyway.</p>\n<p>In this release, we have added the ability to target policy to a named <code>GatewayClass</code>, as well as a named <code>Gateway</code>. This allows you to set policy on the <code>istio-waypoint</code> class, which apply to all instances of a waypoint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zonal-routing-enhancements\">Zonal routing enhancements</h3>\n<p>Whether for reliability, performance, or cost reasons, controlling cross-zone and cross-region traffic is often an important &ldquo;day 2&rdquo; operation for users. With Istio 1.25, this just got even easier!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#traffic-distribution\">Kubernetes&rsquo;s traffic distribution</a> feature is now fully supported, offering a simplified interface to keep traffic local. The existing Istio <a href=\"/docs/tasks/traffic-management/locality-load-balancing/\">locality load balancing</a> settings remain available for more complex use cases.</p>\n<p>In ambient mode, ztunnel will now report the additional <code>source_zone</code>, <code>source_region</code>, <code>destination_zone</code>, and <code>destination_region</code> labels to all metrics, giving a clear view of cross-zonal traffic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-new-features\">Other new features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We have added the ability to provide a list of virtual interfaces whose inbound traffic will be unconditionally treated as outbound. This allows workloads using virtual networking (KubeVirt, VMs, docker-in-docker, etc) to function correctly with both sidecar and ambient mode traffic capture.</li>\n<li>The <code>istio-cni</code> DaemonSet can now be safely upgraded in-place in an active cluster, without requiring a node cordon to prevent pods spawned during the upgrade process from escaping ambient traffic capture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"/news/releases/1.25.x/announcing-1.25/change-notes/\">the full change notes</a> for everything else that is new.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-125\">Upgrading to 1.25</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.25.

      "summary": "<p>When upgrading from Istio 1.24.x to Istio 1.25.x, please consider the changes on this page.\nThese notes detail the changes which purposefully break backwards compatibility with Istio 1.24.x.\nThe notes also mention changes which preserve backwards compatibility while introducing new behavior.\nChanges are only included if the new behavior would be unexpected to a user of Istio 1.24.x.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ambient-mode-pod-upgrade-reconciliation\">Ambient mode pod upgrade reconciliation</h2>\n<p>When a new <code>istio-cni</code> <code>DaemonSet</code> pod starts up, it will inspect pods that were previously enrolled in the ambient mesh, and upgrade their in-pod iptables rules to the current state if there is a diff or delta. This is off by default as of 1.25.0, but will eventually be enabled by default. This feature can be enabled by <code>helm install cni --set ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code> (Helm) or <code>istioctl install --set values.cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code> (istioctl).</p>\n<h2 id=\"dns-traffic-tcp-and-udp-now-respects-traffic-exclusion-annotations\">DNS traffic (TCP and UDP) now respects traffic exclusion annotations</h2>\n<p>DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) now respects pod-level traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. This behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ambient-mode-dns-capture-on-by-default\">Ambient mode DNS capture on by default</h2>\n<p>DNS proxying is enabled by default for ambient mode workloads in this release. Note that only new pods will have DNS enabled: existing pods will not have their DNS traffic captured. To enable this feature for existing pods, they must either be manually restarted, or alternatively the iptables reconciliation feature can be enabled when upgrading <code>istio-cni</code> via <code>--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code>. This will reconcile existing pods automatically on upgrade.</p>\n<p>Individual pods may opt-out of global ambient mode DNS capture by applying the<code>ambient.istio.io/dns-capture=false</code> annotation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grafana-dashboard-changes\">Grafana dashboard changes</h2>\n<p>The dashboards shipped with Istio 1.25 require version 7.2 or later of Grafana.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opencensus-support-has-been-removed\">OpenCensus support has been removed</h2>\n<p>Because Envoy has <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.33/v1.33.0.html#incompatible-behavior-changes\">removed the OpenCensus tracing extension</a>, we have\nremoved OpenCensus support from Istio. If you are using OpenCensus, you should migrate to OpenTelemetry.  <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2023/sunsetting-opencensus/\">Learn more about the deprecation of OpenCensus</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ztunnel-helm-chart-changes\">ztunnel Helm chart changes</h2>\n<p>In previous releases, resources in the ztunnel Helm chart were always named <code>ztunnel</code>.\nIn this release, they are now named <code>.Resource.Name</code>.</p>\n<p>If you are installing the chart with a release name other than <code>ztunnel</code>, the resource names will change, triggering downtime.\nIn this scenario, it is recommended to set <code>--set resourceName=ztunnel</code> to override back to the previous default.</p>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-early-days\">The early days<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-early-days\" name=\"the-early-days\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yace-gains-momentum\">Yace Gains Momentum<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#yace-gains-momentum\" name=\"yace-gains-momentum\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\">Gratitude and Future Vision<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#gratitude-and-future-vision\" name=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"try-out-yace-on-your-own\">Try out YACE on your own<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#try-out-yace-on-your-own\" name=\"try-out-yace-on-your-own\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

Prometheus has come a long way in that time, \nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to \ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-new\">What's New<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-new\" name=\"whats-new\"></a>\n</h1>\n<div class=\"toc toc-right\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\">New UI\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\">OTLP Support\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\">Native Histograms\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes\n</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-ui\">New UI<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\" name=\"new-ui\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please \n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\" name=\"remote-write-2-0\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. \nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\" name=\"utf-8-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"otlp-support\">OTLP Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\" name=\"otlp-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features \nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\" name=\"otlp-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\" name=\"utf-8-normalization\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:%7E:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"native-histograms\">Native Histograms<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\" name=\"native-histograms\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\" name=\"breaking-changes\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"performance\">Performance<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#performance\" name=\"performance\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a> \nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-next\">What's Next<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-next\" name=\"whats-next\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and… \nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong>\n</li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"try-it-out\">Try It Out!<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#try-it-out\" name=\"try-it-out\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\" name=\"otlp-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"native-histograms\">Native Histograms<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\" name=\"native-histograms\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-breaking-changes\">Other Breaking Changes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#other-breaking-changes\" name=\"other-breaking-changes\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"looking-back-at-2023\">Looking back at 2023<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#looking-back-at-2023\" name=\"looking-back-at-2023\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-year-ahead\">The year ahead<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-year-ahead\" name=\"the-year-ahead\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\">OTLP Ingestion GA<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion-ga\" name=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\">Support UTF-8 metric and label names<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\" name=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\">Native support for resource attributes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-support-for-resource-attributes\" name=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\">OTLP export in the ecosystem<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\" name=\"otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"delta-temporality\">Delta temporality<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#delta-temporality\" name=\"delta-temporality\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"call-for-contributions\">Call for contributions!<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#call-for-contributions\" name=\"call-for-contributions\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-didnt-you-go-for-a-feature-flag-that-we-can-toggle\">Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#why-didnt-you-go-for-a-feature-flag-that-we-can-toggle\" name=\"why-didnt-you-go-for-a-feature-flag-that-we-can-toggle\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it.

Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-noticeable-features-in-the-prometheus-2-43-release\">What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#what-are-the-other-noticeable-features-in-the-prometheus-2-43-release\" name=\"what-are-the-other-noticeable-features-in-the-prometheus-2-43-release\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements.

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\">History of the Forwarding Use Case<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\" name=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (: </p>\n\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"remote-write\">Remote Write<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write\" name=\"remote-write\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"prometheus-agent-mode\">Prometheus Agent Mode<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#prometheus-agent-mode\" name=\"prometheus-agent-mode\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\">The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\" name=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\">Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\" name=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\">How to Use Agent Mode in Detail<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\" name=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">usage: prometheus [&lt;flags&gt;]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage.

Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#summary\" name=\"summary\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

      "summary": "<p>Updates net-attach-def client library to 1.7.5</p>\n<p>From the release notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This release contains a fix related to the determination of the default interface, e.g. setting the default parameter to true in the network-status annotation based on the presence of a gateway in the CNI ADD success result ips.gateway and makes the determination of the default based on the first interface that has an associated value of gateway (using the interface index in the ips element in the CNI ADD success result).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This provides flexibility especially in CRI-O which uses the first interface and IP addresses for the pod.IP in Kubernetes, therefore. Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
