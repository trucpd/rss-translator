      "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 08:30:00 -0700",
      "summary": "<p>It’s no secret that Kubernetes can be both powerful and frustrating at times. When I first started dabbling with container orchestration, I made more than my fair share of mistakes enough to compile a whole list of pitfalls. In this post, I want to walk through seven big gotchas I’ve encountered (or seen others run into) and share some tips on how to avoid them. Whether you’re just kicking the tires on Kubernetes or already managing production clusters, I hope these insights help you steer clear of a little extra stress.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-skipping-resource-requests-and-limits\">1. Skipping resource requests and limits</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Not specifying CPU and memory requirements in Pod specifications. This typically happens because Kubernetes does not require these fields, and workloads can often start and run without them—making the omission easy to overlook in early configurations or during rapid deployment cycles.</p>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>:\nIn Kubernetes, resource requests and limits are critical for efficient cluster management. Resource requests ensure that the scheduler reserves the appropriate amount of CPU and memory for each pod, guaranteeing that it has the necessary resources to operate. Resource limits cap the amount of CPU and memory a pod can use, preventing any single pod from consuming excessive resources and potentially starving other pods.\nWhen resource requests and limits are not set:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resource Starvation: Pods may get insufficient resources, leading to degraded performance or failures. This is because Kubernetes schedules pods based on these requests. Without them, the scheduler might place too many pods on a single node, leading to resource contention and performance bottlenecks.</li>\n<li>Resource Hoarding: Conversely, without limits, a pod might consume more than its fair share of resources, impacting the performance and stability of other pods on the same node. This can lead to issues such as other pods getting evicted or killed by the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer due to lack of available memory.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with modest <code>requests</code> (for example <code>100m</code> CPU, <code>128Mi</code> memory) and see how your app behaves.</li>\n<li>Monitor real-world usage and refine your values; the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/\">HorizontalPodAutoscaler</a> can help automate scaling based on metrics.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye on <code>kubectl top pods</code> or your logging/monitoring tool to confirm you’re not over- or under-provisioning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: Early on, I never thought about memory limits. Things seemed fine on my local cluster. Then, on a larger environment, Pods got <em>OOMKilled</em> left and right. Lesson learned.\nFor detailed instructions on configuring resource requests and limits for your containers, please refer to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/\">Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods</a>\n(part of the official Kubernetes documentation).</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-underestimating-liveness-and-readiness-probes\">2. Underestimating liveness and readiness probes</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Deploying containers without explicitly defining how Kubernetes should check their health or readiness. This tends to happen because Kubernetes will consider a container “running” as long as the process inside hasn’t exited. Without additional signals, Kubernetes assumes the workload is functioning—even if the application inside is unresponsive, initializing, or stuck.</p>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>:<br />\nLiveness, readiness, and startup probes are mechanisms Kubernetes uses to monitor container health and availability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Liveness probes</strong> determine if the application is still alive. If a liveness check fails, the container is restarted.</li>\n<li><strong>Readiness probes</strong> control whether a container is ready to serve traffic. Until the readiness probe passes, the container is removed from Service endpoints.</li>\n<li><strong>Startup probes</strong> help distinguish between long startup times and actual failures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-1\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a simple HTTP <code>livenessProbe</code> to check a health endpoint (for example <code>/healthz</code>) so Kubernetes can restart a hung container.</li>\n<li>Use a <code>readinessProbe</code> to ensure traffic doesn’t reach your app until it’s warmed up.</li>\n<li>Keep probes simple. Overly complex checks can create false alarms and unnecessary restarts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: I once forgot a readiness probe for a web service that took a while to load. Users hit it prematurely, got weird timeouts, and I spent hours scratching my head. A 3-line readiness probe would have saved the day.</p>\n<p>For comprehensive instructions on configuring liveness, readiness, and startup probes for containers, please refer to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes</a>\nin the official Kubernetes documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-we-ll-just-look-at-container-logs-famous-last-words\">3. “We’ll just look at container logs” (famous last words)</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Relying solely on container logs retrieved via <code>kubectl logs</code>. This often happens because the command is quick and convenient, and in many setups, logs appear accessible during development or early troubleshooting. However, <code>kubectl logs</code> only retrieves logs from currently running or recently terminated containers, and those logs are stored on the node’s local disk. As soon as the container is deleted, evicted, or the node is restarted, the log files may be rotated out or permanently lost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-2\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centralize logs</strong> using CNCF tools like <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#sidecar-container-with-a-logging-agent\">Fluentd</a> or <a href=\"https://fluentbit.io/\">Fluent Bit</a> to aggregate output from all Pods.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopt OpenTelemetry</strong> for a unified view of logs, metrics, and (if needed) traces. This lets you spot correlations between infrastructure events and app-level behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair logs with Prometheus metrics</strong> to track cluster-level data alongside application logs. If you need distributed tracing, consider CNCF projects like <a href=\"https://www.jaegertracing.io/\">Jaeger</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: The first time I lost Pod logs to a quick restart, I realized how flimsy “kubectl logs” can be on its own. Since then, I’ve set up a proper pipeline for every cluster to avoid missing vital clues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-treating-dev-and-prod-exactly-the-same\">4. Treating dev and prod exactly the same</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Deploying the same Kubernetes manifests with identical settings across development, staging, and production environments. This often occurs when teams aim for consistency and reuse, but overlook that environment-specific factors—such as traffic patterns, resource availability, scaling needs, or access control—can differ significantly. Without customization, configurations optimized for one environment may cause instability, poor performance, or security gaps in another.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-3\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use environment overlays or <a href=\"https://kustomize.io/\">kustomize</a> to maintain a shared base while customizing resource requests, replicas, or config for each environment.</li>\n<li>Extract environment-specific configuration into ConfigMaps and / or Secrets. You can use a specialized tool such as <a href=\"https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets\">Sealed Secrets</a> to manage confidential data.</li>\n<li>Plan for scale in production. Your dev cluster can probably get away with minimal CPU/memory, but prod might need significantly more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: One time, I scaled up <code>replicaCount</code> from 2 to 10 in a tiny dev environment just to “test.” I promptly ran out of resources and spent half a day cleaning up the aftermath. Oops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-leaving-old-stuff-floating-around\">5. Leaving old stuff floating around</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Leaving unused or outdated resources—such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, or PersistentVolumeClaims—running in the cluster. This often happens because Kubernetes does not automatically remove resources unless explicitly instructed, and there is no built-in mechanism to track ownership or expiration. Over time, these forgotten objects can accumulate, consuming cluster resources, increasing cloud costs, and creating operational confusion, especially when stale Services or LoadBalancers continue to route traffic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-4\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Label everything</strong> with a purpose or owner label. That way, you can easily query resources you no longer need.</li>\n<li><strong>Regularly audit</strong> your cluster: run <code>kubectl get all -n &lt;namespace&gt;</code> to see what’s actually running, and confirm it’s all legit.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopt Kubernetes’ Garbage Collection</strong>: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/\">K8s docs</a> show how to remove dependent objects automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage policy automation</strong>: Tools like <a href=\"https://kyverno.io/\">Kyverno</a> can automatically delete or block stale resources after a certain period, or enforce lifecycle policies so you don’t have to remember every single cleanup step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: After a hackathon, I forgot to tear down a “test-svc” pinned to an external load balancer. Three weeks later, I realized I’d been paying for that load balancer the entire time. Facepalm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-diving-too-deep-into-networking-too-soon\">6. Diving too deep into networking too soon</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Introducing advanced networking solutions—such as service meshes, custom CNI plugins, or multi-cluster communication—before fully understanding Kubernetes' native networking primitives. This commonly occurs when teams implement features like traffic routing, observability, or mTLS using external tools without first mastering how core Kubernetes networking works: including Pod-to-Pod communication, ClusterIP Services, DNS resolution, and basic ingress traffic handling. As a result, network-related issues become harder to troubleshoot, especially when overlays introduce additional abstractions and failure points.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-5\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Start small: a Deployment, a Service, and a basic ingress controller such as one based on NGINX (e.g., Ingress-NGINX).</li>\n<li>Make sure you understand how traffic flows within the cluster, how service discovery works, and how DNS is configured.</li>\n<li>Only move to a full-blown mesh or advanced CNI features when you actually need them, complex networking adds overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: I tried Istio on a small internal app once, then spent more time debugging Istio itself than the actual app. Eventually, I stepped back, removed Istio, and everything worked fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-going-too-light-on-security-and-rbac\">7. Going too light on security and RBAC</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Deploying workloads with insecure configurations, such as running containers as the root user, using the <code>latest</code> image tag, disabling security contexts, or assigning overly broad RBAC roles like <code>cluster-admin</code>. These practices persist because Kubernetes does not enforce strict security defaults out of the box, and the platform is designed to be flexible rather than opinionated. Without explicit security policies in place, clusters can remain exposed to risks like container escape, unauthorized privilege escalation, or accidental production changes due to unpinned images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-6\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/\">RBAC</a> to define roles and permissions within Kubernetes. While RBAC is the default and most widely supported authorization mechanism, Kubernetes also allows the use of alternative authorizers. For more advanced or external policy needs, consider solutions like <a href=\"https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/\">OPA Gatekeeper</a> (based on Rego), <a href=\"https://kyverno.io/\">Kyverno</a>, or custom webhooks using policy languages such as CEL or <a href=\"https://cedarpolicy.com/\">Cedar</a>.</li>\n<li>Pin images to specific versions (no more <code>:latest</code>!). This helps you know what’s actually deployed.</li>\n<li>Look into <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/\">Pod Security Admission</a> (or other solutions like Kyverno) to enforce non-root containers, read-only filesystems, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: I never had a huge security breach, but I’ve heard plenty of cautionary tales. If you don’t tighten things up, it’s only a matter of time before something goes wrong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes is amazing, but it’s not psychic, it won’t magically do the right thing if you don’t tell it what you need. By keeping these pitfalls in mind, you’ll avoid a lot of headaches and wasted time. Mistakes happen (trust me, I’ve made my share), but each one is a chance to learn more about how Kubernetes truly works under the hood.\nIf you’re curious to dive deeper, the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/\">official docs</a> and the <a href=\"http://slack.kubernetes.io/\">community Slack</a> are excellent next steps. And of course, feel free to share your own horror stories or success tips, because at the end of the day, we’re all in this cloud native adventure together.</p>\n<p><strong>Happy Shipping!</strong></p>",

But have you ever wondered how these policies are developed, implemented, and standardized across the Kubernetes ecosystem? To answer that, let's take a look back at the work of the Policy Working Group.</p>\n<p>The Policy Working Group was dedicated to a critical mission: providing an overall architecture that encompasses both current policy-related implementations and future policy proposals in Kubernetes. Their goal was both ambitious and essential: to develop a universal policy architecture that benefits developers and end-users alike.</p>\n<p>Through collaborative methods, this working group strove to bring clarity and consistency to the often complex world of Kubernetes policies. By focusing on both existing implementations and future proposals, they ensured that the policy landscape in Kubernetes remains coherent and accessible as the technology evolves.</p>\n<p>This blog post dives deeper into the work of the Policy Working Group, guided by insights from its former co-chairs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimBugwadia\">Jim Bugwadia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/poonam_lamba\">Poonam Lamba</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sudermanjr\">Andy Suderman</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Interviewed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arujjval\">Arujjwal Negi</a>.</em></p>\n<p>These co-chairs explained what the Policy Working Group was all about.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Hello, thank you for the time! Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jim Bugwadia</strong>: My name is Jim Bugwadia, and I am a co-founder and the CEO at Nirmata which provides solutions that automate security and compliance for cloud-native workloads. At Nirmata, we have been working with Kubernetes since it started in 2014. We initially built a Kubernetes policy engine in our commercial platform and later donated it to CNCF as the Kyverno project. I joined the CNCF Kubernetes Policy Working Group to help build and standardize various aspects of policy management for Kubernetes and later became a co-chair.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy Suderman</strong>: My name is Andy Suderman and I am the CTO of Fairwinds, a managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service provider. I began working with Kubernetes in 2016 building a web conferencing platform. I am an author and/or maintainer of several Kubernetes-related open-source projects such as Goldilocks, Pluto, and Polaris. Polaris is a JSON-schema-based policy engine, which started Fairwinds' journey into the policy space and my involvement in the Policy Working Group.</p>\n<p><strong>Poonam Lamba</strong>: My name is Poonam Lamba, and I currently work as a Product Manager for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) at Google. My journey with Kubernetes began back in 2017 when I was building an SRE platform for a large enterprise, using a private cloud built on Kubernetes. Intrigued by its potential to revolutionize the way we deployed and managed applications at the time, I dove headfirst into learning everything I could about it. Since then, I've had the opportunity to build the policy and compliance products for GKE. I lead and contribute to GKE CIS benchmarks. I am involved with the Gatekeeper project as well as I have contributed to Policy-WG for over 2 years and served as a co-chair for the group.</p>\n<p><em>Responses to the following questions represent an amalgamation of insights from the former co-chairs.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"about-working-groups\">About Working Groups</h2>\n<p><strong>One thing even I am not aware of is the difference between a working group and a SIG. Can you help us understand what a working group is and how it is different from a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike SIGs, working groups are temporary and focused on tackling specific, cross-cutting issues or projects that may involve multiple SIGs. Their lifespan is defined, and they disband once they've achieved their objective. Generally, working groups don't own code or have long-term responsibility for managing a particular area of the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<p>(To know more about SIGs, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md\">list of Special Interest Groups</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned that Working Groups involve multiple SIGS. What SIGS was the Policy WG closely involved with, and how did you coordinate with them?</strong></p>\n<p>The group collaborated closely with Kubernetes SIG Auth throughout our existence, and more recently, the group also worked with SIG Security since its formation. Our collaboration occurred in a few ways. We provided periodic updates during the SIG meetings to keep them informed of our progress and activities. Additionally, we utilize other community forums to maintain open lines of communication and ensured our work aligned with the broader Kubernetes ecosystem. This collaborative approach helped the group stay coordinated with related efforts across the Kubernetes community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"policy-wg\">Policy WG</h2>\n<p><strong>Why was the Policy Working Group created?</strong></p>\n<p>To enable a broad set of use cases, we recognize that Kubernetes is powered by a highly declarative, fine-grained, and extensible configuration management system. We've observed that a Kubernetes configuration manifest may have different portions that are important to various stakeholders. For example, some parts may be crucial for developers, while others might be of particular interest to security teams or address operational concerns. Given this complexity, we believe that policies governing the usage of these intricate configurations are essential for success with Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Our Policy Working Group was created specifically to research the standardization of policy definitions and related artifacts. We saw a need to bring consistency and clarity to how policies are defined and implemented across the Kubernetes ecosystem, given the diverse requirements and stakeholders involved in Kubernetes deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you give me an idea of the work you did in the group?</strong></p>\n<p>We worked on several Kubernetes policy-related projects. Our initiatives included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We worked on a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) for the Kubernetes Policy Reports API. This aims to standardize how policy reports are generated and consumed within the Kubernetes ecosystem.</li>\n<li>We conducted a CNCF survey to better understand policy usage in the Kubernetes space. This helped gauge the practices and needs across the community at the time.</li>\n<li>We wrote a paper that will guide users in achieving PCI-DSS compliance for containers. This is intended to help organizations meet important security standards in their Kubernetes environments.</li>\n<li>We also worked on a paper highlighting how shifting security down can benefit organizations. This focuses on the advantages of implementing security measures earlier in the development and deployment process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us what were the main objectives of the Policy Working Group and some of your key accomplishments?</strong></p>\n<p>The charter of the Policy WG was to help standardize policy management for Kubernetes and educate the community on best practices.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this we updated the Kubernetes documentation (<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy\">Policies | Kubernetes</a>), produced several whitepapers (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-docs/papers/policy/CNCF_Kubernetes_Policy_Management_WhitePaper_v1.pdf\">Kubernetes Policy Management</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-docs/papers/policy_grc/Kubernetes_Policy_WG_Paper_v1_101123.pdf\">Kubernetes GRC</a>), and created the Policy Reports API (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/wg-policy-prototypes/blob/master/policy-report/docs/api-docs.md\">API reference</a>) which standardizes reporting across various tools. Several popular tools such as Falco, Trivy, Kyverno, kube-bench, and others support the Policy Report API. A major milestone for the Policy WG was promoting the Policy Reports API to a SIG-level API or finding it a stable home.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicy</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/mutating-admission-policy/\">MutatingAdmissionPolicy</a> approached GA in Kubernetes, a key goal of the WG was to guide and educate the community on the tradeoffs and appropriate usage patterns for these built-in API objects and other CNCF policy management solutions like OPA/Gatekeeper and Kyverno.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\">Challenges</h2>\n<p><strong>What were some of the major challenges that the Policy Working Group worked on?</strong></p>\n<p>During our work in the Policy Working Group, we encountered several challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One of the main issues we faced was finding time to consistently contribute. Given that many of us have other professional commitments, it can be difficult to dedicate regular time to the working group's initiatives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another challenge we experienced was related to our consensus-driven model. While this approach ensures that all voices are heard, it can sometimes lead to slower decision-making processes. We valued thorough discussion and agreement, but this can occasionally delay progress on our projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've also encountered occasional differences of opinion among group members. These situations require careful navigation to ensure that we maintain a collaborative and productive environment while addressing diverse viewpoints.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, we've noticed that newcomers to the group may find it difficult to contribute effectively without consistent attendance at our meetings. The complex nature of our work often requires ongoing context, which can be challenging for those who aren't able to participate regularly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell me more about those challenges? How did you discover each one? What has the impact been? What were some strategies you used to address them?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no easy answers, but having more contributors and maintainers greatly helps! Overall the CNCF community is great to work with and is very welcoming to beginners. So, if folks out there are hesitating to get involved, I highly encourage them to attend a WG or SIG meeting and just listen in.</p>\n<p>It often takes a few meetings to fully understand the discussions, so don't feel discouraged if you don't grasp everything right away. We made a point to emphasize this and encouraged new members to review documentation as a starting point for getting involved.</p>\n<p>Additionally, differences of opinion were valued and encouraged within the Policy-WG. We adhered to the CNCF core values and resolve disagreements by maintaining respect for one another. We also strove to timebox our decisions and assign clear responsibilities to keep things moving forward.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This is where our discussion about the Policy Working Group ends. The working group, and especially the people who took part in this article, hope this gave you some insights into the group's aims and workings.

      "summary": "<p>We're excited to announce the alpha support for a <em>changed block tracking</em> mechanism. This enhances\nthe Kubernetes storage ecosystem by providing an efficient way for\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi\">CSI</a> storage drivers to identify changed\nblocks in PersistentVolume snapshots. With a driver that can use the feature, you could benefit\nfrom faster and more resource-efficient backup operations.</p>\n<p>If you're eager to try this feature, you can <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#getting-started\">skip to the Getting Started section</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-changed-block-tracking\">What is changed block tracking?</h2>\n<p>Changed block tracking enables storage systems to identify and track modifications at the block level\nbetween snapshots, eliminating the need to scan entire volumes during backup operations. The\nimprovement is a change to the Container Storage Interface (CSI), and also to the storage support\nin Kubernetes itself.\nWith the alpha feature enabled, your cluster can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify allocated blocks within a CSI volume snapshot</li>\n<li>Determine changed blocks between two snapshots of the same volume</li>\n<li>Streamline backup operations by focusing only on changed data blocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Kubernetes users managing large datasets, this API enables significantly more efficient\nbackup processes. Backup applications can now focus only on the blocks that have changed,\nrather than processing entire volumes.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note:</h4>As of now, the Changed Block Tracking API is supported only for block volumes and not for\nfile volumes. CSI drivers that manage file-based storage systems will not be able to\nimplement this capability.</div>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-changed-block-tracking-support-in-kubernetes\">Benefits of changed block tracking support in Kubernetes</h2>\n<p>As Kubernetes adoption grows for stateful workloads managing critical data, the need for efficient\nbackup solutions becomes increasingly important. Traditional full backup approaches face challenges with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Long backup windows</em>: Full volume backups can take hours for large datasets, making it difficult\nto complete within maintenance windows.</li>\n<li><em>High resource utilization</em>: Backup operations consume substantial network bandwidth and I/O\nresources, especially for large data volumes and data-intensive applications.</li>\n<li><em>Increased storage costs</em>: Repetitive full backups store redundant data, causing storage\nrequirements to grow linearly even when only a small percentage of data actually changes between\nbackups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Changed Block Tracking API addresses these challenges by providing native Kubernetes support for\nincremental backup capabilities through the CSI interface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-components\">Key components</h2>\n<p>The implementation consists of three primary components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>CSI SnapshotMetadata Service API</em>: An API, offered by gRPC, that provides volume\nsnapshot and changed block data.</li>\n<li><em>SnapshotMetadataService API</em>: A Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that\nadvertises CSI driver metadata service availability and connection details to\ncluster clients.</li>\n<li><em>External Snapshot Metadata Sidecar</em>: An intermediary component that connects CSI\ndrivers to backup applications via a standardized gRPC interface.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"implementation-requirements\">Implementation requirements</h2>\n<h3 id=\"storage-provider-responsibilities\">Storage provider responsibilities</h3>\n<p>If you're an author of a storage integration with Kubernetes and want to support the changed block tracking feature, you must implement specific requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Implement CSI RPCs</em>: Storage providers need to implement the <code>SnapshotMetadata</code> service as defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/csi.proto\">CSI specifications protobuf</a>. This service requires server-side streaming implementations for the following RPCs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GetMetadataAllocated</code>: For identifying allocated blocks in a snapshot</li>\n<li><code>GetMetadataDelta</code>: For determining changed blocks between two snapshots</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Storage backend capabilities</em>: Ensure the storage backend has the capability to track and report block-level changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Deploy external components</em>: Integrate with the <code>external-snapshot-metadata</code> sidecar to expose the snapshot metadata service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Register custom resource</em>: Register the <code>SnapshotMetadataService</code> resource using a CustomResourceDefinition and create a <code>SnapshotMetadataService</code> custom resource that advertises the availability of the metadata service and provides connection details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Support error handling</em>: Implement proper error handling for these RPCs according to the CSI specification requirements.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"backup-solution-responsibilities\">Backup solution responsibilities</h3>\n<p>A backup solution looking to leverage this feature must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Set up authentication</em>: The backup application must provide a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token when using the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3314-csi-changed-block-tracking#the-kubernetes-snapshotmetadata-service-api\">Kubernetes SnapshotMetadataService API</a>.\nAppropriate access grants, such as RBAC RoleBindings, must be established to authorize the backup application\nServiceAccount to obtain such tokens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Implement streaming client-side code</em>: Develop clients that implement the streaming gRPC APIs defined in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshot-metadata/blob/main/proto/schema.proto\">schema.proto</a> file.\nSpecifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement streaming client code for <code>GetMetadataAllocated</code> and <code>GetMetadataDelta</code> methods</li>\n<li>Handle server-side streaming responses efficiently as the metadata comes in chunks</li>\n<li>Process the <code>SnapshotMetadataResponse</code> message format with proper error handling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>external-snapshot-metadata</code> GitHub repository provides a convenient\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshot-metadata/tree/master/pkg/iterator\">iterator</a>\nsupport package to simplify client implementation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Handle large dataset streaming</em>: Design clients to efficiently handle large streams of block metadata that\ncould be returned for volumes with significant changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Optimize backup processes</em>: Modify backup workflows to use the changed block metadata to identify and only\ntransfer changed blocks to make backups more efficient, reducing both backup duration and resource consumption.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>To use changed block tracking in your cluster:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure your CSI driver supports volume snapshots and implements the snapshot metadata capabilities with the required <code>external-snapshot-metadata</code> sidecar</li>\n<li>Make sure the SnapshotMetadataService custom resource is registered using CRD</li>\n<li>Verify the presence of a SnapshotMetadataService custom resource for your CSI driver</li>\n<li>Create clients that can access the API using appropriate authentication (via Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The API provides two main functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GetMetadataAllocated</code>: Lists blocks allocated in a single snapshot</li>\n<li><code>GetMetadataDelta</code>: Lists blocks changed between two snapshots</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes developers hope to push the CSI Snapshot Metadata implementation to Beta in the future releases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more\">Where can I learn more?</h2>\n<p>For those interested

      "summary": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes community, I am thrilled to announce that the Pod Level Resources feature has graduated to Beta in the Kubernetes v1.34 release and is enabled by default! This significant milestone introduces a new layer of flexibility for defining and managing resource allocation for your Pods. This flexibility stems from the ability to specify CPU and memory resources for the Pod as a whole. Pod level resources can be combined with the container-level specifications to express the exact resource requirements and limits your application needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pod-level-specification-for-resources\">Pod-level specification for resources</h2>\n<p>Until recently, resource specifications that applied to Pods were primarily defined\nat the individual container level. While effective, this approach sometimes required\nduplicating or meticulously calculating resource needs across multiple containers\nwithin a single Pod. As a beta feature, Kubernetes allows you to specify the CPU,\nmemory and hugepages resources at the Pod-level. This means you can now define\nresource requests and limits for an entire Pod, enabling easier resource sharing\nwithout requiring granular, per-container management of these resources where\nit's not needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-pod-level-specification-matter\">Why does Pod-level specification matter?</h2>\n<p>This feature enhances resource management in Kubernetes by offering <em>flexible resource management</em> at both the Pod and container levels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It provides a consolidated approach to resource declaration, reducing the need for\nmeticulous, per-container management, especially for Pods with multiple\ncontainers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources enable containers within a pod to share unused resoures\namongst themselves, promoting efficient utilization within the pod. For example,\nit prevents sidecar containers from becoming performance bottlenecks. Previously,\na sidecar (e.g., a logging agent or service mesh proxy) hitting its individual CPU\nlimit could be throttled and slow down the entire Pod, even if the main\napplication container had plenty of spare CPU. With pod-level resources, the\nsidecar and the main container can share Pod's resource budget, ensuring smooth\noperation during traffic spikes - either the whole Pod is throttled or all\ncontainers work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When both pod-level and container-level resources are specified, pod-level\nrequests and limits take precedence. This gives you – and cluster administrators -\na powerful way to enforce overall resource boundaries for your Pods.</p>\n<p>For scheduling, if a pod-level request is explicitly defined, the scheduler uses\nthat specific value to find a suitable node, insteaf of the aggregated requests of\nthe individual containers. At runtime, the pod-level limit acts as a hard ceiling\nfor the combined resource usage of all containers. Crucially, this pod-level limit\nis the absolute enforcer; even if the sum of the individual container limits is\nhigher, the total resource consumption can never exceed the pod-level limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources are <strong>prioritized</strong> in influencing the Quality of Service (QoS) class of the Pod.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For Pods running on Linux nodes, the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustment\ncalculation considers both pod-level and container-level resources requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources are <strong>designed to be compatible with existing Kubernetes functionalities</strong>, ensuring a smooth integration into your workflows.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-specify-resources-for-an-entire-pod\">How to specify resources for an entire Pod</h2>\n<p>Using <code>PodLevelResources</code> <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature\ngate</a> requires\nKubernetes v1.34 or newer for all cluster components, including the control plane\nand every node.

The v1.34 implementation of Pod level resources\nfocuses on allowing initial declaration of an overall resource envelope, that\napplies to the <strong>entire Pod</strong>. That is distinct from in-place pod resize, which\n(despite what the name might suggest) allows you\nto make dynamic adjustments to <em>container</em> resource\nrequests and limits, within a <em>running</em> Pod,\nand potentially without a container restart.

Any quota consumed by failed expansion will be returned to the user and the associated PersistentVolume should be resized to the\nlatest size you specified.</p>\n<p>I'll walk through an example of how all of this works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reducing-pvc-size-to-recover-from-failed-expansion\">Reducing PVC size to recover from failed expansion</h2>\n<p>Imagine that you are running out of disk space for one of your database servers, and you want to expand the PVC from previously\nspecified <code>10TB</code> to <code>100TB</code> - but you make a typo and specify <code>1000TB</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>PersistentVolumeClaim<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>myclaim<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">accessModes</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- ReadWriteOnce<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">requests</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">storage</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>1000TB<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># newly specified size - but incorrect!</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, you may be out of disk space on your disk array or simply ran out of allocated quota on your cloud-provider.

      "summary": "<p>Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) is a Kubernetes API for managing scarce resources across Pods and containers.\nIt enables flexible resource requests, going beyond simply allocating <em>N</em> number of devices to support more granular usage scenarios.\nWith DRA, users can request specific types of devices based on their attributes, define custom configurations tailored to their workloads, and even share the same resource among multiple containers or Pods.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we focus on the device sharing feature and dive into a new capability introduced in Kubernetes 1.34: <em>DRA consumable capacity</em>,\nwhich extends DRA to support finer-grained device sharing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background-device-sharing-via-resourceclaims\">Background: device sharing via ResourceClaims</h2>\n<p>From the beginning, DRA introduced the ability for multiple Pods to share a device by referencing the same ResourceClaim.\nThis design decouples resource allocation from specific hardware, allowing for more dynamic and reusable provisioning of devices.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes 1.33, the new support for <em>partitionable devices</em> allowed resource drivers to advertise slices of a device that are available, rather than exposing the entire device as an all-or-nothing resource.\nThis enabled Kubernetes to model shareable hardware more accurately.</p>\n<p>But there was still a missing piece: it didn't yet support scenarios\nwhere the device driver manages fine-grained, dynamic portions of a device resource — like network bandwidth — based on user demand,\nor to share those resources independently of ResourceClaims, which are restricted by their spec and namespace.</p>\n<p>That’s where <em>consumable capacity</em> for DRA comes in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-dra-consumable-capacity-support\">Benefits of DRA consumable capacity support</h2>\n<p>Here's a taste of what you get in a cluster with the <code>DRAConsumableCapacity</code>\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> enabled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"device-sharing-across-multiple-resourceclaims-or-devicerequests\">Device sharing across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests</h3>\n<p>Resource drivers can now support sharing the same device — or even a slice of a device — across multiple ResourceClaims or across multiple DeviceRequests.</p>\n<p>This means that Pods from different namespaces can simultaneously share the same device,\nif permitted and supported by the specific DRA driver.</p>\n<h3 id=\"device-resource-allocation\">Device resource allocation</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes extends the allocation algorithm in the scheduler to support allocating a portion of a device's resources, as defined in the <code>capacity</code> field.\nThe scheduler ensures that the total allocated capacity across all consumers never exceeds the device’s total capacity, even when shared across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests.\nThis is very similar to the way the scheduler allows Pods and containers to share allocatable resources on Nodes;\nin this case, it allows them to share allocatable (consumable) resources on Devices.</p>\n<p>This feature expands support for scenarios where the device driver is able to manage resources <strong>within</strong> a device and on a per-process basis — for example,\nallocating a specific amount of memory (e.g., 8 GiB) from a virtual GPU,\nor setting bandwidth limits on virtual network interfaces allocated to specific Pods. This aims to provide safe and efficient resource sharing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"distinctattribute-constraint\">DistinctAttribute constraint</h3>\n<p>This feature also introduces a new constraint: <code>DistinctAttribute</code>, which is the complement of the existing <code>MatchAttribute</code> constraint.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of <code>DistinctAttribute</code> is to prevent the same underlying device from being allocated multiple times within a single ResourceClaim, which could happen since we are allocating shares (or subsets) of devices.\nThis constraint ensures that each allocation refers to a distinct resource, even if they belong to the same device class.</p>\n<p>It is useful for use cases such as allocating network devices connecting to different subnets to expand coverage or provide redundancy across failure domains.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-consumable-capacity\">How to use consumable capacity?</h2>\n<p><code>DRAConsumableCapacity</code> is introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.34.

      "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>The rise of AI/ML and other high-performance workloads has made specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs a critical component of many Kubernetes clusters. However, as discussed in a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/\">previous blog post about navigating failures in Pods with devices</a>, when this hardware fails, it can be difficult to diagnose, leading to significant downtime. With the release of Kubernetes v1.34, we are excited to announce a new alpha feature that brings much-needed visibility into the health of these devices.</p>\n<p>This work extends the functionality of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4680-add-resource-health-to-pod-status\">KEP-4680</a>, which first introduced a mechanism for reporting the health of devices managed by Device Plugins. Now, this capability is being extended to <em>Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)</em>. Controlled by the <code>ResourceHealthStatus</code> feature gate, this enhancement allows DRA drivers to report device health directly into a Pod's <code>.status</code> field, providing crucial insights for operators and developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-expose-device-health-in-pod-status\">Why expose device health in Pod status?</h2>\n<p>For stateful applications or long-running jobs, a device failure can be disruptive and costly. By exposing device health in the <code>.status</code> field for a Pod, Kubernetes provides a standardized way for users and automation tools to quickly diagnose issues. If a Pod is failing, you can now check its status to see if an unhealthy device is the root cause, saving valuable time that might otherwise be spent debugging application code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>This feature introduces a new, optional communication channel between the Kubelet and DRA drivers, built on three core components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-new-grpc-health-service\">A new gRPC health service</h3>\n<p>A new gRPC service, <code>DRAResourceHealth</code>, is defined in the <code>dra-health/v1alpha1</code> API group. DRA drivers can implement this service to stream device health updates to the Kubelet. The service includes a <code>NodeWatchResources</code> server-streaming RPC that sends the health status (<code>Healthy</code>, <code>Unhealthy</code>, or <code>Unknown</code>) for the devices it manages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kubelet-integration\">Kubelet integration</h3>\n<p>The Kubelet’s <code>DRAPluginManager</code> discovers which drivers implement the health service. For each compatible driver, it starts a long-lived <code>NodeWatchResources</code> stream to receive health updates. The DRA Manager then consumes these updates and stores them in a persistent <code>healthInfoCache</code> that can survive Kubelet restarts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"populating-the-pod-status\">Populating the Pod status</h3>\n<p>When a device's health changes, the DRA manager identifies all Pods affected by the change and triggers a Pod status update. A new field, <code>allocatedResourcesStatus</code>, is now part of the <code>v1.ContainerStatus</code> API object. The Kubelet populates this field with the current health of each device allocated to the container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-practical-example\">A practical example</h2>\n<p>If a Pod is in a <code>CrashLoopBackOff</code> state, you can use <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;</code> to inspect its status. If an allocated device has failed, the output will now include the <code>allocatedResourcesStatus</code> field, clearly indicating the problem:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">status</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">containerStatuses</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>my-gpu-intensive-container<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># ... other container statuses</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">allocatedResourcesStatus</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"claim:my-gpu-claim\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resourceID</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"example.com/gpu-a1b2-c3d4\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">health</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"Unhealthy\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This explicit status makes it clear that the issue is with the underlying hardware, not the application.</p>\n<p>Now you can improve the failure detection logic to react on the unhealthy devices associated with the Pod by de-scheduling a Pod.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-this-feature\">How to use this feature</h2>\n<p>As this is an alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.34, you must take the following steps to use it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable the <code>ResourceHealthStatus</code> feature gate on your kube-apiserver and kubelets.</li>\n<li>Ensure you are using a DRA driver that implements the <code>v1alpha1 DRAResourceHealth</code> gRPC service.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"dra-drivers\">DRA drivers</h2>\n<p>If you are developing a DRA driver, make sure to think about device failure detection strategy and ensure that your driver is integrated with this feature. This way, your driver will improve the user experience and simplify debuggability of hardware issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>This is the first step in a broader effort to improve how Kubernetes handles device failures. As we gather feedback on this alpha feature, the community is planning several key enhancements before graduating to Beta:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Detailed health messages:</em> To improve the troubleshooting experience, we plan to add a human-readable message field to the gRPC API. This will allow DRA drivers to provide specific context for a health status, such as &quot;GPU temperature exceeds threshold&quot; or &quot;NVLink connection lost&quot;.</li>\n<li><em>Configurable health timeouts:</em> The timeout for marking a device's health as &quot;Unknown&quot; is currently hardcoded. We plan to make this configurable, likely on a per-driver basis, to better accommodate the different health-reporting characteristics of various hardware.</li>\n<li><em>Improved post-mortem troubleshooting:</em> We will address a known limitation where health updates may not be applied to pods that have already terminated. This fix will ensure that the health status of a device at the time of failure is preserved, which is crucial for troubleshooting batch jobs and other &quot;run-to-completion&quot; workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature was developed as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4680-add-resource-health-to-pod-status\">KEP-4680</a>, and community feedback is crucial as we work toward graduating it to Beta. We have more improvements of device failure handling in k8s and encourage you to try it out and share your experiences with the SIG Node community!</p>",

It's frequently used for configuration files and data transfer. YAML is well-suited for organizing hierarchical information and is often used as an alternative to JSON and XML.</p>\n<h2>What is YAML used for?</h2>\n<p>Thanks to its easy readability, YAML is used for writing configuration files and playbooks. Here are some examples for reference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Configuration file descriptions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Log files</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inter-process messaging</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data sharing between applications</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Structured data descriptions</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>YAML vs. YML: What's the difference?</h2>\n<p>Both refer to the same file format — the only difference is whether the extension is .yml or .yaml. While .yaml is the official extension indicating a YAML file, extensions are generally written in three characters (like .txt, .zip, .exe, .png), so .yml conforms to this three-character convention. Developers who prefer concise notation often choose .yml.</p>\n<h2>YAML vs. JSON format differences</h2>\n<p>While JSON format uses curly braces to define requirements, YAML uses indentation to express structure, resulting in better readability. Compare the samples below.\nYou'll see that YAML prioritizes ease of use for programmers.\nYAML:\n<img alt=\"YAML key-value notation example\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1749687456/Blog/Content%20Images/yaml-coding-sample-01.png\" /></p>\n<p>JSON:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"JSON format key-value notation example\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1749687456/Blog/Content%20Images/json-format-coding-sample-01.png\" /></p>\n<h2>YAML vs. CUE comparison</h2>\n<p>While YAML has high readability and a simple structure, CUE integrates schemas and data, allowing complex configurations to be managed in a single file. CUE also has schema validation functionality that YAML alone cannot achieve, making it easier to ensure data consistency.</p>\n<p>Flexibility is another major characteristic. CUE is an open source language (specifically, a superset of JSON) used to define, generate, and validate all kinds of data, so it can integrate with many other languages like Go, JSON, OpenAPI, Protocol Buffers, and YAML.</p>\n<p>CUE also has scripting capabilities through the Go API, which comes in handy when displaying CUE-based manifests as final <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/kubernetes-the-container-orchestration-solution/\">Kubernetes</a> resource YAML or implementing commands to list resources for deployment to specific clusters.</p>\n<h2>YAML data structures and syntax (fundamentals)</h2>\n<h3>Important notes for writing YAML files</h3>\n<p>Remember that indentation and tabs are extremely important. Extra indentation or tabs can change the meaning of YAML objects, making these elements critical.</p>\n<h3>YAML data structures</h3>\n<p>YAML primarily consists of two types of data: collections and scalars. Collections are made up of sequences and mappings. Sequences are arrays, and mappings are name-value pairs (expressed as Key: Value arrays). Scalars are used to distinguish types and represent strings, numbers, and other values.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collections\n<ul>\n<li>Sequences</li>\n<li>Mappings</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Scalars</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Writing YAML syntax</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-line collections: Use the | (vertical bar) symbol when you need to preserve the format of multiple lines.</li>\n<li>Multi-line formatting: When you have long string values and need to write them across multiple lines while preserving the format, use &gt;.</li>\n<li>Lists: Lists are expressed using - (hyphens).</li>\n<li>Nesting: Nested data structures are expressed using indentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Using YAML in GitLab</h2>\n<p>GitLab <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/\">CI/CD</a> pipelines use a YAML file called <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/index.html\">.gitlab-ci.yml</a> for each project to define pipeline structure and execution order. The content configured in this file is processed within GitLab Runner. Please refer to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/\">this CI/CD YAML syntax</a>.</p>\n<h2>Let's edit a YAML file</h2>\n<p>Thanks to its simplicity and readability, YAML is widely used across various applications, including configuration files, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, documentation, and configuration management. Its readability enables developers and operations engineers to easily manage configurations and data, allowing them to work efficiently. Understanding YAML will make configuring various systems and tools simpler and more intuitive.</p>\n<h2>YAML FAQs</h2>\n<h3>What is YAML used for?</h3>\n<p>Thanks to its simplicity and readability, YAML is widely used across various applications including configuration files, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, documentation, and configuration management.</p>\n<h3>What's the difference between YAML and JSON?</h3>\n<p>While JSON files use curly braces to define requirements, YAML uses indentation to express structure, resulting in better readability. However, note that indentation and spacing are extremely important in YAML.</p>\n<h3>Why is YAML popular?</h3>\n<p>YAML is a popular data serialization language among developers because of its readability, versatility, and use of an indentation system similar to Python. YAML supports multiple data types and has parser libraries available for many programming languages, allowing it to handle various data serialization tasks and be utilized in a wide range of scenarios.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Upgrading applications to newer, supported versions of Java has traditionally been a tedious and time-consuming process. Development teams must spend countless hours learning about deprecated APIs, updated libraries, and new language features. In many cases, significant code rewrites are necessary, turning what should be a straightforward upgrade into a multi-week project that diverts resources from building new features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/duo-amazon-q/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</a> changes this paradigm entirely with AI-powered automation. What once took weeks can now be accomplished in minutes, with full traceability and ready-to-review merge requests that maintain your application's functionality while leveraging modern Java features.</p>\n<h2>How it works: Upgrade your Java application</h2>\n<p>Let's walk through how you can modernize a Java 8 application to Java 17.</p>\n<p><strong>Start with an issue</strong></p>\n<p>First, create an issue in your GitLab project describing your modernization goal. You don't need to specify version details - GitLab Duo with Amazon Q is able to detect that your application is currently built with Java 8 and needs to be upgraded. Simply describe that you want to refactor your code to Java 17 in the issue title and description.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger the transformation</strong></p>\n<p>Once your issue is created, invoke GitLab Duo with Amazon Q using the <code>/q transform</code> command in a comment on the issue. This simple command sets in motion an automated process that will analyze your entire codebase, create a comprehensive upgrade plan, and generate all necessary code changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Automated analysis and implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Amazon Q analyzes your Java 8 codebase to understand your application's structure, dependencies, and implementation patterns. It identifies deprecated features, determines which Java 17 constructs can replace existing code, and creates a merge request with all the necessary updates. The transformation updates not just your source code files — including CLI, GUI, and model classes — but also your build configuration files like <code>pom.xml</code> with Java 17 settings and dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Review and verification</strong></p>\n<p>The generated merge request provides a complete view of all changes. You can review how your code has been modernized with Java 17 language features and verify that all tests still pass. The beauty of this approach is that all functionality is preserved and your application works exactly the same way, just with improved, more modern code.</p>\n<h2>Why use GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</h2>\n<p>Leveraging GitLab Duo with Amazon Q for application modernization has a number of advantages for development teams:</p>\n<p><strong>Time reduction</strong>: What traditionally takes weeks of developer effort is reduced to hours or minutes, freeing your team to focus on building new features rather than managing technical debt.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimized risk</strong>: The automated analysis and transformation process reduces the risk of human error that often accompanies manual code migrations. Every change is traceable and reviewable through GitLab's merge request workflow.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete audit trail</strong>: Every transformation is documented through GitLab's version control, providing a clear record of what changed and why, which is essential for compliance and troubleshooting.</p>\n<p><strong>Enterprise-grade security</strong>: The integration leverages GitLab's end-to-end security features and AWS's robust cloud infrastructure, helping to ensure your code and data remain protected throughout the modernization process.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to see GitLab Duo with Amazon Q in action?

      "published": "2025-10-21T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Static application security testing (SAST) is critical to building secure software, helping teams identify vulnerabilities in code before they can be exploited. Last year, with GitLab 17.4, we <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-advanced-sast-is-now-generally-available/\">launched Advanced SAST</a> to deliver higher-quality scan results directly in developer workflows. Since then, Advanced SAST has powered millions of scans across over a hundred thousand codebases, reducing risk and helping customers build more secure applications from the start.</p>\n<p>We’re building on that foundation with a set of performance enhancements designed to improve accuracy and speed, so developers get results they can trust, without losing their flow. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-5-intelligence-that-moves-software-development-forward/\">New capabilities</a> include better out-of-the-box precision, the ability to add custom detection rules, and a trio of improvements to accelerate scan times through multi-core scanning, algorithmic optimizations, and diff-based scanning. Together, these improvements make <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast/\">Advanced SAST</a> smarter and faster, delivering security that’s developer-friendly by design.</p>\n<h2>SAST adoption hinges on both accuracy and speed</h2>\n<p>Most SAST programs rarely fail due to inaccurate vulnerability detection; they fail because developers don’t adopt security tooling. Too often, AppSec solutions like SAST deliver accuracy at the expense of the developer experience, or developer experience at the expense of accuracy. In reality, both are necessary. Without accuracy, developers don’t trust the results; without speed and usability, adoption lags.</p>\n<p>When both come together, security fits naturally into the development process — and that’s the only way security teams successfully drive SAST adoption at scale. This philosophy guides the GitLab roadmap for Advanced SAST.</p>\n<h2>Add custom detection rules for greater accuracy</h2>\n<p>The built-in Advanced SAST rules are informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. Until now, you could <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/customize_rulesets/\">disable rules</a> or adjust their name, description, or severity, but you couldn’t add new detection logic. With GitLab 18.5, teams can now define their own custom, pattern-based rules to catch organization-specific issues — like flagging banned function calls — while still using GitLab’s curated ruleset as the baseline. Any violations of custom rules are reported in the same place as built-in GitLab rules, so developers can glean information from a single dashboard.</p>\n<p>Custom rules are effective at catching straightforward issues that matter to your organization, but they don’t influence the taint analysis that Advanced SAST uses to catch injections and similar flaws. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. The result is higher-quality scan results tuned to your context, giving security teams more control and developers clearer, more actionable findings.</p>\n<h2>Faster scans to get developers in the flow</h2>\n<p>Speed matters. If a SAST scan takes too long, developers often switch to another task, so adoption suffers.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’ve invested in several performance-based enhancements to dramatically reduce scan times without compromising on accuracy, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-core scanning</strong>: Leverages multiple CPU cores on GitLab Runners</li>\n<li><strong>Diff-based scanning</strong>: Scans only the changed code in a merge request</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing optimizations</strong>: Smarter algorithms and engine enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These improvements build on each other, delivering faster scans with significant impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-core scanning typically reduces scan runtime by up to <strong>50%.</strong></li>\n<li>Diff-based scanning helps the most in large repositories, where less code is modified in each change. It’s specifically designed to give faster feedback in the code review process by delivering faster scans in merge requests. In our testing, many large repositories now take less than <strong>10 minutes to return results in MRs, where previously scans took more than 20 minutes.</strong></li>\n<li>In recent internal testing, algorithmic optimizations <strong>cut scan times by up to 71%</strong> on large open-source codebases, with Apache Lucene (Java) showing the biggest improvement. Other projects, including Django (Python), Kafka, and Zulip, also saw <strong>performance boosts of over 50% in single-core mode</strong>. You can see the results for yourself below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers, these improvements mean quicker feedback in merge requests, less waiting on security results, and a smoother path to adoption. And with multi-core scanning and diff-based analysis layered on top, the gains will be even greater.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"chart showing Python scan times\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760714805/rxl2zzo58j7y0k2ldxeq.png\" />\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"chart showing Java scan times\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760714805/hz9bsrir6nrqthkjddvi.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These performance gains reflect GitLab’s broader focus on improving the developer experience across our platform. For example, one of our customers recently transitioned to GitLab’s <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies/\">Pipeline Execution Policies</a> (PEP) to gain greater control and flexibility over how security scans run within their pipelines. By standardizing templates, adding caching, and optimizing pipeline logic, their teams cut dependency scan runtimes from <strong>15–60 minutes down to just 1–2 minutes per job — saving roughly 100,000 compute minutes every day across 15,000 scans</strong>. It’s a clear example of how more customizable and efficient pipeline execution policies lead to faster feedback loops, higher productivity, and broader adoption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With these latest enhancements, Advanced SAST gives security and development teams the accuracy, speed, and flexibility they need to keep up with modern software development. By reducing false positives, enabling custom detection, and accelerating scan times, we’re making security an enabler — not a blocker — for developers.</p>\n<p>Like all of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/application-security-testing/\">GitLab’s application security capabilities</a>, Advanced SAST is built directly into our DevSecOps platform, making security a natural part of how developers build, test, deploy, and secure software.</p>\n<p>The result: faster adoption, fewer bottlenecks, and more secure applications delivered from the start.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get started with Advanced SAST today!

Developers context-switch between planning backlogs, triaging security findings, reviewing code, and responding to CI/CD failures — losing hours to manual work. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/10/16/gitlab-18-5-released/\">GitLab 18.5</a> calms this chaos.</p>\n<p>At the heart of this release is a valuable improvement in overall usability of GitLab and how AI integrates into your user experience. A new panel-based UI makes it easier to see data in context, and allows GitLab Duo Chat to be persistently visible across the platform, wherever it is needed. Purpose-built agents tackle vulnerability triage and backlog management, and popular AI tools integrate with agentic workflows even more seamlessly than before. We’ve also extended our market-leading security capabilities to help you better identify exploitable vulnerabilities versus theoretical ones, distinguish active credentials from expired ones, and scan only changed code to keep developers in flow.</p>\n<h2>What’s new in 18.5</h2>\n<p>18.5 represents our biggest release so far this year — watch our introduction to the release, and read more details below.\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1128975773?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;GitLab_18.5 Release_101925_MP_v2&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<h3>Modern user experience with quick access to GitLab Duo everywhere</h3>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 delivers a modernized user experience with a more intuitive interface driven by a new panel-based layout.</p>\n<p>With panels, key information appears side by side so that you can work contextually, without losing your place. For example, when you click on an issue in the issues list, its details automatically open in a side panel. You can also launch the GitLab Duo panel on the right, bringing Duo wherever you are in GitLab. This lets you ask contextual questions or give instructions, right alongside your work.</p>\n<p>Several usability improvements make navigation easier. The global search box now appears at the top center for improved accessibility. Global navigation elements, including Issues, Merge Requests, To-Dos, and your avatar have moved to the top right. Additionally, the left sidebar is now collapsible and expandable, giving you more control over your workspace.</p>\n<p>Teams using experimental and GitLab Duo beta features will be the first to receive the new interface, followed by all GitLab.com users who will be able to turn this experience on using the toggle located under your user icon.

Please share your feedback or report any issues <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/577554\">here</a>, you're helping us shape a better GitLab!</p>\n<h3>Updates to GitLab Duo Agent Platform</h3>\n<p><strong>Security Analyst Agent: Transform manual vulnerability triage into intelligent automation</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab Duo <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/security_analyst_agent/\">Security Analyst Agent</a> automates vulnerability management workflows through AI-powered analysis, helping transform hours of manual triage into intelligent automation. Building on the Vulnerability Management Tools available through GitLab Duo Agentic Chat, Security Analyst Agent orchestrates multiple tools, applying security policies, and creating custom flows for recurring workflows automatically.</p>\n<p>Security teams can access enriched vulnerability data, including CVE details, static reachability analysis, and code flow information, while executing operations like dismissing false positives, confirming threats, adjusting severity levels, and creating linked issues for remediation — all through conversational AI. The agent reduces repetitive clicking through vulnerability dashboards and replaces custom scripts with simple natural language commands.</p>\n<p>For example, when a security scan reveals dozens of vulnerabilities, simply prompt: &quot;Dismiss vulnerabilities with reachable=FALSE and create issues for critical findings.&quot; Security Analyst Agent analyzes reachability data, applies security policies, and completes bulk operations in moments — helping decrease work that would otherwise take hours.</p>\n<p>While individual Vulnerability Management Tools can be accessed directly through Agentic Chat for specific tasks, Security Analyst Agent orchestrates these tools intelligently and automates complex multi-step workflows. Note that Vulnerability Management Tools are available through Agentic Chat on GitLab Self-managed and GitLab.com instances, and Security Analyst Agent is available on GitLab.com only for 18.5, while availability in Self-managed and Dedicated environments will come with our next release.\nWatch this demo:</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1128975984?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;18.5 Security Demo&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>GitLab Duo Planner: Turn backlog chaos into strategic clarity</strong></p>\n<p>Managing complex software delivery requires constant context-switching between planning tasks. <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/planner/\">GitLab Duo Planner</a> addresses the real-world planning challenges we see teams face every day. Duo Planner acts as your teammate with awareness of your project context, including how you manage issues, epics, and merge requests. Unlike generic AI assistants, it's purpose-built with deep knowledge of GitLab's planning workflows coupled with Agile and prioritization frameworks to help you balance effort, risk, and strategic alignment.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Planner can turn vague ideas into structured planning hierarchies, identify stale backlog items, and draft executive updates. For example, when refining your backlog with hundreds of issues accumulated over months, simply prompt: &quot;Identify stale backlog items and suggest priorities.&quot; Within seconds, you'll receive a structured summary showing issues without recent activity, items missing key details, duplicate work, and recommended priorities based on labels and milestones, complete with actionable recommendations.</p>\n<p>For teams managing complex roadmaps, the Planner aims to eliminate hours of manual analysis and context-switching, helping Product Managers and engineering leads make faster, more informed decisions. As of 18.5, GitLab Duo Planner is currently “read-only,” meaning that it can analyze, plan, and suggest, but cannot yet take direct action to modify anything. Please see our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/planner/\">documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensible Agent Catalog: Popular AI tools as native GitLab agents</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 introduces popular AI agents directly into the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/ai_catalog/\">AI Catalog</a>, making external tools like Claude, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer, and OpenCode available as native GitLab agents. Users can now discover, configure, and deploy these agents through the same unified catalog interface used for GitLab's built-in agents, with automatic syncing of foundational agents across organization catalogs.</p>\n<p>This eliminates the complexity of manual agent setup by providing a point-and-click catalog experience while maintaining enterprise-grade security through GitLab's authentication and audit systems. GitLab Duo Enterprise subscriptions now include built-in usage of Claude and Codex within GitLab, allowing you to use your existing GitLab subscription for these tools without requiring separate API keys or additional billing setup. Other agents may still require separate subscriptions and configuration while we finalize our integration plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-hosted GitLab Duo Agent Platform (Beta): Address data sovereignty requirements without sacrificing AI power</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 moves GitLab Duo Agent Platform's self-hosted capabilities from experimental to beta, enabling organizations to execute AI agents and flows entirely within their own infrastructure — critical for regulated industries and data sovereignty requirements. The beta release includes improved timeout configurations and AI Gateway settings, allowing teams to use AI agents for code reviews, bug fixes, and feature implementations, while providing enterprise-grade security for sensitive code.</p>\n<h2>Smarter, faster security: Prioritize real risks and keep developers in the flow</h2>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 introduces new application security capabilities that help teams focus on exploitable risk, reduce noise, and strengthen software supply chain security. These updates continue our commitment to building security directly into the development process — delivering precision, speed, and insight without disrupting developer flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Static Reachability Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>With over <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/\">37,000 new CVEs</a> issued this year, security teams face an overwhelming volume of vulnerabilities and struggle to understand which ones are truly exploitable. Static Reachability Analysis, now in limited availability, brings library-level precision by helping to identify whether vulnerable code is actually invoked in your application, not just present in dependencies.</p>\n<p>Paired with our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/risk_assessment_data/\">recently released</a> Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) and Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) data, security teams can more effectively accelerate vulnerability triage and prioritize real risks to help strengthen overall supply chain security. In 18.5, we’re adding support for Java, alongside existing support for Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Validity Checks</strong></p>\n<p>Just as Static Reachability Analysis helps teams prioritize exploitable vulnerabilities from open source dependencies, Secret Validity Checks bring the same insight to exposed secrets — currently available in beta on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed. For GitLab-issued security tokens, instead of manually verifying whether a leaked credential or API key is active, GitLab automatically distinguishes active secrets from expired ones directly in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/\">Vulnerability Report</a>. This helps enable security and development teams to focus remediation efforts on genuine risks. Support for AWS- and GCP-issued secrets is planned for future releases.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom rules for Advanced SAST</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced SAST runs on rules informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. However, some teams required additional flexibility to tune the SAST engine for their specific organization. With Custom Rules for Advanced SAST, AppSec teams can define atomic, pattern-based detection logic to help capture security issues specific to their organization — like flagging banned function calls — while still using GitLab’s curated ruleset as the baseline. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. While these rules will not support taint analysis, they do give organizations greater flexibility in achieving accurate SAST results.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced SAST C and C++ language support</strong></p>\n<p>We’re expanding our language coverage for Advanced SAST to include C and C++, which are widely used languages in embedded systems software development. To enable scanning, projects must generate a compilation database that captures compiler commands and includes paths used during builds. This works to ensure the scanner can accurately parse and analyze source files, delivering precise, context-aware results that help security teams identify real vulnerabilities in the development process. The implementation requirements for C and C++ require specific configurations, which can be found in our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/cpp_advanced_sast/\">documentation</a>. Advanced SAST C and C++ support are currently available in beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Diff-based SAST scanning</strong></p>\n<p>Traditional SAST scans re-analyze entire codebases with every commit, slowing pipelines and disrupting developer flow. The developer experience is a critical consideration that can make or break the adoption of application security testing. Diff-based SAST scanning aims to speed up scan times by focusing only on the code changed in a merge request, reducing redundant analysis and surfacing relevant results tied to the developer’s work. By aligning scans with actual code changes, GitLab delivers faster, more focused feedback that helps keep developers in flow while maintaining strong security coverage.</p>\n<h2>Simplify API configurations</h2>\n<p>API-driven workflows offer power and flexibility, but they can also create unnecessary complexity for tasks that teams need to perform regularly. The new Maven Virtual Registry interface brings a UI layer to these operations.</p>\n<h3>Maven Virtual Registry interface</h3>\n<p>The new web-based interface for managing Maven Virtual Registries turns complex API configurations into visual simplicity, providing a more intuitive experience for package administrators and platform engineers.</p>\n<p>Previously, teams configured and maintained virtual registries only through API calls, which made routine maintenance time-consuming and required specialized platform knowledge. The new interface removes that barrier, helping to make everyday tasks faster and easier.</p>\n<p>With this update, you can now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create virtual registries to simplify dependency configuration</li>\n<li>Create and order upstreams to help improve performance and compliance</li>\n<li>Browse and clear stale cache entries directly in the UI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This visual experience helps reduce operational overhead and provides development teams with clearer insight into how dependencies are resolved, enabling them to make better decisions about build performance and security policies.</p>\n<p>Watch a demo:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiOZJPhAvaI?si=cYaoR_OIgqFKbyM2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>We invite enterprise customers to join the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/543045\">Maven Virtual Registry Beta program</a> and share feedback to help shape the final release.</p>\n<h2>AI that adapts to your workflow</h2>\n<p>This release represents more than new capabilities — it's about choice and control.

      "published": "2025-10-16T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Software projects have different evolving needs and requirements. Some have\nsaid that <em>software is never finished, merely abandoned</em>. Some software\nprojects are small and others are large with complex integrations. Some have\ndependencies on external projects, while others are self-contained.\nRegardless of the size and complexity, the need to validate and ensure\nfunctionality remains paramount.</p>\n<p>CI/CD pipelines can help with the challenge of building and validating software projects consistently, but, much like the software itself, these pipelines can become complex with many dependencies. This is where ideas like <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines/#parent-child-pipelines\">parent-child pipelines</a> and data exchange in CI/CD setups become incredibly important.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will cover common CI/CD data exchange challenges users may encounter with parent-child pipelines in GitLab — and how to solve them. You'll learn how to turn complex CI/CD processes into more manageable setups.</p>\n<h2>Using parent-child pipelines</h2>\n<p>The pipeline setup in the image below illustrates a scenario where a project could require a large, complex pipeline. The whole project resides in one repository and contains different modules. Each module requires its own set of build and test automation steps.</p>\n<p>One approach to address the CI/CD configuration in a scenario like this is to break down the larger pipeline into smaller ones (i.e., child pipelines) and keep a common CI/CD process that is shared across all modules in charge of the whole orchestration (i.e., parent pipeline).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"CI/CD configuration\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617772/hizwvhmgxn6exbmvsnrv.png\" /></p>\n<p>The parent-child pipeline pattern allows a single pipeline to orchestrate one or many downstream pipelines. Similar to how a single pipeline coordinates the execution of multiple <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/\">jobs</a>, the parent pipeline coordinates the running of full pipelines with one or more jobs.</p>\n<p>This pattern has been shown to be helpful in a variety of use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Breaking down large, complex pipelines into smaller, manageable pieces</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conditionally executing certain pipelines as part of a larger CI/CD process</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Executing pipelines in parallel</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Helping manage user permissions to access and run certain pipelines</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab’s current CI/CD structure supports this pattern and makes it simple to implement parent-child pipelines. While there are many benefits when using the parent-child pipeline pattern with GitLab, one question we often get is how to share data between the parent and child pipelines. In the next sections, we’ll go over how to make use of GitLab variables and artifacts to address this concern.</p>\n<h3>Sharing variables</h3>\n<p>There are cases where it is necessary to pass the output from a parent pipeline job to a child pipeline. These outputs can be shared as variables, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/job_artifacts/\">artifacts</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/inputs/\">inputs</a>.</p>\n<p>Consider a case where we create a custom variable <code>var_1</code> during the runtime of a job:</p>\n<pre><code>\nstages:\n  - build\n  - triggers\n\n# This job only creates a variable \n\ncreate_var_job:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - var_1=&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable&quot;\n    - echo &quot;var_1=$var_1&quot; &gt;&gt; var.env\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: var.env\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the variable is created as part of the script steps in the job (during runtime). In this example, we are using a simple string <code>&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable&quot;</code> to illustrate the main syntax required to later share this variable with a child pipeline. Let's break down the <code>create_var_job</code>  and analyze the main steps from this GitLab job</p>\n<p>First, we need to save <code>var_1</code> as <code>dotenv</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>  script:\n    - var_1=&quot;Hi, I'm a pipeline variable&quot;\n    - echo &quot;var_1=$var_1&quot; &gt;&gt; var.env\n</code></pre>\n<p>After saving <code>var_1</code> as <code>var.env</code>, the next important step is to make this variable available as an artifact produced by the <code>create_var_job</code>. To do that, we use the following syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>\nartifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: var.env\n</code></pre>\n<p>Up to this point, we have created a variable during runtime and saved it as a <code>dotenv</code> report. Now let's add the job that should trigger the child pipeline:</p>\n<pre><code>\ntelco_service_a:\n  stage: triggers\n  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n  rules:\n    - changes:\n        - service_a/*\n</code></pre>\n<p>The goal of <code>telco_service_a</code>  job is to find the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> configuration of the child pipeline,  which is defined in this case as <code>service_a,</code> and trigger its execution. Let's examine this job:</p>\n<pre><code>\ntelco_service_a:\n  stage: triggers\n  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>We see it belongs to another <code>stage</code> of the pipeline named <code>triggers.</code>This job will run only after <code>create_var_job</code> from the first stage successfully finishes and where the variable  <code>var_1</code> we want to pass is created.</p>\n<p>After defining the stage, we use the reserved words <code>trigger</code> and <code>include</code> to tell GitLab where to search for the child pipeline configuration, as illustrated in the YAML below:</p>\n<pre><code>  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our child-pipeline YAML configuration is under <code>service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml</code> folder in the GitLab repository, for this example.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"child-pipeline YAML configuration\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617772/ujkirpbifthpuujkcm6f.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Child pipelines folders with configurations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>Take into consideration that the repository structure depicted above can vary. What matters is properly pointing the  <code>triggers: include</code> properties at the location of your child-pipeline configuration in your repository.</p>\n<p>Finally, we use <code>rules: changes</code> to indicate to GitLab that this child pipeline should be triggered only if there is any change in any file in the <code>service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml</code> directory, as illustrated in the following code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>\nrules:\n    - changes:\n        - service_a/*\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using this rule helps to optimize cost by triggering the child pipeline job only when necessary. This approach is particularly valuable in a monorepo architecture where specific modules contain numerous components, allowing us to avoid running their dedicated pipelines when no changes have been made to their respective codebases.</p>\n<h4>Configuring the parent pipeline</h4>\n<p>Up to this point, we have put together our parent pipeline. Here's the full code snippet for this segment:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# Parent Pipeline Configuration\n\n# This pipeline creates a custom variable and triggers a child pipeline\n\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - trigger\n\ncreate_var_job:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - var_1=&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable&quot;\n    - echo &quot;var_1=$var_1&quot; &gt;&gt; var.env\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: var.env\n\ntelco_service_a:\n  stage: triggers\n  trigger:\n    include: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n  rules:\n    - changes:\n        - service_a/*\n</code></pre>\n<p>When GitLab executes the YAML configuration in the GitLab UI, the parent pipeline gets rendered as follows:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"parent pipeline rendering\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617771/e1azkkr0rnzd42dzkw1x.png\" /></p>\n<p>Notice the label &quot;trigger job,&quot; which indicates this job will start the execution of another pipeline configuration.</p>\n<h4>Configuring the child pipeline</h4>\n<p>Moving forward, let's now focus on the child pipeline configuration, where we expect to inherit and print the value of the <code>var_1</code> created in the parent pipeline.</p>\n<p>The pipeline configuration in <code>service_a/.gitlab_ci.yml</code> has the following definition:</p>\n<pre><code>\nstages:\n  - build\n\nbuild_a:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;this job inherits the variable from the Parent pipeline:&quot;\n    - echo $var_1\n  needs:\n    - project: gitlab-da/use-cases/7-4-parent-child-pipeline\n      job: create_var_job\n      ref: main\n      artifacts: true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Like before, let's break down this pipeline and highlight the main parts to achieve our goal. This pipeline only contains one stage (i.e., <code>build)</code> and one job (i.e., <code>build_a)</code>. The script in the job contains two steps:</p>\n<pre><code>\nbuild_a:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;this job inherits the variable from the Parent pipeline:&quot;\n    - echo $var_1\n</code></pre>\n<p>These two steps print output during the execution. The most interesting one is the second step, <code>echo $var_1</code>, where we expect to print the variable value inherited from the parent pipeline. Remember, this was a simple string with value: <code>&quot;Hi, I'm a Parent pipeline variable.&quot;</code></p>\n<h4>Inheriting variables using needs</h4>\n<p>To set and link this job to inherit variables from the parent pipeline, we use the reserved GitLab CI properties <code>needs</code> as depicted in the following snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>\nneeds:\n    - project: gitlab-da/use-cases/7-4-parent-child-pipeline\n      job: create_var_job\n      ref: main\n      artifacts: true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using the &quot;needs&quot; keyword, we define dependencies that must be completed before running this job. In this case, we pass four different values. Let's walk through each one  of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Project:</strong> The complete namespace of the project where the main <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> containing the parent pipeline YAML is located. Make sure to include the absolute path.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Job:</strong> The specific job name in the parent pipeline from where we want to inherit the variable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ref:</strong> The name of the branch where the main <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> containing the parent pipeline YAML is located.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Artifacts:</strong> Where we set a boolean value, indicating that artifacts from the parent pipeline job should be downloaded and made available to this child pipeline job.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This specific approach using the needs property is only available to GitLab Premium and Ultimate users. We will cover another example for GitLab community users later on.</p>\n<h4>Putting it all together</h4>\n<p>Now let's assume we make a change to any of the files under <code>service_a</code> folder and commit the changes to the repository. When GitLab detects the change, the rule we set up will trigger the child job pipeline execution. This gets displayed in the GitLab UI as follows:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Rule triggering the child job pipeline execution\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617771/e1azkkr0rnzd42dzkw1x.png\" /></p>\n<p>Clicking on the <code>telco_service_a</code>  will take us to the jobs in the child pipeline:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Jobs in pipeline\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617773/vftjkg7ct2wqmew1e3yk.png\" /></p>\n<p>We can see the parent-child relationship, and finally, by clicking on the <code>build_a job</code>, we can visually verify the variable inheritance in the job execution log:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Verifying the variable inheritance in the job execution log\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760617758/hxfkfmev9hebbqhgcvoh.png\" /></p>\n<p>This output confirms the behavior we expected. The custom runtime variable <code>var_1</code> created in the parent job is inherited in the child job, unpacked from the <code>dotenv</code> report, and its value accessible as can be confirmed in Line 26 above.</p>\n<p>This use case illustrates how to share custom variables that can contain any value between pipelines. This example is intentionally simple and can be extrapolated to more realistic scenarios. Take, for instance, the following CI/CD configuration, where the custom variable we need to share is the tag of a Docker image:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# Pipeline \n\n\nbuild-prod-image:\n  tags: [ saas-linux-large-amd64 ]\n  image: docker:20.10.16\n  stage: build\n  services:\n    - docker:20.10.16-dind\n  \n  script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n    - docker build -t $PRODUCTION_IMAGE .\n    - docker push $PRODUCTION_IMAGE\n    - echo &quot;UPSTREAM_CONTAINER_IMAGE=$PRODUCTION_IMAGE&quot; &gt;&gt; prodimage.env\n\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: prodimage.env\n\n  rules:\n     - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == &quot;main&quot;'\n       when: always\n     - when: never\n</code></pre>\n<p>And use the variable with the Docker image tag, in another job that updates a Helm manifest file:</p>\n<pre><code>\nupdate-helm-values:\n    stage: update-manifests\n    image:\n        name: alpine:3.16\n        entrypoint: [&quot;&quot;]\n  \n    before_script:\n         - apk add --no-cache git curl bash yq\n         - git remote set-url origin https://${CI_USERNAME}:${GITOPS_USER}@${SERVER_PATH}/${PROJECT_PATH}\n         - git config --global user.email &quot;gitlab@gitlab.com&quot;\n         - git config --global user.name &quot;GitLab GitOps&quot;\n         - git pull origin main\n    script:\n          - cd src\n          - echo $UPSTREAM_CONTAINER_IMAGE\n          - yq eval -i &quot;.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image |= \\&quot;$UPSTREAM_CONTAINER_IMAGE\\&quot;&quot; store-deployment.yaml\n          - cat store-deployment.yaml\n          - git pull origin main\n          - git checkout -B main\n          - git commit -am '[skip ci] prod image update'\n          - git push origin main\n    needs:\n      - project: gitlab-da/use-cases/devsecops-platform/simply-find/simply-find-front-end\n        job: build-prod-image\n        ref: main\n        artifacts: true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Mastering how to share variables between pipelines while maintaining the relationship between them enables us to create more sophisticated workflow orchestration that can meet our software building needs.</p>\n<h3>Using GitLab Package Registry to share artifacts</h3>\n<p>While the needs feature mentioned above works great for Premium and Ultimate users, GitLab also has features to help achieve similar results for Community Edition users. One suggested approach is to store artifacts in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/package_registry/\">GitLab Package Registry</a>.</p>\n<p>Using a combination of the variables provided in GitLab CI/CD jobs and the GitLab API, you can upload artifacts to the GitLab Package Registry from a parent pipeline. In the child pipeline, you can then access the uploaded artifact from the package registry using the same variables and API to access the artifact. Let’s take a look at the example pipeline and some supplementary scripts that illustrate this:</p>\n<p><strong>gitlab-ci.yml (parent pipeline)</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\n# Parent Pipeline Configuration\n\n# This pipeline creates an artifact, uploads it to Package Registry, and triggers a child pipeline\n\n\nstages:\n  - create-upload\n  - trigger\n\nvariables:\n  PACKAGE_NAME: &quot;pipeline-artifacts&quot;\n  PACKAGE_VERSION: &quot;$CI_PIPELINE_ID&quot;\n  ARTIFACT_FILE: &quot;artifact.txt&quot;\n\n# Job 1: Create and upload artifact to Package Registry\n\ncreate-and-upload-artifact:\n  stage: create-upload\n  image: alpine:latest\n  before_script:\n    - apk add --no-cache curl bash\n  script:\n    - bash scripts/create-artifact.sh\n    - bash scripts/upload-to-registry.sh\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == &quot;push&quot;\n\n# Job 2: Trigger child pipeline\n\ntrigger-child:\n  stage: trigger\n  trigger:\n    include: child-pipeline.yml\n    strategy: depend\n  variables:\n    PARENT_PIPELINE_ID: $CI_PIPELINE_ID\n    PACKAGE_NAME: $PACKAGE_NAME\n    PACKAGE_VERSION: $PACKAGE_VERSION\n    ARTIFACT_FILE: $ARTIFACT_FILE\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == &quot;push&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>child-pipeline.yml</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\n# Child Pipeline Configuration\n\n# This pipeline downloads the artifact from Package Registry and processes it\n\n\nstages:\n  - download-process\n\nvariables:\n  # These variables are passed from the parent pipeline\n  PACKAGE_NAME: &quot;pipeline-artifacts&quot;\n  PACKAGE_VERSION: &quot;$PARENT_PIPELINE_ID&quot;\n  ARTIFACT_FILE: &quot;artifact.txt&quot;\n\n# Job 1: Download and process artifact from Package Registry\n\ndownload-and-process-artifact:\n  stage: download-process\n  image: alpine:latest\n  before_script:\n    - apk add --no-cache curl bash\n  script:\n    - bash scripts/download-from-registry.sh\n    - echo &quot;Processing downloaded artifact...&quot;\n    - cat $ARTIFACT_FILE\n    - echo &quot;Artifact processed successfully!&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>upload-to-registry.sh</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nset -e\n\n\n# Configuration\n\nPACKAGE_NAME=&quot;${PACKAGE_NAME:-pipeline-artifacts}&quot;\n\nPACKAGE_VERSION=&quot;${PACKAGE_VERSION:-$CI_PIPELINE_ID}&quot;\n\nARTIFACT_FILE=&quot;${ARTIFACT_FILE:-artifact.txt}&quot;\n\n\n# Validate required variables\n\nif [ -z &quot;$CI_PROJECT_ID&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Error: CI_PROJECT_ID is not set&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\nif [ -z &quot;$CI_JOB_TOKEN&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Error: CI_JOB_TOKEN is not set&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\nif [ -z &quot;$CI_API_V4_URL&quot; ]; then\n    echo &quot;Error: CI_API_V4_URL is not set&quot;\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\nif [ !

The script gives the artifact a name and version and constructs the API call to upload the file to the package registry. The parent pipeline is able to authenticate using a <code>$CI_JOB_TOKEN</code> to push the artifact.txt file to the registry.</p>\n<p>The child pipeline operates the same as the parent pipeline by using a script to construct the API call to download the artifact.txt file from the package registry. It also is able to authenticate to the registry using the <code>$CI_JOB_TOKEN</code>.</p>\n<p>Since the GitLab Package Registry is available to all GitLab users, it helps to serve as a central location for storing and versioning artifacts. It is a great option for users working with many kinds of artifacts and needing to version artifacts for workflows even beyond CI/CD.</p>\n<h3>Using inputs to pass variables to a child pipeline</h3>\n<p>If you made it this far in this tutorial, and you have plans to start creating new pipeline configurations, you might want to start by evaluating if your use case can benefit from using <strong>inputs</strong> to pass variables to other pipelines.</p>\n<p>Using inputs is a recommended way to pass variables when you need to define specific values in a CI/CD job and have those values remain fixed during the pipeline run. Inputs might offer certain advantages over the method we implemented before. For example, with inputs, you can include data validation through options (i.e., values must be one of these: [‘staging', ‘prod’]), variable descriptions, type checking, and assign default values before the pipeline run.</p>\n<h4>Configuring CI/CD inputs</h4>\n<p>Consider the following parent pipeline configuration:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# .gitlab-ci.yml (main file)\n\nstages:\n - trigger\n\ntrigger-staging:\n stage: trigger\n trigger:\n   include:\n     - local: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n       inputs:\n         environment: staging\n         version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's zoom in at the main difference between the code snippet above and the previous parent pipeline examples in this tutorial:</p>\n<pre><code>\ntrigger:\n   include:\n     - local: service_a/.gitlab-ci.yml\n       inputs:\n         environment: staging\n         version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The main difference is using the reserved word &quot;inputs&quot;. This part of the YAML configuration can be read in natural language as: “trigger the child pipeline defined in <code>service_a.gitlab-ci.yml</code> and make sure to pass ‘environment: staging’ and ‘version:1.0.0’ as input variables that the child pipeline will know how to use.</p>\n<h4>Reading CI/CD inputs in child pipelines</h4>\n<p>Moving to the child pipeline, it must contain in its declaration a spec that defines the inputs it can take. For each input, it is possible to add a little description, a set of predefined options the input value can take, and the type of value it will take. This is illustrated as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>\n# target pipeline or child-pipeline in this case\n\n\nspec:\n  inputs:\n    environment:\n      description: &quot;Deployment environment&quot;\n      options: [staging, production]\n    version:\n      type: string\n      description: &quot;Application version&quot;\n\n\n---\n\n\nstages:\n  - deploy\n# Jobs that will use the inputs\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n     -  echo &quot;Deploying version $[[ inputs.version ]] to $[[ inputs.environment ]]&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice from the code snippet that after defining the spec, there is a YAML document separator &quot;---&quot;  followed by the actual child pipeline definition where we access the variables <code>$[[ inputs.version ]]</code> and <code>$[[ inputs.environment ]]&quot;</code> from the defined inputs using input interpolation.</p>\n<h2>Get hands-on with parent-child pipelines, artifacts, and more</h2>\n<p>We hope this article has helped with navigating the challenge of sharing variables and artifacts in parent-child pipeline setups.</p>\n<p>To try these examples for yourself, feel free to view or fork the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/devsecops-platform/devops-platform-wave/scenarios/scenario7-deep-dive-into-build-automation-and-ci/7-4-parent-child-pipeline/-/tree/main\">Premium/Ultimate</a> and the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/playground/dhelfand/parent-child-pipeline-with-package-registry-artifacts\">GitLab Package Registry</a> examples of sharing artifacts.</p>\n<p>You can also sign up for a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">30-day free trial of GitLab Ultimate</a> to experience all the features GitLab has to offer.

      "summary": "<p>Recently, the GitLab Data team transformed scattered\n<a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> applications into a unified, secure, and\nscalable solution for our Snowflake environment. To accomplish this, we\npacked Python, Snowflake, and Streamlit together with GitLab. Follow along\non this journey and discover the results we achieved, and learn how you can,\ntoo.</p>\n<h2>The challenge</h2>\n<p>Imagine this scenario: Your organization has dozens of Streamlit applications across different environments, running various Python versions, connecting to sensitive data with inconsistent security practices. Some apps work, others break mysteriously, and nobody knows who built what or how to maintain them.</p>\n<p>This was exactly the challenge our data team faced. Applications were being created in isolation, with no standardization, no security oversight, and no clear deployment process. The result? A compliance nightmare and a maintenance burden that was growing exponentially.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Functional architectural design (high level)\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760035999/i50lpkrwy9bok056rdak.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Functional architectural design (high level)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>How we started</h2>\n<p>We leveraged our unique position as customer zero by building this entire framework on GitLab's own CI/CD infrastructure and project management tools. Here are the ingredients we started with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/platform/\">GitLab</a> (product)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/platform/\">Snowflake</a> - our single source of truth (SSOT) for the data warehouse activities (and more than that)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> - an open-source tool for visual applications that has pure Python code under the hood</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This provided us with immediate access to enterprise-grade DevSecOps capabilities, enabling us to implement automated testing, code review processes, and deployment pipelines from the outset. By utilizing GitLab's built-in features for issue tracking, merge requests, and automated deployments (CI/CD pipelines), we can iterate rapidly and validate the framework against real-world enterprise requirements. This internal-first approach ensured our solution was battle-tested on GitLab's own infrastructure before any external implementation.</p>\n<h3>The lessons we learned</h3>\n<p>The most critical lesson we learned from building the Streamlit Application Framework in Snowflake is that <strong>structure beats chaos every time</strong> — implement governance early rather than retrofitting it later when maintenance becomes exponential.</p>\n<p>You also need to clearly define roles and responsibilities, separating infrastructure concerns from application development, so that each team can focus on its strengths.</p>\n<p>Security and compliance cannot be afterthoughts; they must be built into templates and automated processes from day one, as it's far easier to enforce consistent standards upfront than to force them after the fact. Invest heavily in automation and CI/CD pipelines, as manual processes don't scale and introduce human error.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Architecture of the framework (general overview)\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760035998/qt9gfemxjnj8kjumkuh7.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Architecture of the framework (general overview)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>How the Streamlit Application Framework changes everything</h2>\n<p>The Streamlit Application Framework turns a scattered approach into a structure. It gives developers freedom within secure guardrails, while automating deployment and eliminating maintenance complexity.</p>\n<h3>Three clear roles, one unified process</h3>\n<p>The framework introduces a structured approach with three distinct roles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Maintainers</strong> (Data team members and contributors) handle the infrastructure, including CI/CD pipelines, security templates, and compliance rules. They ensure the framework runs smoothly and stays secure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Creators</strong> (those who need to build applications) can focus on what they do best: creating visualizations, connecting to Snowflake data, and building user experiences. They have full flexibility to create new applications from scratch, add new pages to existing apps, integrate additional Python libraries, and build complex data visualisations — all without worrying about deployment pipelines or security configurations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Viewers</strong> (end users) access polished, secure applications without any technical overhead. All they need is Snowflake access.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Roles overview and their functionality\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760035999/oatqyx3ug7vsgzishpma.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overview of roles and their functions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>Automate everything</h2>\n<p>By implementing CI/CD, days of manual deployments and configuration headaches are gone.

Every application adheres to the same security standards, and compliance requirements are automatically enforced. Audit trails are maintained throughout the development lifecycle.</p>\n<p>We introduce our compliance rules and verify them with a single command.

Migrate to s3_v2 for better performance and reliability.</p>\n<h2>Disable proxy download for performance</h2>\n<p>Set <code>proxy_download</code> to <strong>false</strong> (default) for direct downloads:</p>\n<pre><code># For GitLab objects - can be set globally\n\ngitlab_rails['object_store']['proxy_download'] = false\n\n# Or configure per bucket for granular control\n\ngitlab_rails['object_store']['objects']['artifacts']['proxy_download'] = false\n\ngitlab_rails['object_store']['objects']['lfs']['proxy_download'] = false\n\ngitlab_rails['object_store']['objects']['uploads']['proxy_download'] = true  # Example: keep proxy for uploads\n\n# Container registry defaults to redirect mode (direct downloads)\n\n# Only disable if your environment requires it:\n\nregistry['storage']['redirect']['disable'] = false  # Keep as false\n\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> The <code>proxy_download</code> option can be configured globally at the object-store level or individually per bucket. This gives you flexibility to optimize based on your specific use case — for example, you might want direct downloads for large artifacts and LFS files, but proxy smaller uploads through GitLab for additional security controls.</p>\n<p>This dramatically reduces server load and egress costs by letting clients download directly from object storage.</p>\n<h2>Choose identity-based authentication</h2>\n<p><strong>AWS:</strong> Use IAM roles instead of access keys:</p>\n<pre><code># GitLab objects\n\ngitlab_rails['object_store']['connection'] = {\n  'provider' =&gt; 'AWS',\n  'use_iam_profile' =&gt; true\n}\n\n# Container registry\n\nregistry['storage'] = {\n  's3_v2' =&gt; {\n    'bucket' =&gt; 'gitlab-registry',\n    'region' =&gt; 'us-east-1'\n    # No access keys = IAM role authentication\n  }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Google Cloud Platform:</strong> Enable application default credentials:</p>\n<pre><code>\ngitlab_rails['object_store']['connection'] = {\n  'provider' =&gt; 'Google',\n  'google_application_default' =&gt; true\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Azure:</strong> Use workload identities by omitting storage access keys.</p>\n<h2>Add encryption layers</h2>\n<p>Enable server-side encryption for additional security:</p>\n<pre><code># GitLab objects\n\ngitlab_rails['object_store']['storage_options'] = {\n  'server_side_encryption' =&gt; 'AES256'\n}\n\n# Container registry\n\nregistry['storage'] = {\n  's3_v2' =&gt; {\n    'bucket' =&gt; 'gitlab-registry',\n    'encrypt' =&gt; true\n  }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>For AWS KMS encryption, specify the key ARN in <code>server_side_encryption_kms_key_id</code>.</p>\n<h2>Use separate buckets for organization</h2>\n<p>Create dedicated buckets for each component:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gitlab-artifacts</strong> - CI/CD job artifacts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gitlab-lfs</strong> - Git LFS objects</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gitlab-uploads</strong> - User uploads</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gitlab-packages</strong> - Package registry</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>gitlab-registry</strong> - Container images</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isolation improves security, enables granular access controls, and simplifies cost tracking.</p>\n<h2>Key configuration differences</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Consolidated Form</th>\n<th>Identity Auth</th>\n<th>Encryption</th>\n<th>Direct Downloads</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Artifacts, LFS, Packages</td>\n<td>✅ Supported</td>\n<td>✅ use_iam_profile</td>\n<td>✅ storage_options</td>\n<td>✅ proxy_download: false</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Container Registry</td>\n<td>❌ Separate config</td>\n<td>✅ Omit access keys</td>\n<td>✅ encrypt: true</td>\n<td>✅ redirect enabled by default</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Migration path</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Start with GitLab objects:</strong> Use the consolidated form for immediate complexity reduction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configure registry separately:</strong> Use s3_v2 driver with IAM authentication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enable encryption:</strong> Add server-side encryption for both components.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize performance:</strong> Ensure direct downloads are enabled with appropriate <code>proxy_download</code> settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Set up lifecycle policies:</strong> Configure S3 lifecycle rules to clean up incomplete multipart uploads.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Additional resources</h2>\n<p>For a complete AWS S3 configuration example, see the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/object_storage/#aws-s3\">GitLab documentation on AWS S3 object storage setup</a>.</p>\n<p>For more details on configuring proxy_download parameters per bucket, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/object_storage/#configure-the-parameters-of-each-object\">GitLab object storage configuration documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><em>These configurations will scale with your growth while maintaining security and performance.

Instead of authentication being done based on something a workload knows, for example passwords or API tokens, authentication is done based on what the workload <em>is</em>. The heart of workload identity federation is asymmetric cryptography. By leveraging public / private key pairs, tokens can be issued to workloads, such as Droplets, and used for authentication and authorization to APIs exposed by resource servers. Workload identity tokens are exchanged for domain specific access tokens, or grant access to resources directly.</p>\n<p>This series showcases how we can use DigitalOcean’s OAuth API and fine grained permission scopes to implement and leverage workload identity federation using OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol tokens. We’ll enable secretless access to DigitalOcean hosted databases and Spaces buckets from Droplets and GitHub Actions workflows. Eliminating the need to provision static, long-lived credentials for databases and Spaces buckets for those environments.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Workload identity RBAC\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/OAuthAppbasedWorkloadIdentityforDropletsBlogPostImages_2025_10_21_07_21/image_1.png\" /><figcaption>Workload identity RBAC</figcaption></figure>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"security-properties\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#security-properties\">Security properties</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#security-properties\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Authentication based on what the workload <em>is</em> requires that the infrastructure orchestrating the workload be able to make verifiable claims about a workload’s properties. To do this, the infrastructure responsible for running the workload enables issuance of workload-specific tokens containing these claims. The security of workload identity hinges on proper validation of these tokens per the OIDC protocol specification, the claims defined by each token, and the RBAC configuration used to validate tokens based on their claims.</p>\n<p>OIDC tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). These tokens are cryptographicly signed using a private key. The private key’s corresponding public key is made available via the JSON Web Key (JWK) format at a RFC 8615 “well known URI”. The URI of the public key is then referenced by a JSON format OpenID Configuration which is hosted at another well known URI.</p>\n<h4 id=\"well-known-openid-configuration\">/.well-known/openid-configuration</h4>\n<div class=\"code-label\" title=\"\"></div>\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">&quot;issuer&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;https://&lt;deployment-name&gt;.ondigitalocean.app&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">&quot;jwks_uri&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;https://&lt;deployment-name&gt;.ondigitalocean.app/.well-known/jwks&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">&quot;response_types_supported&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">&quot;id_token&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">&quot;claims_supported&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">&quot;sub&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;aud&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;exp&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;iat&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;iss&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">&quot;id_token_signing_alg_values_supported&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">&quot;RS256&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">&quot;scopes_supported&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">&quot;openid&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> \n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"well-known-jwks\">/.well-known/jwks</h4>\n<div class=\"code-label\" title=\"\"></div>\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token property\">&quot;keys&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n            <span class=\"token property\">&quot;kty&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;RSA&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n            <span class=\"token property\">&quot;n&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;jplR2Q2_hJeA0tqAMqRppJxu16H8i8nrSgX...&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n            <span class=\"token property\">&quot;e&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;AQAB&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n            <span class=\"token property\">&quot;use&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;sig&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n            <span class=\"token property\">&quot;kid&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;g1uTyq-nvRAVGYg6doHZ7LJVuNznJ1QX6OxVebUX6eE&quot;</span>\n\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> \n</code></pre>\n<p>These well known URIs are what make workload identity federation possible. Federation in this context means distinct services are interoperable for the purposes of confirming the identity of a workload by services other than the issuer of the token. Later in our blog post, we’ll leverage this interoperability to verify validity of OIDC tokens issued to workflows run by GitHub Actions, in that case, the workflow is the workload. GitHub Action’s relevant well known URIs are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/openid-configuration</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/jwks\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/jwks</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proof of concept we’ll be deploying will have the same well known paths, just with a different issuer domain name.</p>\n<p>JWTs are issued with a set of “claims”. When a token is issued with a certain claim, the issuer is asserting that the token lays claim to some value, and by signing the token using its private key, the issuer is making an attestation to the validity of that claim. Therefore, if we trust a given issuer and an OIDC token passes cryptographic signature verification, we know we can trust the claims within that token. The set of claims we’re interested in for our PoC and that our service will issue tokens with are as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"code-label\" title=\"\"></div>\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token property\">&quot;iss&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;https://&lt;deployment-name&gt;.ondigitalocean.app&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token property\">&quot;aud&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;api://DigitalOcean?actx=f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token property\">&quot;sub&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">&quot;actx:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6:role:data-readwrite&quot;</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token property\">&quot;droplet_id&quot;</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">514729608</span>\n\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Token claims</p>\n<p>The issuer here is within the <code>”iss”</code> claim, we append <code>”/.well-known/openid-configuration”</code> to find the OpenID Configuration JSON, decode it, and subsequently find the public JSON Web Keys we can use to perform cryptographic signature verification of the token.</p>\n<p>Also of critical importance to the security of workload identity federation are the audience (<code>”aud”</code>)  and subject (<code>”sub”</code>) claims. The audience is used by the resource server to determine if the token is valid for its resources. Our audience is the API we’re authenticating to (<code>”DigitalOcean”</code>). The subject varies depending on the workload environment we’re authenticating from. The subject identifies the workload itself, what is it?</p>\n<p>In our PoC, setting the subject via Droplet tags is a critical piece of our trust flow. Creation of a Droplet with certain tags in combination with our RBAC roles will define what that Droplet has access to. We’re allowing any team member / role with permission to create a Droplet to set its subject. As such, one must take this into consideration when considering <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/roles/custom/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RBAC definitions and assignments</a>. When we access resources from GitHub Actions, we know the answer to “what is it?” based on how the GitHub Actions orchestrator formats the subject: <code>”org/repo/.github/workflows/name.yml”</code>.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"workload-identity-solution-architecture\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#workload-identity-solution-architecture\">Workload identity solution architecture</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#workload-identity-solution-architecture\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>The goal for our PoC is to allow users to easily provision Droplet access to team resources such as Spaces Keys and Databases, removing the need for out-of-band secret provisioning or hard-coding sensitive values into cloud-init. In our example, we will use GitHub Actions workloads to deploy DigitalOcean Droplets configured with access to a Managed Database and a Spaces bucket without hard-coding any secret token.</p>\n<p>Our PoC has the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An OAuth Client Application following the <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/oauth/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DigitalOcean OAuth Web Application Flow</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A policy-based evaluation to determine access control (supporting policy upload)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provisioning and issuing workload identity tokens</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>.well-known URIs for OIDC token validation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Handlers to intercept and wrap routes provided by the DigitalOcean API:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Droplets/operation/droplets_create\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Create a New Droplet</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Databases/operation/databases_get_cluster\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Retrieve an Existing Database Cluster</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/digitalocean/#tag/Spaces-Keys/operation/spacesKey_create\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Create a New Spaces Access Key</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To tie these aspects together and make them accessible to both our end-users and services such as Droplets and GitHub Actions which will access them, the PoC leverages <a href=\"https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">caddy</a> as a reverse proxy of DigitalOcean’s API. We can then write a Caddyfile configuring caddy to expose the OAuth route to the user, passthroughs of the DigitalOcean API to the user and workloads, and our wrappers around routes we’ll be modifying to enable workload identity.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"image alt text\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/OAuthAppbasedWorkloadIdentityforDropletsBlogPostImages_2025_10_21_07_21/image_2.png\" /><figcaption>Solution High Level Flow</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Caddy enables us to easily define routes we want to handle and routes we want to wrap.

The wrapper creates a provisioning token which is a JWT with the subject containing a nonce value and the audience containing the team UUID associated with the DigitalOcean Personal Access Token sent to the Droplet create call endpoint. The wrapper then injects the provisioning token into the Droplet via modification of the <code>user_data</code> cloud-init field. The modified create request and PAT are then passed through to the upstream API which creates the Droplet.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/OAuthAppbasedWorkloadIdentityforDropletsBlogPostImages_2025_10_21_07_21/image_4_2.png\" /><figcaption>Part 2: Workload Identity Token Provisioning for Droplet</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The application adds the workload identity token to the Droplet after successful completion of signing and validation of a provisioning token done via <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-cloud-config-for-your-initial-server-setup\">cloud-init</a>. On first boot cloud-init executes the <code>user_data</code> which binds the provisioning token to the Droplet by signing it with the Droplet’s SSHD private key.</p>\n<p>The provisioning token and signature are then exchanged for a workload identity token. Our service looks up the Droplet’s IP address using the team OAuth token received from the OAuth flow. It connects to the Droplets listening SSHD port and retrieves its public SSH key to verify the signature over the provisioning token, and upon successful verification it returns the Droplet’s workload identity token for storage and later use on the Droplet. The workload identity token is an OIDC protocol compliant RSA JWT with the subject containing information from the Droplet’s tags as well as the team UUID within the audience. By including the team UUID in the audience we enable mapping workload identity tokens to the team token provided by the initial web OAuth flow.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/OAuthAppbasedWorkloadIdentityforDropletsBlogPostImages_2025_10_21_07_21/image_5.png\" /><figcaption>Workload ID Token Provisioning Flow</figcaption></figure>\n<p>From the Droplet, the workload identity token can be sent to our proxy application where wrappers around Spaces Keys creation and Database information retrieval can lookup the associated OAuth token for the team.</p>\n<p>Before the proxy makes a request to the upstream API, the associated policy referenced by the workload identity token’s subject is used to validate the request data from the workload. The scoped team OAuth token is then used to make the request to the upstream API.</p>\n<p>This approach allows us to effectively act as the DigitalOcean API to properly configured clients, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-default-values\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">doctl</a>. Users set the doctl API URL in their doctl config to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) at which they deployed the API proxy application.</p>\n<p>Any doctl commands will then either be intercepted and wrapped by the proxy logic or passed through unaltered. POST requests to Droplet Create and Spaces Keys Create as well as GET requests to Database endpoints are all intercepted and handled by scripts inside the proxy application which wrap requests and responses with the app’s custom logic. All other requests are passed through to the upstream DigitalOcean API.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/OAuthAppbasedWorkloadIdentityforDropletsBlogPostImages_2025_10_21_07_21/image_6_2.png\" /><figcaption>Part 3: Use of Workload Identity Token by Droplet to Access Resources</figcaption></figure>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#next-steps\">Next steps</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#next-steps\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Now that we’ve reviewed how the <a href=\"https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/droplet-oidc-poc\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">open source Proof of Concept (PoC)</a> works, we’ll deploy the application to DigitalOcean App Platform.

Effective Jan 1, 2026, our billing model will transition to a per-second basis for <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets\">Droplets</a>, with a minimum charge of 60 seconds. This new approach aims to optimize cost control by charging for exact usage over a minute, making it simple to get precise billing for your actual usage. For sustained workloads, the monthly cap of 672 hours (24 hours x 28 days) of usage remains in place, ensuring your bill never exceeds the predictable monthly price.</p>\n<p>Imagine your development team uses a CI/CD pipeline that uses $84/month CPU-Optimized Droplet to run automated tests taking 10 minutes. With hourly billing, each 10-minute task would charge you for the full hour, costing about $0.125. If you ran this job 20 times a day, your daily cost would have been around $2.50, even though the total active time was just over 3 hours. Now, with per-second billing, that same 10-minute task costs only about $0.02. By running the job 20 times a day, your total daily cost is just around $0.42.</p>\n<p>Per-second billing can provide a similarly dramatic cost reduction by ensuring you only pay for the precise compute time you use. Effective Jan 1, 2026, this change will apply automatically to all Droplets. Customers will be able to access detailed usage information, including Droplet start and end times, through their billing history and downloadable CSV reports.</p>\n<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CI/CD pipelines and automated testing:</strong> Only pay for the duration of testing jobs (minimum 60 seconds), not full hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auto-scaled applications:</strong> Instances that briefly scale up will only be billed for active time (minimum 60 seconds), reducing costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Event-driven batch jobs:</strong> Intermittent, event-triggered tasks will be billed precisely for compute time (minimum 60 seconds), avoiding full-hour charges.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Granular cost control:</strong> Pay only for the seconds your Droplets are active, with a 60-second minimum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimized auto-scaling:</strong> Scale up and down to meet demand without incurring full hourly charges for brief usage, with a 60-second minimum per instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Budget predictability:</strong> Retain the monthly cap for continuous workloads.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get ready for this change, effective January 1, 2026: Read <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/details/pricing/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> to learn more and understand your current billing details in the <a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing?i=b1bbf4\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DigitalOcean console</a>.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"new-dedicated-droplet-plans-for-a-seamless-performance-upgrade\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#new-dedicated-droplet-plans-for-a-seamless-performance-upgrade\">New dedicated Droplet plans for a seamless performance upgrade</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#new-dedicated-droplet-plans-for-a-seamless-performance-upgrade\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Historically, upgrading from a shared CPU Droplet to a dedicated CPU Droplet for more consistent, sustained performance meant a large, costly leap in resources.

NAT gateways preview is available for both Droplets and DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS). This enables pods and nodes within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to initiate outbound connections to the public internet using a single, shared public IP address, while keeping the IP addresses of internal resources private.</p>\n<p>Key features include easy setup, multiple NAT gateways per <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/vpc\">VPC</a> for specific Droplet egress, and predictable pricing at $40 per size 1 NAT gateway (including 100 GB bandwidth, $0.01/GB overage), making it significantly cheaper than some market alternatives.

Rest easy developers and database administrators: you’re about to get your peace of mind back. Introducing <strong>Storage autoscaling,</strong> for our entire suite of Managed Databases.</p>\n<p>This new capability for DigitalOcean Managed Databases automatically increases your database’s storage size when needed, so you don’t have to. It’s the automated, proactive safety net that your growing application needs.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works-your-database-but-smarter\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-it-works-your-database-but-smarter\">How it works: your database, but smarter</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-it-works-your-database-but-smarter\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>At its core, Storage autoscaling is about proactive prevention. The way it works is it continuously monitors your database’s disk utilization. When a configurable threshold is exceeded, it automatically scales up your storage in the background. This seamless, automated process helps to ensure that your database remains available without requiring any manual intervention from you. All Managed Database users have access to this new feature, as it is now available for all of our offerings, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka, and OpenSearch.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-storage-autoscaling-helps-you\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-storage-autoscaling-helps-you\">How Storage autoscaling helps you</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-storage-autoscaling-helps-you\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Autoscaling isn’t just a new feature. It’s a better way to manage your growing application. Here’s what this launch means for you:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-improved-performance-and-reliability\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#1-improved-performance-and-reliability\">1. Improved performance and reliability</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#1-improved-performance-and-reliability\"></a></h3>\n<p>This feature is designed to prevent performance degradation and potential outages caused by a database running out of disk space. By automatically adding storage when needed, it helps ensure your application remains responsive, even during unexpected traffic spikes or data growth. All in all, this new feature helps to ensure that your application will stay up and running as its data and needs grow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-reduced-operational-overhead\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#2-reduced-operational-overhead\">2. Reduced operational overhead</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#2-reduced-operational-overhead\"></a></h3>\n<p>Remember those manual checks and late-night alerts about disk space? With autoscaling, those are a thing of the past. Our platform takes care of the critical maintenance task of resizing storage, freeing up your development team to focus on building new features, innovation, and improving your core product, not on database administration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-cost-optimization\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#3-cost-optimization\">3. Cost optimization</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#3-cost-optimization\"></a></h3>\n<p>This feature helps to promote cost-efficiency by letting you provision storage in smaller, automatic increments as you need them. You avoid having to buy and pay for large amounts of unused disk space upfront. This flexibility eliminates the risk of a costly, emergency upgrade to a much larger plan, keeping your storage costs minimized and directly aligned with your actual requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-ability-to-right-size-your-workloads\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#4-ability-to-right-size-your-workloads\">4. Ability to right-size your workloads</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#4-ability-to-right-size-your-workloads\"></a></h3>\n<p>Autoscaling helps to ensure that you always have the right amount of storage, both automatically and in near real time. Instead of overprovisioning “just in case_”_, this feature scales storage up precisely when you need it, monitoring your cluster to match resources to demand. By removing the guesswork, Storage autoscaling helps keep workloads right-sized and performance optimized without manual intervention.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-developers-use-storage-autoscaling\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-developers-use-storage-autoscaling\">How developers use Storage autoscaling</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-developers-use-storage-autoscaling\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>To show you how this feature can make a difference, here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Managing traffic spikes and seasonal surges: For E-commerce companies, Black Friday sales, viral marketing campaigns, or app launches can drive huge bursts of transactions. With autoscaling, your database scales storage in lockstep with demand without manual intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preparing for volatile data such as log and event data growth: Apps that store logs, metrics, or IoT event data can balloon in size during an incident or audit period. Autoscaling means you can preserve all the data you need without scrambling for space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi-tenant growth within a SaaS company: In the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) industry, a single high-activity customer (or a rush of new sign-ups) can push your storage past its limit. Autoscaling makes that growth a non-event from an ops perspective.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Failproofing CI/CD test environments: Automated test runs often generate massive temporary datasets. Autoscaling helps ensure your test pipelines don’t fail mid-run due to full disks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Storage autoscaling provides a simple, yet powerful solution to a common problem. Now you can have confidence that your managed database can seamlessly handle data growth without manual intervention, allowing you to focus on what matters most: building an amazing application.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"get-started\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started\">Get started</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started\"></a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new?activation_redirect=%2Fdatabases%2Fnew&amp;redirect_url=%2Fdatabases%2Fnew?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=autoscaling_for_storage\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spin up a database cluster to access Storage autoscaling</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/release-notes/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read our product documentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=autoscaling_for_storage\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Already have an account?

While it’s not the final release, this milestone gives us a sneak peek into what’s coming next for GitOps practitioners and platform teams.</p><p>This release candidate brings a collection of exciting new features along with critical bug fixes, and in this post, we’ll highlight the most important updates you should be aware of.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please note that Argo CD v2.x will not be supported once the Argo CD v3.2 release is released</p><h3>Health Checks Added for GitOps Promoter</h3><p>This PR introduces comprehensive health checks for GitOps Promoter resources, enabling enhanced monitoring and reliability for promotion workflows within Argo CD.</p><p>The new health checks cover various GitOps Promoter custom resource definitions, such as CommitStatus, PullRequest, PromotionStrategy, and ChangeTransferPolicy, providing detailed runtime status to help users better diagnose and maintain promotion pipelines.</p><p>Shoutout to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a> (Intuit) for this feature!</p><h3>New Deletion Strategy for Progressive Sync</h3><p>With Argo CD v3.2 RC, Progressive Sync now supports configurable deletion strategies for applications deployed by an ApplicationSet. Until now, deletions have always happened all at once, with every application removed in parallel and without any defined order. While this behavior remains the default, a new Reverse option has been introduced. When enabled, applications are deleted in the opposite order of their deployment, as defined in progressiveSync. This ensures that each application is fully removed before proceeding to the next, making it especially useful for workloads that depend on a specific teardown sequence.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’re deploying applications in a specific order using <strong>Progressive Sync</strong>. With the new deletionOrder field, you can now control how those applications are torn down.</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: ApplicationSet<br />metadata:<br />  name: sample-appset<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    type: RollingSync<br />    rollingSync:<br />      steps:<br />        - matchExpressions:<br />            - key: environment<br />              operator: In<br />              values: [ &quot;dev&quot; ]<br />        - matchExpressions:<br />            - key: environment<br />              operator: In<br />              values: [ &quot;staging&quot; ]<br />    deletionOrder: Reverse</pre><p>In this example, applications are deployed first to <em>dev</em> and then to <em>staging</em>. With deletionOrder: Reverse, Argo CD will delete <em>staging</em> before <em>dev</em>, ensuring a clean and safe teardown sequence that respects dependency order. Without this setting (the default AllAtOnce), both environments would be deleted in parallel, which can cause problems if one depends on the other.</p><p>Shoutout to <a href=\"https://github.com/ranakan19\">Kanika Rana</a> (Red Hat) for this feature!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements:</h3><p>There have been a bunch of hydrator improvements in this release, out of which some have been listed below</p><ul><li>Add the ability to template the commit message for source hydrator (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pbhatnagar-oss\">@pbhatnagar-oss</a>)</li><li>Provide template support for writing credentials for hydrator (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pbhatnagar-oss\">@pbhatnagar-oss</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/24129\">Preserve non-hydrated files during hydration</a> (by <a href=\"http://github.com/nitishfy\">Nitish Kumar</a> (Akuity))</li><li>Parallelize repo server calls to generate manifests for a group of apps destined for the same target branch (by <a href=\"http://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a> (Intuit))</li><li>And many more…..</li></ul><p>It is recommended to go through the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.2.0-rc1\">release notes</a> to gather more information about hydrator improvements.</p><h3>Adding a Title matching filter for Pull Request Generator</h3><p>Argo CD v3.2 now comes with added <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23569\">title matching support</a> to the Pull Request Generator in Argo CD’s ApplicationSet, providing a new way to filter and select pull requests based on the PR title, not just the branch name. This enhancement enables users to define filters using the pull request title string, improving flexibility for workflows where PR titles convey important context or naming patterns, such as release types, ticket numbers, or automated upgrade bots</p><p>Shoutout to <a href=\"https://github.com/nitishfy\">Nitish Kumar</a> (Akuity) for this feature!</p><h3>Server-Side Diff Support in Argo CD CLI</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23978\">This PR</a> brings powerful new capabilities to the Argo CD CLI by adding support for server-side diff calculations. With the new — server-side-diff flag, users can now perform diff operations using the Kubernetes API server’s dry-run apply, resulting in more accurate and realistic comparisons that reflect the true behavior of resource application as seen by the cluster.</p><p>The enhancement integrates with both client-side and server-side manifest generation, offers robust handling of custom resource types, and ensures consistent output for advanced workflows such as previewing changes from local manifests before applying them.</p><p>Shoutout to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">Peter Jiang (Intuit)</a> for this feature!</p><h3>Other Notable Changes:</h3><p>Here are some other new changes that made it into the release</p><ul><li>Implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/24017\">Altinity clickhouse-operator CRD health checks</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/acze\">Szymon Kośla</a>)</li><li>Ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/24356\">pass authenticated user ID as headers to extensions</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a> from Intuit)</li><li>Get the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23536\">commit server URL from the environment variable</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/nobbs\">Alexej Disterhoft</a> from Redcare Pharmacy N.V. — Data)</li><li>Improved <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23669\">developer guide for Argo CD</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> from Octopus Deploy)</li><li>Fix the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23565\">hydrator issue about repo URL normalization</a> if two apps have different repo URL formats (by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a> from Intuit)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/24536\">Expose `ARGOCD_SYNC_WAVE_DELAY` env as configurable parameter</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/u-kai\">Kai Udo</a>)</li><li>and many more……</li></ul><h3>Where can I get the new Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.2.0-rc1\">release notes</a> and <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

      "summary": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_-6V9xGQM6vGmsiD_dNEog.png\" /></figure><p>The results of the 2025 Argo CD user survey are in! We had a fantastic response, with 185 submissions, which shows the community is more engaged than ever.</p><p>This year, our goal was to capture a well-rounded view of how folks use Argo CD. We strive to stay closely connected to our users, understand where we’re excelling, and identify current pain points so we can prioritize improvements and proactively address community needs.</p><p>This year’s theme is environment promotion, as it has emerged as one of the most significant pain points currently experienced by Argo CD users.</p><p>Here’s what we learned.</p><h4>TL;DR</h4><p>Argo CD is growing fast and becoming a standard for deployments to production!</p><p>Compared to 2023, significantly more organizations rely on it in production. Over 60% of respondents have been actively using it in Production for more than 2 years. Patterns like ApplicationSets and self-healing have become widely adopted. Argo CD is increasingly being used at scale, with instances managing more applications, often spanning multiple clusters. We can expect scalability and performance to become the pressure points, as well as growing interest in enterprise-like capabilities from the community.</p><p>Environment promotion is where things start to get tricky. Most teams still lean on custom scripts or manual steps to get the job done. Many organizations seek solutions to improve traceability and visibility, and to standardize workflows across environments. We will likely see more maturity and new capabilities in this area.</p><p>We’re also seeing more applications under management overall, with organizations connecting more clusters to each Argo CD instance, yet still running just one to five instances. This trend points to growing pressure on instance scalability and performance.</p><p>A few more highlights from the results:</p><ul><li>Argo Labs projects like Argo CD Image Updater, Argo CD Operator, and Argo CD Vault Plugin are gaining traction, reflecting a push toward automation.</li><li>Helm is by far the most popular Argo CD installation method.</li><li>Platform engineers now make up a larger share of the community, reflecting broader organizational shifts.</li></ul><h4>What do developers really think of Argo CD?</h4><p>We kicked off the survey by asking users how likely they were to recommend Argo CD to others — one of the simplest ways to get a feel for overall satisfaction.</p><p>The 2025 result? Overwhelmingly positive 🎉 Even more users this year said they’d recommend Argo CD compared to an already strong showing in 2023. That shift says a lot about how far the tool has come and the growing trust the community has in it. In fact, Argo CD achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 79 — an increase of 3 points from two years ago — highlighting exceptional user satisfaction!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZY4tGNGXZGrHgLfn\" /></figure><p>We were overwhelmed by the encouraging and positive comments, reflecting just how much people love the project and deeply value the vibrant Argo community. Here’s what some users had to say:</p><blockquote><em>“Argo CD is incredible, I have no idea how we survived without it in the past.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Thanks for this great tool ❤️”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re awesome!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Please keep going!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Keep up the good work! :)”</em></blockquote><p>We asked which features users find most valuable. The winners?</p><ul><li>ApplicationSets</li><li>Argo CD’s intuitive UI</li></ul><p>Together, they make it much easier to manage and visualise complex deployments.</p><p>Also mentioned: auto-sync, drift detection, rollbacks, RBAC, multi-source support, and integrations.</p><h4>Who’s using Argo CD these days?</h4><p>The community remains consistent and is made up mostly of DevOps and platform engineers, but platform engineers have grown from 25% in 2023 to 37% in 2025. DevOps engineers declined slightly from 43% to 36%. This shift likely reflects the broader industry trend toward adopting a platform mindset, resulting in increased demand for dedicated platform engineering roles. Roles like architects and SREs remained steady.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZXUJ5osL9R28zoUn\" /></figure><h4>What does adoption look like in 2025?</h4><p>With the adoption being consistently high, 93% of respondents use Argo CD in production in 2023 and 97% in 2025, the implementation maturity grows significantly. In 2023, only 28% had used Argo CD in production for over 2 years. In 2025, that number jumped to 60%, and fewer than 10% were still evaluating or in early phases.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e0xsvHzotjrhkIYg\" /></figure><p>Almost 60% of respondents said that 75% or more of their production applications now run on Kubernetes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gWqJBdpN4BHjbFFs\" /></figure><p>As Kubernetes adoption deepens, Argo CD has become an essential part of the CI/CD infrastructure. As more organizations rely on Argo CD, we’ll likely see continued investment from both the community and vendors, as well as more contributors joining the project.</p><p>When it comes to Argo CD installation, Helm is by far the top choice, followed by tools like Kustomize and Terraform. Interesting to note: 19% use cluster-wide installs versus just 10% using namespace-scoped ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x4RJRiUclqZg-VgN\" /></figure><h4>What does the Argo CD footprint look like?</h4><p>The most noticeable trend is the growing number of applications. Organizations are managing bigger setups with fewer, larger instances.</p><p>In 2023, just over 15% managed more than 500 Applications; by 2025, this rose to 42%. Notably, these numbers don’t correlate with how long organizations have used Argo CD and how many applications they have.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eRwUqAp_3dbairfo\" /></figure><p>The number of Argo CD instances is growing compared to 2023, but the increase is not as significant as the rise in the number of applications. In 2023, 77% of respondents reported having fewer than 6 instances, while this percentage fell to 64% in 2025. Nevertheless, most organizations still use only a handful of instances.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q_ePbizmF7pE04-k\" /></figure><p>Even though the number of Argo CD instances hasn’t changed much, the number of applications certainly has! This means each instance is likely connecting to more clusters. For example, back in 2023, about 42% of instances were linked to one Kubernetes cluster. Fast forward to 2025, and that number has dropped to 25%. At the same time, the share of instances connecting to more than 20 clusters has jumped significantly, going from 5% to 25%.</p><p>In summary, organizations manage a significantly larger number of applications, with more clusters connected to a single Argo CD instance, typically keeping the number of instances between 1 and 5.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the community and the project? Well, it seems that managing lots of Argo CD instances might not be the biggest hurdle for most teams. Instead, the real pressure points are around scalability and performance as organizations push Argo CD to handle more clusters and Applications. Users are already calling out these challenges, and they’re likely to become even more important moving forward. The good news? Some of this work is already underway.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Interested in how to scale Argo CD? Take a look at the </em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-agent\"><em>argocd-agent project</em></a><em> or read an </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\"><em>article about scaling up Argo CD</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to contribute to measuring and improving Argo scalability, take a look at the Scalability special interest group (</em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/main/sigs/sig-scalability\"><em>Argo SIG Scalability</em></a><em>).</em></p><h4>What patterns and tools are catching on?</h4><p>More and more teams are following Argo CD’s recommended practices. App-of-Apps, ApplicationSets, and built-in self-healing are now widely used to manage complex GitOps setups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG5_7BB_xx5xn1U_\" /></figure><p>We also asked about sub-projects, an area that shows the ecosystem dynamics. The most used are:</p><ul><li>Argo CD Image Updater</li><li>Argo CD Operator</li><li>Argo CD Vault Plugin</li></ul><p>Like the patterns mentioned earlier, the popularity of these Argo Labs projects reflects growing efforts to make Argo CD implementations more structured and automation-friendly.</p><p><em>ℹ️ You can manage secrets with </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/secret-management/#secret-management\"><em>Kubernetes operators</em></a><em>, one of the recommended ways of managing secrets on the destination cluster. This keeps Argo CD out of direct secret management, helping avoid accidental updates and reducing the risk of leaks.</em></p><p>Image Updater is the most adopted sub-project (used by 34% of respondents). While still under active development and intended for non-critical environments, its popularity shows just how hungry teams are for better deployment and promotion automation.</p><p>But Image Updater only solves part of the deployment automation puzzle. There’s still no go-to comprehensive solution out there. We’ll explore this further in the next section on environment promotion.</p><h4>Environment promotion</h4><p>Given how widely Argo CD is used in production, we wanted to explore how teams handle environment promotion. Is it a pain point for GitOps users? And how do their approaches compare to the more traditional promotion strategies used on other platforms?</p><p>First, we looked at the number of environments teams work with. Now, most respondents use 3 or fewer. Only 12% reported having more than 8.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lwhiMHHc0r41nELe\" /></figure><p>This introduces complexity, as teams must coordinate across multiple instances. And that’s where challenges like consistent observability start to show up.</p><p>To dig deeper into this, we asked teams about their biggest pain points. What came up most?</p><ul><li>Traceability across environments, what version of a deployed app is running where (51%)</li><li>Release gates (44%)</li><li>Understanding app health and status across environments (37%)</li><li>Keeping pipeline definitions consistent (36%)</li><li>Troubleshooting failed promotions (29%)</li></ul><p>Most teams reported multiple challenges, with traceability and release gates often mentioned together.</p><p>To understand what drives these challenges, we asked how teams promote applications across environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IV4zO6ktxeE6AFz0\" /></figure><p>The most common setup is DIY. Around 67% use scripts, in-house tools, or both.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of teams handle promotions solely through manual manifest updates, and almost half use some form of manual step, often paired with scripts.</p><p>So, how can we make sense of this combination? One possibility is that teams are using Argo CD Image Updater, currently the most popular sub-project, for simple, image-only updates. For more complex tasks, like updating configuration files, many might rely on manual steps. In other words, automation helps with the easy stuff, but more involved changes still need hands-on work.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Manual manifest updates are often where teams start with Argo CD. They can work well for small setups, like a few static infrastructure manifests.</em></p><p><em>But as you scale, they tend to fall short. It’s easy to run into slower deployments, more manual overhead, and challenges around security and compliance. If you’re growing with Argo CD, it’s worth moving toward full CI/CD automation to keep things on track.</em></p><p>A few out-of-the-box solutions for automated environment promotion are starting to show up in the survey. The most mentioned, though still only used by 4% of respondents, is <a href=\"https://argo-gitops-promoter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">GitOps Promoter</a>. It’s part of the Argo CD ecosystem and works alongside <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/proposals/manifest-hydrator/\">Hydrator</a> to handle promotions via pull requests. Others mentioned Codefresh GitOps and Kargo.</p><p>Here’s how one person summed it up:</p><blockquote><em>“Some sort of environment promotion. Lots of players in the game now and it’s hard to settle on one. Lots of manual reviews required for manifest changes that can be tiresome to compare against other environments. Some sort of environment comparison tool would be good.”</em></blockquote><p>That quote really captures where things stand. Plenty is happening in this space, but no clear winner or standard approach just yet. As more teams adopt Argo CD and take on more advanced deployment setups, tackling challenges like traceability, testing, and consistent configuration will only become more important.</p><p>This is definitely a space to watch. Expect more tooling, more investment, and, hopefully, comprehensive user-friendly solutions soon.</p><h4>What challenges are teams facing?</h4><p>After digging into environment promotion, we zoomed out and asked about broader challenges, too.</p><p>Nearly 30% of respondents said they had no major challenges with Argo CD, which is a great sign.</p><p>The most common challenge, flagged by 37%, was environment modeling and promotion workflows (covered earlier).</p><p>Other pain points included:</p><ul><li>Troubleshooting deployments and app issues (25%)</li><li>Too much manual work or not enough automation (23%)</li><li>Limited visibility into deployment status (16%)</li></ul><h4>What features are missing?</h4><p>To wrap up, we asked what users think is missing from Argo CD. Many of the responses built on earlier themes.</p><p>Some areas users want to see improved:</p><ul><li>Support for promoting apps through stages and managing service dependencies.</li><li>Better templating in ApplicationSets, progressive syncs, and built-in promotion workflows.</li><li>Multi-cluster visibility and faster UI performance.</li><li>Enterprise-grade features like fine-grained RBAC, audit trails, Vault and Prometheus integrations, and better error messages.</li></ul><p>As teams scale up, these requests point toward a natural next step: evolving Argo CD into a full-featured, enterprise-ready platform.</p><h4>Final words</h4><p>The 2025 survey gave us a ton to think about. We saw just how far Argo CD has come, what’s working well, and what needs more attention. All these insights are gold for the project’s future evolution.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to share feedback!</p><p>Special shoutout to those who offered to help with case studies, blog posts, talks, or quotes.

With v3.1, the first batch of features comes out of the gate; featuring <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">OCI</a> support, CLI Plugins, Hydrator updates, UI improvements, plus much more.</p><p>Along with new features, this release comes with a whole slew of security fixes, bug fixes, and general quality of life improvements.</p><p>You can download the v3.1 on the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">Argo CD Releases Page</a>!</p><p>We are really excited to have you try out the new features and look forward to any feedback from the border community! With that, let’s dive into what this release holds!</p><h3>OCI Support</h3><p>Argo CD has supported obtaining Kubernetes manifests from either a Git repository, a Helm chart repository, and later support for getting manifests from a Helm chart stored within an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry. As OCI registries have more frequently been used to store content aside from container images, more and more projects have been adding support for using OCI as a storage mechanism and a source of truth.</p><p>Starting with Argo CD v3.1, we now support OCI by enabling the use of OCI-compliant container registries as sources for configuration artifacts. This means Argo CD can pull Kubernetes manifests packaged as OCI artifacts from registries that follow the OCI image and distribution specifications. This enhances security and portability, as it allows users to leverage the same registries they use for container images to also store and distribute deployment configurations. Argo CD OCI support comes into beta with this release.</p><p>BIG thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">@blakepettersson</a> from Akuity for leading this effort!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements</h3><p>Manifest changes are often just image tag bumps. For example, the manifest change associated with a code change. The manifest hydrator writes metadata to the hydrated branch to associate the hydrated commit back to its corresponding dry commit.</p><p>Starting in v3.1, the Hydrator now allows for a way to associate a dry commit with a code commit. This is done by adding information about the upstream repo url, that commit SHA hash, the author of that commit, and any messages associated with that code commit. This information is then added to the Hydrator manifest metadata; this enables future work to be able to display this metadata in the Argo CD UI.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a> from Intuit for this improvement.</p><h3>Server-Side Apply Stabilization</h3><p>Argo CD now supports client-side apply migration, which helps transitioning from client-side apply to server-side apply by moving a resource’s managed fields from one manager to Argo CD’s manager. This feature is particularly useful when you need to migrate existing resources that were created using kubectl client-side apply to server-side apply with Argo CD. You can also specify your own field manager to migrate from using an annotation. This is useful when you have other operators managing resources that are no longer in use and would like Argo CD to own all the fields for that operator.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">@pjiang-dev</a> from Intuit for this contribution.</p><h3>UI Parameterized Action</h3><p>The Argo CD UI in many ways is the first Kubernetes dashboard, providing not only a UI for GitOps users; but also a feature rich UI for Kubernetes end users. In this release, we’ve added the ability to perform additional action on Kubernetes resources, beyond just deleting.</p><p>This feature enables users to scale resources directly from the Argo CD UI. Users will be able to increase or decrease the number of replicas (Pods) for Deployments and StatefulSets by using an input field.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/10551\">#10551</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">@rumstead</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/#default-resourceexclusions-configurations\">Ignore differences on high churn controller managed resources</a> like those from Cert Manager, Kyverno, Cilium, and Kubernetes.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>. Since we <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/announcing-argo-cd-v3-small-but-mighty-df05c0b39ad6\">announced Argo CD 3.0</a> many <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/help-us-shape-the-future-of-argo-cd-3-0-ebc670413312\">have offered feedback, contributions, and ideas</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*49UiTK-B6pgcG9ZfTjqYew.png\" /><figcaption>More than 94 contributors for Argo CD 3.0</figcaption></figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a0b933f4e58f\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-cd-v3-0-release-candidate-a0b933f4e58f\">Argo CD v3.0 Release Candidate</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months.

The main use case for this is to allow users to wait on a condition (in a step analysis especially) to hold, before proceeding to the next step.</p><p>Here is an example analysis:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: AnalysisTemplate<br />metadata:<br />  name: success-rate<br />spec:<br />  args:<br />  - name: service-name<br />  metrics:<br />  - name: success-rate<br />    interval: 1m<br />    successCondition: result[0] &lt;= 0.95<br />    consecutiveSuccessLimit: 3<br />    provider:<br />      prometheus:<br />        address: http://prometheus.example.com:9090<br />        query: |<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;,response_code!~&quot;5.*&quot;}[1m]<br />          )) /<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;}[1m]<br />          ))</pre><p>You can find more information in the documentation found <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/analysis/#consecutivesuccesslimit-and-failurelimit\">here</a> .</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/y-rabie\">Youssef Rabie</a></p><h3>Other Features</h3><ul><li>New Prometheus metric: build_info (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3591\">#3591</a>)</li><li>Enable pprof profiling support (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3769\">#3769</a>)</li><li>Allow specifying full annotations for Nginx canary (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3671\">#3671</a>)</li><li>Credentials to download plugin (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3905\">#3905</a>)</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><p>We had 36 labeled bug fixes in this release some of the area’s of focus for bugs have been around Rollouts getting stuck progressing and better verification of not causing any outage during a rollout. So, if you have experienced any of these issue test this release out and let us know how it behaves.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>This releases big feature was around step plugins, I can’t wait to see what this feature empowers end users to create. Feel free to share in the CNCF Argo Rollouts Slack channel and open an issue if you would like a plugin repo on argoproj-labs.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

      "summary": "<h3><strong>Argo CD v2.14</strong></h3><p>We are thrilled to announce the release of Argo CD 2.14, packed with new features, bug fixes, and documentation updates to enhance your experience.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in Argo CD 2.14. As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

to require both namespace and service accounts to match (previously only the namespace), or to have an explicit <code>ReferenceGrant</code>, for Kubernetes Gateway API gateways. Gateways that use a hostname address remain namespace-only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a goroutine leak in multicluster where <code>krt</code> collections with data from remote clusters would stay in memory even after that cluster was removed.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57269\">Issue #57269</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the behavior of istio-cni cleanup when the <code>get daemonset</code> command fails with an error other than &ldquo;not found&rdquo;. It now defaults to not cleaning up the CNI config and binary when it cannot be determined whether an upgrade, deletion, or node reboot is in progress. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57316\">Issue #57316</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the cluster waypoint <code>correct_originate</code> configuration when <code>PILOT_SKIP_VALIDATE_TRUST_DOMAIN</code> is set.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56741\">Issue #56741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an annotation issue where both <code>istio.io/reroute-virtual-interfaces</code> and the deprecated <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/kubevirtInterfaces</code> were processed. The newer <code>reroute-virtual-interfaces</code> annotation now correctly takes precedence.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57662\">Issue #57662</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> <code>ServiceEntry</code> resolution in ztunnel to match port names to pod container ports, aligning behavior with sidecars, when there isn&rsquo;t an explicit <code>targetPort</code> set.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57713\">Issue #57713</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> missing gateway reconciliation for MeshConfig changes. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57890\">Issue #57890</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> the istioctl installation dependency between pilot and CNI. CNI installation is no longer dependent on pilot being installed first. If the istio-cni configuration exists before installation (which can be the case when using an istio-owned CNI config), pilot installation will not fail while waiting for CNI readiness since CNI installation is no longer dependent on pilot.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57600\">Issue #57600</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

<p>Inspect the full set of source code changes.</p>\n        </a>\n    \n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"changes\">Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> access to referenced TLS secrets to require both namespace and service accounts to match (previously only the namespace), or to have an explicit <code>ReferenceGrant</code>, for Kubernetes Gateway API gateways. Gateways that use a hostname address remain namespace-only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to turn off associating pods to proxies by IP address if association by name and namespace fails.\nThis is on by default, matching the old behavior, and can be disabled with <code>ENABLE_PROXY_FIND_POD_BY_IP=off</code>.\nFuture versions have this off by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the cluster waypoint <code>correct_originate</code> configuration when <code>PILOT_SKIP_VALIDATE_TRUST_DOMAIN</code> is set. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56741\">Issue #56741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an annotation issue where both <code>istio.io/reroute-virtual-interfaces</code> and the deprecated <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/kubevirtInterfaces</code> were processed. The newer <code>reroute-virtual-interfaces</code> annotation now correctly takes precedence. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57662\">Issue #57662</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> <code>ServiceEntry</code> resolution in ztunnel to match port names to pod container ports, aligning behavior with sidecars, when there isn&rsquo;t an explicit <code>targetPort</code> set.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57713\">Issue #57713</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> missing gateway reconciliation for MeshConfig changes. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57890\">Issue #57890</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> the istioctl installation dependency between pilot and CNI. CNI installation is no longer dependent on pilot being installed first. If the istio-cni configuration exists before installation (which can be the case when using an istio-owned CNI config), pilot installation will not fail while waiting for CNI readiness since CNI installation is no longer dependent on pilot. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57600\">Issue #57600</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

I went on to make meaningful contributions to the project, and I've learned that what I\nexperienced is nearly universal among non-technical contributors to open source.</p>\n<p>If you're feeling that same uncertainty, this post is for you. I'll share the challenges you're likely to face (or already face),\nwhy your contributions matter, and how to find your place in the Prometheus community.</p>\n<h2>The Challenges Non-Technical Contributors Face</h2>\n<p>As a non-technical contributor, I've had my share of obstacles in open source. And from conversations with others navigating these spaces,\nI've found the struggles are remarkably consistent. Here are the most common barriers:</p>\n<h3>1. The Technical Intimidation Factor</h3>\n<p>I've felt out of place in open source spaces, mostly because technical contributors vastly outnumber non-technical ones. Even the non-technical\npeople often have technical backgrounds or have been around long enough to understand what's happening.</p>\n<p>When every conversation references concepts you don't know, it's easy to feel intimidated. You join meetings and stay silent throughout.\nYou respond in the chat instead of unmuting because you don't trust yourself to speak up in a recorded meeting where everyone else seems\nfluent in a technical language you're still learning.</p>\n<h3>2. Unclear Value Proposition</h3>\n<p>Open source projects rarely spell out their non-technical needs the way a job posting would. You would hardly find an issue titled\n\"Need: someone to interview users and write case studies\" or \"Wanted: community manager to organize monthly meetups.\" Instead, you’re\nmore likely to see a backlog of GitHub issues about bugs, feature requests, and code refactoring.</p>\n<p>Even if you have valuable skills, you don't know where they're needed, how to articulate your value, or whether your contributions will\nbe seen as mission-critical or just nice-to-have. Without a clear sense of how you fit in, it's difficult to reach out confidently.\nYou end up sending vague messages like \"I'd love to help! Let me know if there's anything I can do\", which rarely leads anywhere because\nmaintainers are busy and don't have time to figure out how to match your skills to their needs.</p>\n<h3>3. Lack of Visible Non-Technical Contributors</h3>\n<p>One of the things that draws me to an open source community or project is finding other people like me. I think it's the same way for most people.\nRepresentation matters. It's hard to be what you can't see.</p>\n<p>It’s even more difficult to find non-technical contributors because their contributions are often invisible in the ways projects typically showcase work.\nGitHub contribution graphs count commits. Changelogs list code changes and bug fixes. You only get the \"contributor\" label when you've created a\npull request that got merged. So, even when people are organizing events, supporting users, or conducting research, their work doesn't show up in\nthe same prominent ways code does.</p>\n<h3>4. The Onboarding Gap</h3>\n<p>A typical \"Contributing Guide\" will walk you through setting up a development environment, creating a branch, running tests, and submitting a pull request.\nBut it rarely explains how to contribute documentation improvements, where design feedback should go, or how community support is organized.</p>\n<p>You see \"Join our community\" with a link to a Slack workspace. But between joining and making your first contribution, there's a significant gap.\nThere are hundreds of people in dozens of channels. Who's a maintainer and who's just another community member? Which channel is appropriate for\nyour questions? Who should you tag when you need guidance?</p>\n<h2>Why These Gaps Exist</h2>\n<p>It's worth acknowledging that most of the time, these gaps aren't intentional. Projects don't set out to exclude non-technical contributors or\nmake it harder for them to participate.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a small group of developers build something useful and decide to open-source it. They invite people they know who might need it\n(often other developers) to contribute. The project grows organically within those networks. It becomes a community of developers building\ntools for developers, and certain functions simply don't feel necessary yet. Marketing? The word spreads naturally through tech circles.\nCommunity management? The community is small and self-organizing. UX design? They're developers comfortable with command-line interfaces,\nso they may not fully consider the experience of using a graphical interface.</p>\n<p>None of this is malicious. It's just that the project evolved in a context where those skills weren't obviously needed.</p>\n<p>The shift happens when someone, often a non-technical contributor who sees the potential, steps in and says:\n\"You've built something valuable and grown an impressive community. But here's what you might be missing.\nHere's how documentation could lower the barrier to entry. Here's how community management could retain contributors.\nHere's how user research could guide your roadmap.\"</p>\n<h2>Why Non-Technical Contributions Matter</h2>\n<p>Prometheus is a powerful monitoring system backed by a large community of developers. But like any open source project, it needs more than code to thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs accessible documentation.</strong> From my experience working with engineers, most would rather focus on building than writing docs,\nand understandably so. Engineers who know the system inside out often write documentation that assumes knowledge newcomers don't have.\nWhat makes perfect sense to someone who built the feature can feel impenetrable to someone encountering it for the first time.\nA technical writer testing the product from an end user's perspective, not a builder's, can bridge that gap and lower the barrier to entry.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs organization.</strong> The GitHub issues backlog has hundreds of open items that haven't been triaged. Maintainers spend valuable\ntime parsing what users actually need instead of building solutions. A project manager or someone with triage experience could turn\nthat chaos into a clear roadmap, allowing maintainers to spend their time building solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs community support.</strong> Imagine a user who joins the Slack workspace, excited to contribute. They don't know where to start.\nThey ask a question that gets buried in the stream of messages. They quietly leave. The project just lost a potential contributor because\nno one was there to welcome them and point them in the right direction.</p>\n<p>These are the situations non-technical contributions can help prevent. Good documentation lowers the barrier to entry, which means more adoption,\nmore feedback, and better features. Active community management retains contributors who would otherwise drift away, which means distributed\nknowledge and less maintainer burnout. Organization and triage turn scattered input into actionable priorities.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus maintainers are doing exceptional work building a robust, scalable monitoring system. But they can't do everything,\nand they shouldn't have to. The question now isn't whether non-technical contributions matter. It's whether we create the space for them to happen.</p>\n<h2>Practical Ways You Can Contribute to Prometheus</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus but aren't sure where to start, here are some areas where non-technical skills are actively needed.</p>\n<h3>1. Join the UX Efforts</h3>\n<p>Prometheus is actively working to improve its user experience, and the community now has a\n<a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C09NL3B1EKW\">UX Working Group</a> dedicated to this effort.</p>\n<p>If you're a UX researcher, designer, or someone with an eye for usability, this is an excellent time to get involved.\nThe working group is still taking shape, with ongoing discussions about priorities and processes.\nJoin the Slack channel to participate in these conversations and watch for upcoming announcements about specific ways to contribute.</p>\n<p>I can tell you from experience that the community is receptive to UX contributions, and your work will have a real impact.</p>\n<h3>2. Write for the Prometheus Blog</h3>\n<p>If you're a technical writer or content creator, the Prometheus blog is a natural entry point. The blog publishes tutorials,\ncase studies, best practices, community updates, and generally, content that helps users get more value from Prometheus.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/README.md\">blog content guide</a> to understand what makes a strong blog proposal and how to publish a post on the blog.\nThere's an audience eager to learn from your experience.</p>\n<h3>3. Improve and Maintain Documentation</h3>\n<p>Documentation is one of those perpetual needs in open source. There's always something that could be clearer, more complete, or better organized.\nThe Prometheus docs repo is no exception.</p>\n<p>You can contribute by fixing typos and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/issues/2649\">broken links</a>, expanding getting-started guides,\ncreating tutorials for common monitoring scenarios, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSUa5y7Ji0&#x26;t=27105s\">triaging issues</a> to help\nprioritize what needs attention. Even if you don't consider yourself a technical writer, if you've ever been confused by the docs and\nfigured something out, you can help make it clearer for the next person.</p>\n<h3>4. Help Organize PromCon</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://promcon.io/\">PromCon</a> is Prometheus's annual conference, and it takes significant coordination to pull off.\nThe organizing team handles everything from speaker selection and scheduling to venue logistics and sponsor relationships.</p>\n<p>If you have experience in event planning, sponsor outreach, marketing, or communications, the PromCon organizers would welcome your help.\nReach out to the <a href=\"mailto:promcon-organizers@googlegroups.com\">organizing team</a> or watch for announcements in the Prometheus community channels.</p>\n<h3>5. Advocate and Amplify</h3>\n<p>Finally, one of the simplest but most impactful things you can do is talk about Prometheus. Write blog posts about how you're using Prometheus.\nGive talks at local meetups or conferences. Share tips and learnings on social media. Create video tutorials or live streams.\nRecommend Prometheus to teams evaluating monitoring solutions.</p>\n<p>Every piece of content, every conference talk, every social media post expands Prometheus's reach and helps new users discover it.</p>\n<h2>How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus, here's what I've learned from my own experience navigating the community as a non-technical contributor:</p>\n<p><strong>Start by introducing yourself.</strong> When you join the #prometheus-dev Slack channel, say hello. Slack doesn't always make it obvious\nwhen someone new joins, so if you stay silent, people simply won't know you're there. A simple introduction—your name, what you do, what brought you to Prometheus—is enough to make your presence known.</p>\n<p><strong>Attend community meetings.</strong> Check out the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/#calendar-for-public-events\">community calendar</a> and\nsync the meetings that interest you. Even if you don't understand everything being discussed at first (and that's completely normal), stay.\nThe more you sit in, the more you'll learn about the community's needs and find more opportunities to contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Observe before you act.</strong> It's tempting to jump in with ideas immediately, but spending time as an observer first pays off.\nRead through Slack discussions and conversations in GitHub issues. Browse the documentation. Notice what kinds of contributions are being made.\nYou'll start to see patterns: recurring questions, documentation gaps, areas where help is needed. That's where your opportunity lies.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Everyone was new once. If something isn't clear, ask. If you don't get a response right away,\ngive it some time—people are busy—then follow up. The community is welcoming, but you have to make yourself visible.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus community has room for you. Now you know exactly where to begin.</p>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

We need everyone in the community to try them out and report any issues you might find.\nThe more feedback we get, the more stable the final 3.0 release can be.</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-09-11/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view, and will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.\nSince the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars, created timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. More details can be found <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus intends to be the default choice for storing OpenTelemetry metrics, and 3.0 includes some big new features that makes it even better as a storage backend for OpenTelemetry metrics data.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8</h4>\n<p>By default, Prometheus will allow all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names, as well as label values as has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8, metric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>. In the spirit of End User confidence, we decided to track their results while they position themselves as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.</p>\n<h3>aaS</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronosphere</li>\n<li>Grafana Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>New Relic</li>\n<li>Sysdig Monitor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: As Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on Cortex just like Grafana Cloud, we expect them to pass after the next update cycle.</p>\n<h2>Agent/Collector</h2>\n<h3>Passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafana Agent 0.19.0</li>\n<li>OpenTelemetry Collector 0.37.0</li>\n<li>Prometheus 2.30.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Telegraf 1.20.2</li>\n<li>Timber Vector 0.16.1</li>\n<li>VictoriaMetrics Agent 1.67.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: We tested Vector 0.16.1 instead of 0.17.0 because there are no binary downloads for 0.17.0 and our test toolchain currently expects binaries.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>It has been more than half a year since our last official kube-router release, so I think we're more than past time to do so. Additionally, there have been quite a few items that have been fixed or upgraded.</p>\n<h3>Highlights &amp; Changed Functionality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Network Services Controller (enabled via <code>--run-service-proxy</code>) now fetches metrics when the metrics URL is hit rather than on the sync period (<code>--ipvs-sync-period</code>). This allows for more fine-grained and up-to-date metrics on IPVS services. (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rkojedzinszky\">@rkojedzinszky</a>!)</li>\n<li>Service's <code>externalIP</code> and <code>LoadBalancerIP</code> are now labels on IPVS metrics which can increase cardinality, but also provides better visibility for services. Prior to this, only the <code>ClusterIP</code> or <code>NodePort</code> labels were added to metrics.</li>\n<li>The GoBGP port can be changed or disabled via <code>--gpbgp-admin-port</code> to create more secure / flexible deployments of kube-router</li>\n<li>We converted a lot of exec's  out to <code>iproute2</code> into <code>netlink</code> library calls, making the code more idiomatic, faster, and less fragile to userspace tooling changes</li>\n<li>When both DSR and Maglev is enabled on a service kube-router will automatically enable the kernel option <code>sloppy_tcp</code> for IPVS which allows for greater service routing consistency when transitioning nodes (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/AnupamGhosh\">@AnupamGhosh</a>!)</li>\n<li>All references to Endpoints has been removed since the API is now fully deprecated and EndpointSlices is now used behind the scenes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1895\">1895</a> - IPv6 NDP NA/NS dropped when using egress network policy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1875\">1875</a> - Collect service statistics real-time</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1860\">1888</a> -

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -
