      "summary": "<p>In this SIG etcd spotlight we talked with <a href=\"https://github.com/jmhbnz\">James Blair</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serathius\">Marek\nSiarkowicz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/wenjiaswe\">Wenjia Zhang</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ahrtr\">Benjamin Wang</a> to learn a bit more about this Kubernetes Special Interest\nGroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-sig-etcd\">Introducing SIG etcd</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Hello, thank you for the time! Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a\nbit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin:</strong> Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I\nwork for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes &amp; etcd &amp; CSI\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md\">Container Storage Interface</a>)\nbecause of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes &amp; etcd\n(and also CSI) since 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>James:</strong> Hey team, I’m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a\nSpecialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the\nKubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project\nneeded help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that\n&quot;you come for the technology, and stay for the people&quot;: for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a\nwonderful journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Marek:</strong> Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring\na stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG\nInstrumentation</a>, where I\ncreated and led the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/\">Kubernetes Structured Logging effort</a>.<br />\nI'm still the main project lead for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/\">Kubernetes Metrics Server</a>,\nproviding crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,\nright around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most\nscalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's\nhistory. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia:</strong> Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd\nmaintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)\nand GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and\netcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my\njob, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more\nimportantly, the awesome open source community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-a-kubernetes-special-interest-group-sig\">Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG)</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is\na very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,\nserving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and\nreliability issues. <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2023/introducing-sig-etcd/\">Creating a dedicated SIG</a>\nallowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,\nand ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just\ndescribed being addressed, and to what extent?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and\ntransparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals</a>\nand PRRs (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">Production Readiness Reviews</a>,\nwhich has improved our feature development and release cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from\nbecoming a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like\n<a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a> and <a href=\"https://testgrid.k8s.io/\">TestGrid</a>. For large projects like\netcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear\ntools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also\nhelp etcd.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation\nfor addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes\necosystem.</p>\n<p>The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I’d like\nto highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd\ncontributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had\ngreater collaboration with other SIGs like <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Scalability</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Testing</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle\">SIG Cluster Lifecycle</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes\necosystem. The formation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-etcd-operator/README.md\">etcd Operator Working Group</a>\nunder the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful\ncollaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within\nKubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and\ncommunity involvement in recent months?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>James</strong>: Yes -- as showing in our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/23/prs-authors-repository-groups?orgId=1&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000\">unique PR author data</a>\nwe recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Unique PR author data stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Additionally, looking at our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-metric=contributions&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;var-country_name=All&amp;var-company_name=All&amp;var-company=all\">overall contributions across all etcd project repositories</a>\nwe are also observing a positive trend showing a resurgence in etcd project activity:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overall contributions stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The road ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current\npriorities for SIG etcd?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Reliability is always top of mind -– we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also\nworking on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making\netcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of\ncourse, scaling -– we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure\nnot only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve\nthe understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points\nthat the community cares about the most.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: SIG API Machinery, for sure – they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're\nconstantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle – etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,\nso we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG\nScalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the\nevolving cloud native landscape?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The\ncloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how\ncan they get involved?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md#meetings\">SIG etcd meetings</a>,\nfollow discussions on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev\">etcd-dev mailing list</a>, and check\nout our <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues\">GitHub issues</a>. We're always looking for people to\nreview proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: I love this question 😀 . There are numerous ways for people interested in contributing\nto SIG etcd to get involved and make a difference. Here are some key areas where you can help:</p>\n<p><strong>Code Contributions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Bug Fixes</em>: Tackle existing issues in the etcd codebase.

Check the\netcd roadmap and discussions to see what's being planned and where your skills might fit in.</li>\n<li><em>Testing and Code Reviews</em>: Help ensure the quality of etcd by writing tests, reviewing code\nchanges, and providing feedback.</li>\n<li><em>Documentation</em>: Improve <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/\">etcd's documentation</a> by adding new content,\nclarifying existing information, or fixing errors. Clear and comprehensive documentation is\nessential for users and contributors.</li>\n<li><em>Community Support</em>: Answer questions on forums, mailing lists, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C3HD8ARJ5\">Slack channels</a>.\nHelping others understand and use etcd is a valuable contribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Getting Started</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Join the community</em>: Start by joining the etcd community on Slack,\nattending SIG meetings, and following the mailing lists. This will\nhelp you get familiar with the project, its processes, and the\npeople involved.</li>\n<li><em>Find a mentor</em>: If you're new to open source or etcd, consider\nfinding a mentor who can guide you and provide support. Stay tuned!\nOur first cohort of mentorship program was very successful. We will\nhave a new round of mentorship program coming up.</li>\n<li><em>Start small</em>: Don't be afraid to start with small contributions. Even\nfixing a typo in the documentation or submitting a simple bug fix\ncan be a great way to get involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By contributing to etcd, you'll not only be helping to improve a\ncritical piece of the cloud-native ecosystem but also gaining valuable\nexperience and skills. So, jump in and start contributing!</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. Lastly, one piece of advice that\nyou'd like to give to other newly formed SIGs?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! My advice would be to embrace the established\nprocesses of the larger community, prioritize collaboration with other\nSIGs, and focus on building a strong community.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Here are some tips I myself found very helpful in my OSS\njourney:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Be patient</em>: Open source development can take time. Don't get\ndiscouraged if your contributions aren't accepted immediately or if\nyou encounter challenges.</li>\n<li><em>Be respectful</em>: The etcd community values collaboration and\nrespect. Be mindful of others' opinions and work together to achieve\ncommon goals.</li>\n<li><em>Have fun</em>: Contributing to open source should be\nenjoyable. Find areas that interest you and contribute in ways that\nyou find fulfilling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Frederico: A great way to end this spotlight, thank you all!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>For more information and resources, please take a look at :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>etcd website: <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">https://etcd.io/</a></li>\n<li>etcd GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd\">https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd</a></li>\n<li>etcd community: <a href=\"https://etcd.io/community/\">https://etcd.io/community/</a></li>\n</ol>",

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/",
      "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000",
      "summary": "<p>A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature\nin Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of\n1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the\niptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent\nkernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even\nonce nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the <em>default</em>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-1-data-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latency</h2>\n<p>The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and\nhas problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large\nKubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.</p>\n<p>In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a\nnumber of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of\nServices and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top\nlevel of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service\nIP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code># If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain\n# KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O\n# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT\n# etc...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK\n</code></pre><p>This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel\nto check it against all of the Service rules is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number\nof Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and\nthe worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection\nincreases (with the difference between best-case, average, and\nworst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP\naddress appears earlier or later in the <code>KUBE-SERVICES</code> chain).</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like\nthis is to have a <em>single</em> rule, using a &quot;verdict map&quot; to do the\ndispatch:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>table ip kube-proxy {\n# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.\nmap service-ips {\ntype ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict\ncomment \"ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic\"\nelements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,\n172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,\n172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,\n... }\n}\n# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an\n# element in the map. (This rule says, \"construct a tuple from the\n# destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look\n# that tuple up in \"service-ips\"; and if there's a match, execute the\n# associated verdict.)\nchain services {\nip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips\n}\n...\n}\n</code></pre><p>Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly <strong>O(1)</strong> map lookup,\npacket processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster\nsize, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/nftables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the\niptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000\nServices, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as\nthe p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000\nService cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for\nnftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few\nmicroseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to\nsquint to see the nftables results!:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-2-control-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latency</h2>\n<p>While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are\ngreat, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often\nkeeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:\nthe time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when\nServices and their endpoints change.</p>\n<p>With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a\nwhole (actual rules, plus associated data) is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the combined\nnumber of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables\nbackend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of\nthousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of\niptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving\nkube-proxy so that it could skip updating <em>most</em> of the unchanged\nrules in each update, but the limitations of <code>iptables-restore</code> as an\nAPI meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's\n<strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller\nconstant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can\nstill be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's <code>minSyncPeriod</code> config\noption to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to\npush iptables updates.</p>\n<p>The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and\nwhen kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the\nupdate is only <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services and endpoints that\nhave changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of\nServices and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each\nnftables-using component to have its own private table also means that\nthere is no global lock contention between components like with\niptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much\nmore efficiently than with iptables.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-nftables\">Why <em>not</em> nftables?</h2>\n<p>All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump\nright into using the nftables backend for now.</p>\n<p>First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit\ntests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in\nthe real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as\nmuch real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise\nthat it is as stable and bug-free.</p>\n<p>Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;\ncurrently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of\nbugs in early versions of the <code>nft</code> command line tool, you should not\nrun kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier\nthan 1.0.0) version of <code>nft</code> in the host filesystem (or else\nkube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables\non the system).</p>\n<p>Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such\nas the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet\nsupport kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the\ndocumentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components\nto see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they\nwill not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or\noverride kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether\nkube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability\nand monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data\nfor kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in\niptables mode.</p>\n<p>Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%\ncompatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old\nkube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less\nperformant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that\nchanging the default would be a compatibility break. Since the\nnftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad\ndefaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In\nparticular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only\nreachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable\non all IPs, including <code>127.0.0.1</code>, with iptables mode.) The\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">kube-proxy documentation</a> has more information about this, including\ninformation about metrics you can look at to determine if you are\nrelying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration\noptions are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-out-nftables-mode\">Trying out nftables mode</h2>\n<p>Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to\npass <code>--proxy-mode nftables</code> to kube-proxy (or set <code>mode: nftables</code> in\nyour kube-proxy config file).</p>\n<p>If you are using kubeadm to set up your cluster, the kubeadm\ndocumentation explains <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/#customizing-kube-proxy\">how to pass a <code>KubeProxyConfiguration</code> to\n<code>kubeadm init</code></a>. You can also <a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#kube-proxy-mode\">deploy nftables-based clusters with\n<code>kind</code></a>.</p>\n<p>You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to\nnftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the\nkube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting\nin nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs\nrules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs\nmode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-plans\">Future plans</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, while nftables is now the <em>best</em> kube-proxy mode,\nit is not the <em>default</em>, and we do not yet have a plan for changing\nthat. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.</p>\n<p>The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main\nadvantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of\nthe IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes\n(for example, the fact that the <code>kube-ipvs0</code> device needs to have\n<em>every</em> Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of\nKubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement\nusing IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have\ndifferent endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a\nlocal or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same\nperformance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of\nthe downsides:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy ipvs-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/ipvs-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use\nvarious other IPVS functionality, like alternative &quot;schedulers&quot; for\nbalancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,\nbecause kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS\nschedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the\nproxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic\nmore cleverly.)</p>\n<p>While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop\nthe IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people\nwho are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode\ninstead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in\nnftables mode that you can't work around).</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md\">KEP-3866: Add an nftables-based kube-proxy backend</a>&quot; has the\nhistory of the new feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yOGHb2HjslY?si=6O4PVJu7fGpReo1U\">How the Tables Have Turned: Kubernetes Says Goodbye to IPTables</a>&quot;,\nfrom KubeCon/CloudNativeCon North America 2024, talks about porting\nkube-proxy and Calico from iptables to nftables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uYo2O3jbJLk?si=py2AXzMJZ4PuhxNg\">From Observability to Performance</a>&quot;, from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon\nNorth America 2024.

The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information,\nlike the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the\nNode, Region and Instance type information.</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-medium \">\n<img alt=\"Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/14/cloud-controller-manager-chicken-egg-problem/ccm-chicken-egg-problem-sequence-diagram.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet\nwas able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved\nto the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg\">chicken and egg problem</a>\nduring the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the\ncontroller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,\nstandalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using\n<code>hostNetwork</code> (more on this below)</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-the-dependency-problem\">Examples of the dependency problem</h2>\n<p>As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be\nunschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p>\n<p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-uninitialized-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding <code>Node</code> object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a <code>Deployment</code>\nor <code>DaemonSet</code>, may not be able to schedule.</p>\n<p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting <code>Node</code> objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-not-ready-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3>\n<p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#node-kubernetes-io-not-ready\">Kubernetes documentation describes</a> the <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p>\n<p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-recommendations\">Our Recommendations</h2>\n<p>There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).</li>\n<li>Use a scalable resource type. <code>Deployments</code> and <code>DaemonSets</code> are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li>\n<li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol>\n<li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n<p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is\nimportant to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please\nconsult your cloud provider’s documentation.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nname: cloud-controller-manager\nnamespace: kube-system\nspec:\nreplicas: 2\nselector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nstrategy:\ntype: Recreate\ntemplate:\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nannotations:\nkubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure\nspec:\ncontainers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager\n- name: cloud-controller-manager\ncommand:\n- /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager\n- --leader-elect=true\n- -v=1\nimage: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest\nresources:\nrequests:\ncpu: 200m\nmemory: 50Mi\nhostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane\nnodeSelector:\nnode-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\"\naffinity:\npodAntiAffinity:\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n- topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\nlabelSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\ntolerations:\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\n</code></pre><p>When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that\ncluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple\nreplicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and\nredundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance\nof a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.</p>",

Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kirsten Garrison (KG)</strong>: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and\ncurrently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with\nthe help of <a href=\"https://github.com/carolynvs\">Carolyn Van Slyck</a>. With time, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.17/release_team.md\">I joined the Release\nteam</a>,\neventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I\nworked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in\nprocess) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and\ncontributing to the Subproject’s work.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of\nintervention?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/README.md#enhancements\">Enhancements\nSubproject</a>\nprimarily concerns itself with the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/0000-kep-process/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement\nProposal</a>\n(<em>KEP</em> for short)—the &quot;design&quot; documents required for all features and significant changes\nto the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kep-and-its-impact\">The KEP and its impact</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily\ninvolved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/#the-release-cycle\">Every release</a>, the SIGs let the\nRelease Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned\nabove, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors\nmust fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages\">will move\nthrough 3\nphases</a>:\nalpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.</p>\n<p>The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md\">KEP\ntemplate</a>\nhas different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed\ndiscussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and\nperformance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review\nteam and the Production Readiness Review team<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#fn:1\">1</a></sup> before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is\nlooking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and\nperformant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and\nmerge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most\nsignificant improvements of that approach?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on\nthe core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way\nto discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP\nprocess is communication and consideration.</p>\n<p>To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP\ntemplate. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancements</a> repo into its current form -- a\ndirectory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with\nProposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted\ntoday, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process\nin place over time.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single\nfeature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user\nexpectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The\naddition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements\n(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-areas-of-focus\">Current areas of focus</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: Speaking of maturing, we’ve <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/\">recently released Kubernetes\nv1.31</a>, and work on v1.32 <a href=\"https://github.com/fsmunoz/sig-release/tree/release-1.32/releases/release-1.32\">has\nstarted</a>. Are there\nany areas that the Enhancements sub-project is currently addressing that might change the way things\nare done?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: We’re currently working on two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Creating a Process KEP template.</em> Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for\nsignificant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to\nsupport this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so\nwill only encourage more discussion and transparency.</li>\n<li><em>KEP versioning.</em> While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we\nbelieve that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with\na versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we\nbelieve that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were\nintroduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was\nthis a particular area of focus for the subproject?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away\nfrom using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has\nalways been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition\nto an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads &quot;opt-in&quot; KEPs for release tracking. This\nhelped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken\non a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid\nintroducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the\nSubproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection\nprocess. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native\nlabels on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancement</a> issues and project boards.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the\nEnhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to\ndecisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to\ngive an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the\nRelease Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a\ngreat success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in\nthe KEP process!</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the\nrequired skills for participating in the sub-project?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the\nkubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take\nit from there.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to\nshare with our readers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires\nenormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it\nsuccessful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the\nproject great. This is truly a wonderful community.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>For more information, check the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/11/02/sig-architecture-production-readiness-spotlight-2023/\">Production Readiness Review spotlight\ninterview</a>\nin this series.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#fnref:1\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

A group snapshot represents <em>copies</em> made from multiple volumes, that\nare taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate\nnew volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to\na previous state (represented by the snapshots).</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-add-volume-group-snapshots-to-kubernetes\">Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes?</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that\nautomates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block\nand file storage.</p>\n<p>Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability:\nKubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and\nunderlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the\ncluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</p>\n<p>There was already a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/\">VolumeSnapshot</a> API\nthat provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against\ndata loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities\nnot covered by the VolumeSnapshot API.</p>\n<p>Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be\ntaken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency.\nThis can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example,\nan application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume.\nIf snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times,\nthe application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored\nfrom those snapshots when a disaster strikes.</p>\n<p>It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from\neach volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the\napplication after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get\napplication consistent snapshots.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes the application quiesce can be so time consuming that you want to do it less frequently,\nor it may not be possible to quiesce an application at all.\nFor example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce\nand nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which\nprovides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-apis-for-volume-group-snapshots\">Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes' support for <em>volume group snapshots</em> relies on three API kinds that\nare used\nfor managing snapshots:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshot</dt>\n<dd>Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request\ncreation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the\ntimestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use.\nThe creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a\ncluster resource (a group snapshot).</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</dt>\n<dd>Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group\nsnapshot ID.\nThis object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot).\nThe VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it\nwas created with a one-to-one mapping.</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotClass</dt>\n<dd>Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be\ncreated, including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These three API kinds are defined as\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">CustomResourceDefinitions</a>\n(CRDs).\nThese CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support\nvolume group snapshots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-components-are-needed-to-support-volume-group-snapshots\">What components are needed to support volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Volume group snapshots are implemented in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter\">external-snapshotter</a> repository.\nImplementing volume group snapshots meant adding or changing several components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs.</li>\n<li>Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller.</li>\n<li>Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The volume snapshot controller and CRDs are deployed once per\ncluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as a cluster addon.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends that Kubernetes distributors\nbundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part\nof their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-beta\">What's new in Beta?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The VolumeGroupSnapshot feature in CSI spec moved to GA in the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/releases/tag/v1.11.0\">v1.11.0 release</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The snapshot validation webhook was deprecated in external-snapshotter v8.0.0 and it is now removed.\nMost of the validation webhook logic was added as validation rules into the CRDs.\nMinimum required Kubernetes version is 1.25 for these validation rules.\nOne thing in the validation webhook not moved to CRDs is the prevention of creating\nmultiple default volume snapshot classes and multiple default volume group snapshot classes\nfor the same CSI driver.\nWith the removal of the validation webhook, an error will still be raised when dynamically\nprovisioning a VolumeSnapshot or VolumeGroupSnapshot when multiple default volume snapshot\nclasses or multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver exist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>enable-volumegroup-snapshot</code> flag in the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter\nsidecar has been replaced by a feature gate.\nSince VolumeGroupSnapshot is a new API, the feature moves to Beta but the feature gate is\ndisabled by default.\nTo use this feature, enable the feature gate by adding the flag <code>--feature-gates=CSIVolumeGroupSnapshot=true</code>\nwhen starting the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The logic to dynamically create the VolumeGroupSnapshot and its corresponding individual\nVolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects are moved from the CSI snapshotter to the common\nsnapshot-controller.\nNew RBAC rules are added to the common snapshot-controller and some RBAC rules are removed from\nthe CSI snapshotter sidecar accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots\">How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots</h2>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-new-group-snapshot-with-kubernetes\">Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to\nsnapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot\nobject.</p>\n<p>The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot\nshould be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent\nshould be used.</p>\n<p>A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a cluster administrator.\nIt contains the details of the real volume group snapshot on the storage system which\nis available for use by cluster users.</p>\n<p>One of the following members in the source of the group snapshot must be set.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>selector</code> - a label query over PersistentVolumeClaims that are to be grouped\ntogether for snapshotting. This selector will be used to match the label\nadded to a PVC.</li>\n<li><code>volumeGroupSnapshotContentName</code> - specifies the name of a pre-existing\nVolumeGroupSnapshotContent object representing an existing volume group snapshot.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"dynamically-provision-a-group-snapshot\">Dynamically provision a group snapshot</h4>\n<p>In the following example, there are two PVCs.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">pvc-0 Bound pvc-6e1f7d34-a5c5-4548-b104-01e72c72b9f2 100Mi RWO csi-hostpath-sc &lt;unset&gt;

      "summary": "<p>Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing.\nA significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by <strong>list</strong> requests.</p>\n<p>In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes <strong>list</strong> requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client.\nBut what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple <strong>list</strong> requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage.\nWhile <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/\">API Priority and Fairness</a> has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection.\nThis can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded.\nThis situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let's consider the below graph.</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Monitoring graph showing kube-apiserver memory usage\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/17/kube-apiserver-api-streaming/kube-apiserver-memory_usage.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test.\n(see the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#the-synthetic-test\">synthetic test</a> section for more details).\nThe results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server's memory consumption.\nNotably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-kube-apiserver-allocate-so-much-memory-for-list-requests\">Why does kube-apiserver allocate so much memory for list requests?</h2>\n<p>Our investigation revealed that this substantial memory allocation occurs because the server before sending the first byte to the client must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fetch data from the database,</li>\n<li>deserialize the data from its stored format,</li>\n<li>and finally construct the final response by converting and serializing the data into a client requested format</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This sequence results in significant temporary memory consumption.\nThe actual usage depends on many factors like the page size, applied filters (e.g. label selectors), query parameters, and sizes of individual objects.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, neither <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/\">API Priority and Fairness</a> nor Golang's garbage collection or Golang memory limits can prevent the system from exhausting memory under these conditions.\nThe memory is allocated suddenly and rapidly, and just a few requests can quickly deplete the available memory, leading to resource exhaustion.</p>\n<p>Depending on how the API server is run on the node, it might either be killed through OOM by the kernel when exceeding the configured memory limits during these uncontrolled spikes, or if limits are not configured it might have even worse impact on the control plane node.\nAnd worst, after the first API server failure, the same requests will likely hit another control plane node in an HA setup with probably the same impact.\nPotentially a situation that is hard to diagnose and hard to recover from.</p>\n<h2 id=\"streaming-list-requests\">Streaming list requests</h2>\n<p>Today, we're excited to announce a major improvement.\nWith the graduation of the <em>watch list</em> feature to beta in Kubernetes 1.32, client-go users can opt-in (after explicitly enabling <code>WatchListClient</code> feature gate)\nto streaming lists by switching from <strong>list</strong> to (a special kind of) <strong>watch</strong> requests.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch</strong> requests are served from the <em>watch cache</em>, an in-memory cache designed to improve scalability of read operations.\nBy streaming each item individually instead of returning the entire collection, the new method maintains constant memory overhead.\nThe API server is bound by the maximum allowed size of an object in etcd plus a few additional allocations.\nThis approach drastically reduces the temporary memory usage compared to traditional <strong>list</strong> requests, ensuring a more efficient and stable system,\nespecially in clusters with a large number of objects of a given type or large average object sizes where despite paging memory consumption used to be high.</p>\n<p>Building on the insight gained from the synthetic test (see the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#the-synthetic-test\">synthetic test</a>, we developed an automated performance test to systematically evaluate the impact of the <em>watch list</em> feature.\nThis test replicates the same scenario, generating a large number of Secrets with a large payload, and scaling the number of informers to simulate heavy <strong>list</strong> request patterns.\nThe automated test is executed periodically to monitor memory usage of the server with the feature enabled and disabled.</p>\n<p>The results showed significant improvements with the <em>watch list</em> feature enabled.\nWith the feature turned on, the kube-apiserver’s memory consumption stabilized at approximately <strong>2 GB</strong>.\nBy contrast, with the feature disabled, memory usage increased to approximately <strong>20GB</strong>, a <strong>10x</strong> increase!\nThese results confirm the effectiveness of the new streaming API, which reduces the temporary memory footprint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-api-streaming-for-your-component\">Enabling API Streaming for your component</h2>\n<p>Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.32. Make sure your cluster uses etcd in version 3.4.31+ or 3.5.13+.\nChange your client software to use watch lists. If your client code is written in Golang, you'll want to enable <code>WatchListClient</code> for client-go.\nFor details on enabling that feature, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/12/feature-gates-in-client-go\">Introducing Feature Gates to Client-Go: Enhancing Flexibility and Control</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes 1.32, the feature is enabled in kube-controller-manager by default despite its beta state.\nThis will eventually be expanded to other core components like kube-scheduler or kubelet; once the feature becomes generally available, if not earlier.\nOther 3rd-party components are encouraged to opt-in to the feature during the beta phase, especially when they are at risk of accessing a large number of resources or kinds with potentially large object sizes.</p>\n<p>For the time being, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/\">API Priority and Fairness</a> assigns a reasonable small cost to <strong>list</strong> requests.\nThis is necessary to allow enough parallelism for the average case where <strong>list</strong> requests are cheap enough.\nBut it does not match the spiky exceptional situation of many and large objects.\nOnce the majority of the Kubernetes ecosystem has switched to <em>watch list</em>, the <strong>list</strong> cost estimation can be changed to larger values without risking degraded performance in the average case,\nand with that increasing the protection against this kind of requests that can still hit the API server in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-synthetic-test\">The synthetic test</h2>\n<p>In order to reproduce the issue, we conducted a manual test to understand the impact of <strong>list</strong> requests on kube-apiserver memory usage.\nIn the test, we created 400 Secrets, each containing 1 MB of data, and used informers to retrieve all Secrets.</p>\n<p>The results were alarming, only 16 informers were needed to cause the test server to run out of memory and crash, demonstrating how quickly memory consumption can grow under such conditions.</p>\n<p>Special shout out to <a href=\"https://github.com/deads2k\">@deads2k</a> for his help in shaping this feature.</p>",

You can only use the\npolicy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-feature\">Understanding the feature</h2>\n<p>The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#explicitly-reserved-cpu-list\">Explicitly Reserved CPU List</a> page.</p>\n<p>If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> option.</p>\n<p>However, until the Kubernetes v1.32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed\npods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs. At pod admission time, the kubelet only\ncompares the CPU <em>requests</em> against the allocatable CPUs. In Kubernetes, limits can be higher than\nthe requests; the previous implementation allowed burstable and best-effort pods to use up\nthe capacity of <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code>, which could then starve host OS services of CPU - and we\nknow that people saw this in real life deployments.\nThe existing behavior also made benchmarking (for both infrastructure and workloads) results inaccurate.</p>\n<p>When this new <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option is enabled, the CPU Manager static policy will not allow any workload to use the reserved system CPU cores.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-the-feature\">Enabling the feature</h2>\n<p>To enable this feature, you need to turn on both the <code>CPUManagerPolicyAlphaOptions</code> feature gate and the <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option.

Since that attempt, the cluster\nhasn't changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable.</li>\n<li>The Pods are blocked from entering the scheduling cycles by PreEnqueue Plugins,\nfor example, they have a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/#configuring-pod-schedulinggates\">scheduling gate</a>,\nand get blocked by the scheduling gate plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"scheduling-framework-and-plugins\">Scheduling framework and plugins</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes scheduler is implemented following the Kubernetes\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/\">scheduling framework</a>.</p>\n<p>And, all scheduling features are implemented as plugins\n(e.g., <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity\">Pod affinity</a>\nis implemented in the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin.)</p>\n<p>The scheduler processes pending Pods in phases called <em>cycles</em> as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scheduling cycle</strong>: the scheduler takes pending Pods from the activeQ component of the scheduling\nqueue <em>one by one</em>. For each Pod, the scheduler runs the filtering/scoring logic from every scheduling plugin. The\nscheduler then decides on the best node for the Pod, or decides that the Pod can't be scheduled at that time.</p>\n<p>If the scheduler decides that a Pod can't be scheduled, that Pod enters the Unschedulable Pod Pool\ncomponent of the scheduling queue. However, if the scheduler decides to place the Pod on a node,\nthe Pod goes to the binding cycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Binding cycle</strong>: the scheduler communicates the node placement decision to the Kubernetes API\nserver. This operation bounds the Pod to the selected node.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Aside from some exceptions, most unscheduled Pods enter the unschedulable pod pool after each scheduling\ncycle. The Unschedulable Pod Pool component is crucial because of how the scheduling cycle processes Pods one by one. If the scheduler had to constantly retry placing unschedulable Pods, instead of offloading those\nPods to the Unschedulable Pod Pool, multiple scheduling cycles would be wasted on those Pods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improvements-to-retrying-pod-scheduling-with-queuinghint\">Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint</h2>\n<p>Unschedulable Pods only move back into the ActiveQ or BackoffQ components of the scheduling\nqueue if changes in the cluster might allow the scheduler to place those Pods on nodes.</p>\n<p>Prior to v1.32, each plugin registered which cluster changes could solve their failures, an object creation, update, or deletion in the cluster (called <em>cluster events</em>),\nwith <code>EnqueueExtensions</code> (<code>EventsToRegister</code>),\nand the scheduling queue retries a pod with an event that is registered by a plugin that rejected the pod in a previous scheduling cycle.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we had an internal feature called <code>preCheck</code>, which helped further filtering of events for efficiency, based on Kubernetes core scheduling constraints;\nFor example, <code>preCheck</code> could filter out node-related events when the node status is <code>NotReady</code>.</p>\n<p>However, we had two issues for those approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requeueing with events was too broad, could lead to scheduling retries for no reason.\n<ul>\n<li>A new scheduled Pod <em>might</em> solve the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>'s failure, but not all of them do.\nFor example, if a new Pod is created, but without a label matching <code>InterPodAffinity</code> of the unschedulable pod, the pod wouldn't be schedulable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>preCheck</code> relied on the logic of in-tree plugins and was not extensible to custom plugins,\nlike in issue <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110175\">#110175</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here QueueingHints come into play;\na QueueingHint subscribes to a particular kind of cluster event, and make a decision about whether each incoming event could make the Pod schedulable.</p>\n<p>For example, consider a Pod named <code>pod-a</code> that has a required Pod affinity. <code>pod-a</code> was rejected in\nthe scheduling cycle by the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin because no node had an existing Pod that matched\nthe Pod affinity specification for <code>pod-a</code>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/12/scheduler-queueinghint/queueinghint1.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><code>pod-a</code> moves into the Unschedulable Pod Pool. The scheduling queue records which plugin caused\nthe scheduling failure for the Pod. For <code>pod-a</code>, the scheduling queue records that the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>\nplugin rejected the Pod.</p>\n<p><code>pod-a</code> will never be schedulable until the InterPodAffinity failure is resolved.\nThere're some scenarios that the failure could be resolved, one example is an existing running pod gets a label update and becomes matching a Pod affinity.\nFor this scenario, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> callback function checks every Pod label update that occurs in the cluster.\nThen, if a Pod gets a label update that matches the Pod affinity requirement of <code>pod-a</code>, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>,\nplugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> prompts the scheduling queue to move <code>pod-a</code> back into the ActiveQ or\nthe BackoffQ component.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a being moved by InterPodAffinity QueueingHint\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/12/scheduler-queueinghint/queueinghint2.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a being moved by InterPodAffinity QueueingHint</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"queueinghint-s-history-and-what-s-new-in-v1-32\">QueueingHint's history and what's new in v1.32</h2>\n<p>At SIG Scheduling, we have been working on the development of QueueingHint since\nKubernetes v1.28.</p>\n<p>While QueuingHint isn't user-facing, we implemented the <code>SchedulerQueueingHints</code> feature gate as a\nsafety measure when we originally added this feature. In v1.28, we implemented QueueingHints with a\nfew in-tree plugins experimentally, and made the feature gate enabled by default.</p>\n<p>However, users reported a memory leak, and consequently we disabled the feature gate in a\npatch release of v1.28. From v1.28 until v1.31, we kept working on the QueueingHint implementation\nwithin the rest of the in-tree plugins and fixing bugs.</p>\n<p>In v1.32, we made this feature enabled by default again. We finished implementing QueueingHints\nin all plugins and also identified the cause of the memory leak!</p>\n<p>We thank all the contributors who participated in the development of this feature and those who reported and investigated the earlier issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p>These features are managed by Kubernetes <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG Scheduling</a>.</p>\n<p>Please join us and share your feedback.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn more?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/4247-queueinghint/README.md\">KEP-4247: Per-plugin callback functions for efficient requeueing in the scheduling queue</a></li>\n</ul>",

By eliminating the need for a third-party driver to validate or test allocations, this\nfeature improves planning and decision-making for resource distribution, making the scheduling and scaling processes\nmore efficient.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381\">KEP #4381</a>, by WG Device\nManagement (a cross functional team containing <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG Node</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG Scheduling</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling\">SIG\nAutoscaling</a>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"label-and-field-selector-authorization\">Label and field selector authorization</h3>\n<p>Label and field selectors can be used in authorization decisions.

Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by\nevicting lower-priority ones, but this process previously involved heavy operations like API calls to delete pods,\nslowing down the scheduler. With this enhancement, such tasks are now processed in parallel, allowing the scheduler to\ncontinue scheduling other pods without delays.\nThis improvement is particularly beneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a\nmore efficient and resilient scheduling process.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of KEP <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4832\">#4832</a>\nby <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling\">SIG Scheduling</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mutating-admission-policies-using-cel-expressions\">Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions</h3>\n<p>This feature leverages CEL's object instantiation and JSON Patch strategies, combined with Server Side Apply’s merge\nalgorithms. It simplifies policy definition, reduces mutation conflicts, and enhances admission control performance\nwhile laying a foundation for more robust, extensible policy frameworks in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes API server now supports Common Expression Language (CEL)-based Mutating Admission Policies, providing a\nlightweight, efficient alternative to mutating admission webhooks. With this enhancement, administrators can use CEL to\ndeclare mutations like setting labels, defaulting fields, or injecting sidecars with simple, declarative expressions.\nThis approach reduces operational complexity, eliminates the need for webhooks, and integrates directly with the\nkube-apiserver, offering faster and more reliable in-process mutation handling.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3962\">KEP #3962</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-level-resource-specifications\">Pod-level resource specifications</h3>\n<p>This enhancement simplifies resource management in Kubernetes by introducing the ability to set resource requests and\nlimits at the Pod level, creating a shared pool that all containers in the Pod can dynamically use. This is particularly\nvaluable for workloads with containers that have fluctuating or bursty resource needs, as it minimizes over-provisioning\nand improves overall resource efficiency.</p>\n<p>By leveraging Linux cgroup settings at the Pod level, Kubernetes ensures that these resource limits are enforced while\nenabling tightly coupled containers to collaborate more effectively without hitting artificial constraints. Importantly,\nthis feature maintains backward compatibility with existing container-level resource settings, allowing users to adopt\nit incrementally without disrupting current workflows or existing configurations.</p>\n<p>This marks a significant improvement for multi-container pods, as it reduces the operational complexity of managing\nresource allocations across containers. It also provides a performance boost for tightly integrated applications, such\nas sidecar architectures, where containers share workloads or depend on each other’s availability to perform optimally.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837\">KEP #2837</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG\nNode</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook\">Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook</h3>\n<p>This enhancement introduces the ability to set a zero-second sleep duration for the PreStop lifecycle hook in\nKubernetes, offering a more flexible and no-op option for resource validation and customization. Previously, attempting\nto define a zero value for the sleep action resulted in validation errors, restricting its use. With this update, users\ncan configure a zero-second duration as a valid sleep setting, enabling immediate execution and termination behaviors\nwhere needed.</p>\n<p>The enhancement is backward-compatible, introduced as an opt-in feature controlled by the\n<code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate. This change is particularly beneficial for scenarios requiring PreStop\nhooks for validation or admission webhook processing without requiring an actual sleep duration. By aligning with the\ncapabilities of the <code>time.After</code> Go function, this update simplifies configuration and expands usability for Kubernetes\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4818\">KEP #4818</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">SIG\nNode</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-standardized-network-interface-data-for-resource-claim-status\">DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status</h3>\n<p>This enhancement adds a new field that allows drivers to report specific device status data for each allocated object\nin a ResourceClaim. It also establishes a standardized way to represent networking devices information.</p>\n<p>This work was done as a part of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4817\">KEP #4817</a>, by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network\">SIG Network</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-statusz-and-flagz-endpoints-for-core-components\">New statusz and flagz endpoints for core components</h3>\n<p>You can enable two new HTTP endpoints, <code>/statusz</code> and <code>/flagz</code>, for core components.\nThese enhance cluster debuggability by gaining insight into what versions (e.g. Golang version) that component is\nrunning as, along with details about its uptime, and which command line flags that component was executed with;\nmaking it easier to diagnose both runtime and configuration issues.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4827\">KEP #4827</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4828\">KEP #4828</a> by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG Instrumentation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"windows-strikes-back\">Windows strikes back!</h3>\n<p>Support for graceful shutdowns of Windows nodes in Kubernetes clusters has been added.\nBefore this release, Kubernetes provided graceful node shutdown functionality for Linux nodes\nbut lacked equivalent support for Windows. This enhancement enables the kubelet on Windows nodes to handle system\nshutdown events properly. Doing so, it ensures that Pods running on Windows nodes are gracefully terminated,\nallowing workloads to be rescheduled without disruption. This improvement enhances the reliability and stability\nof clusters that include Windows nodes, especially during a planned maintenance or any system updates.</p>\n<p>Moreover CPU and memory affinity support has been added for Windows nodes with nodes, with improvements\nto the CPU manager, memory manager and topology manager.</p>\n<p>This work was done respectively as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4802\">KEP #4802</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4885\">KEP #4885</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-windows\">SIG\nWindows</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-deprecations-and-removals-in-1-32\">Graduations, deprecations, and removals in 1.32</h2>\n<h3 id=\"graduations-to-stable\">Graduations to Stable</h3>\n<p>This lists all the features that graduated to stable (also known as <em>general availability</em>).

Code related to the original\nimplementation will be removed, leaving KEP <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381\">#4381</a> as the &quot;new&quot;\nbase functionality.</p>\n<p>The decision to change the existing approach originated from its incompatibility with cluster autoscaling as resource\navailability was non-transparent, complicating decision-making for both Cluster Autoscaler and controllers.\nThe newly added Structured Parameter model substitutes the functionality.</p>\n<p>This removal will allow Kubernetes to handle new hardware requirements and resource claims more predictably, bypassing\nthe complexities of back and forth API calls to the kube-apiserver.</p>\n<p>See the enhancement issue <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063\">#3063</a> to find out more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"api-removals\">API removals</h4>\n<p>There is one API removal in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32\">Kubernetes v1.32</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3</code> API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed.\nTo prepare for this, you can edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the\n<code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API</code> version, available since v1.29.\nAll existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3\ninclude that the PriorityLevelConfiguration <code>spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares</code> field only defaults to 30 when\nunspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32\">API deprecation guide</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"release-notes-and-upgrade-actions-required\">Release notes and upgrade actions required</h3>\n<p>Check out the full details of the Kubernetes v1.32 release in our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md\">release\nnotes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\">Availability</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.32 is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.32.0\">GitHub</a> or\non the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/\">Kubernetes download page</a>.</p>\n<p>To get started with Kubernetes, check out these <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/\">interactive tutorials</a> or run local Kubernetes\nclusters using <a href=\"https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/\">minikube</a>.

      "summary": "<p>At GitLab, we’ve implemented an innovative approach to improving our experience called <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-design/#beautifying-our-ui\">Beautifying our UI</a>. This unique initiative pairs one product designer with a frontend engineer for a milestone or two, and empowers them to make self-directed usability improvements across the platform. Ultimately, this helps build a more polished product experience, as these pairs can quickly address pain points, refine interactions, and deliver thoughtful improvements that make the platform more efficient and enjoyable to use.</p>\n<p>In this iteration, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/anna_vovchenko\">Anna Vovchenko</a> and I decided to focus on the continuous deployment (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/#what-is-continuous-deployment\">CD</a>) area of the product. Here is how we did it and what we learned.</p>\n<h2>Trying something new</h2>\n<p>As this was our second round going through the process, we wanted to make several small adjustments that in the end helped us deliver even more quality improvements to the product. These process improvements included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extended timeline:</strong> We decided this time around we wanted to extend the initiative to span two milestones. This gave us the time to tackle more complex problems, but also gave us space for additional planning at the start.</li>\n<li><strong>Structured planning:</strong> While it was encouraged in the past to work directly in merge requests, we found it helped to use the initial issue as a place to plan and seek out problems ahead of time. Rather than purely focusing on the ad-hoc, we incorporated a planning phase similar to milestone planning, helping the partnership identify and prioritize potential improvements beforehand.</li>\n<li><strong>Product manager integration:</strong> As we focused on one area for this round of the project, we also decided to involve the product manager of the team more actively in the process. This ensured alignment on larger changes, reduced surprises when MRs were merged and allowed us to gather valuable feedback throughout the implementation.</li>\n<li><strong>Engaging the community:</strong> We expanded our improvement efforts by inviting contributions from community members, accelerating our ability to implement fixes and enhancements across the platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic timing:</strong> We chose to run this iteration during a traditionally slower period, allowing teams to focus more deeply on these improvements without competing priorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These refinements maintained the initiative's core strength of direct designer-engineer collaboration, while adding structure that helped our pair work more effectively.</p>\n<h2>What were the main improvements?</h2>\n<p>During the two milestones, our pairing implemented several significant improvements that enhance the user experience across the CD space. Here's a look at what we accomplished:</p>\n<h3>Enhanced environment list view</h3>\n<p>One of the larger changes made during this cycle of \"Beautifying our UI\" was a redesigned Environment List page to make deployment information more accessible. Previously, users had to click through collapsible sections to view crucial deployment details, and viewing important details at a glance was difficult. Now, this information is immediately visible, bringing the most important deployment information to the forefront where users need it.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Environments page before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3PNIW6wr7PjXj56eIckxYR/118bd0134f6ef21dd4876e50842ba5d6/Before_Environments_Page.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong> The original design relied on collapsible sections, requiring users to click to reveal deployment information. This meant that users couldn't immediately see the status of their deployments, making it harder to quickly assess the state of their environments.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Environments page after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5IXx6EwEFpIlU5IpvlASUV/ab333877441cf3c2ea8dd722f095bac0/After_Environments_Page.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong> The new design surfaces critical deployment information directly in the list view, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployment status with clear visual indicators</li>\n<li>Who triggered the deployment along with timestamps</li>\n<li>Commit information and version tags</li>\n<li>Actions to take on the environment</li>\n<li>Latest deployment indicators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This redesign eliminates the need for extra clicks and gives users immediate visibility into their deployment and environment statuses. The new layout maintains a clean interface while presenting more actionable information upfront.</p>\n<h3>Improved deploy keys filtering</h3>\n<p>Another larger enhancement was made to our deploy keys interface to improve searchability while maintaining performance. This change addresses a critical user need for quickly finding specific deploy keys in large repositories, which was broken when pagination was introduced earlier last year.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Deploy key before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/0wZRhTpbwYkWBBLB8HhYn/83724f401fc61a85ea5d7f0cf9ebf1ee/Deploy_Key_Before.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong> The previous interface displayed deploy keys in a paginated list without a dedicated search function. While pagination helped with performance when handling thousands of keys, users had lost the ability to quickly search through their deploy keys using the browser search functionality, forcing them to manually scan through multiple pages.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Deploy key after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/63bgcl0bSSoGQXZW8Dx4Rk/7a6bb7e089be6d297690a29ff5e4b39a/Deploy_Key_After.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong> The new design introduces a dedicated search field at the top of the deploy keys list, allowing users to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly filter deploy keys by name or SHA</li>\n<li>Maintain the performance benefits of pagination</li>\n<li>Find specific keys without browsing through multiple pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This improvement strikes the right balance between performance and usability, especially beneficial for teams managing numerous deploy keys across multiple projects.</p>\n<h3>Better Kubernetes agent management</h3>\n<p>We made significant improvements to the Kubernetes agent experience by simplifying the registration process and providing better visibility into agent status. These enhancements work together to create a smoother onboarding experience for teams getting started.</p>\n<p>Our first area of focus was streamlining how users register agents when they have configuration files ready to use. Previously, this process had several pain points that we wanted to address.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Agent before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4nQ26pVg2pullsURbdUuUO/2ba71a65e0ff6227c611e806daeb4c5f/Agent_Before.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only showed connected and previously connected agents</li>\n<li>Connection status was limited to \"Never connected\" or \"Not connected\"</li>\n<li>No clear path to register new agents</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Agent after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/1khmWXmfgnZxLkImL98jqX/5d50e88e8398b292af8159c25c22865d/Agent_After.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new Available configurations tab showing all potential agent configurations</li>\n<li>Clear \"Register an agent\" call-to-action button for each available configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we turned our attention to making the agent registration modal more intuitive. The previous design created some confusion that we wanted to resolve.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Registration before\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/6UGHFXFRTWtMEOMRNnMC3n/308c56bff1ff25512962c9fa2a78ca38/Registration_Before.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users faced a confusing dual-purpose search box that both found existing agents and created new ones</li>\n<li>The workflow had too many decision points instead of a clear path forward</li>\n<li>The process for creating vs. selecting an agent wasn't clearly separated</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Beautifying UI - Registration after\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5IqK5YIFaVuVXh2p1zMf4t/575dfe8a2827e61204fe8322639c1294/Registration_After.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Separated the interface into two clear options: bootstrap with Flux or create an agent through the UI</li>\n<li>Streamlined the workflow into a more linear process</li>\n<li>Made the distinction between creating new agents and selecting existing ones more obvious</li>\n<li>Added a success message that clearly shows where to create the optional config file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These improvements make it immediately clear which agents need attention and provide a straightforward path to register new agents. The reorganized interface better supports both new users setting up their first agent and experienced users managing multiple agents.</p>\n<h2>Additional usability enhancements</h2>\n<p>While working on major interface improvements, we also addressed several focused usability issues that significantly improve the day-to-day experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Kubernetes pod search:</strong> Added search functionality for Kubernetes pods on the environment page, making it easier to locate specific pods in large deployments. This was showcased in the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/01/16/gitlab-17-8-released/#search-for-pods-on-the-dashboard-for-kubernetes\">GitLab 17.8 release post</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Flux status visibility:</strong> Added a \"stopped\" badge to the dashboard view when Flux sync is stopped, providing immediate visibility into sync status. This was also showcased in the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/01/16/gitlab-17-8-released/#view-paused-flux-reconciliations-on-the-dashboard-for-kubernetes\">GitLab 17.8 release post</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Better release information:</strong> Implemented a clear view of deployments related to a release, improving deployment tracking and visibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined environment search:</strong> Fixed an issue where users couldn't effectively search the Environments page, improving navigation in large environment lists.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced error message display:</strong> Resolved issues with viewing Flux details when long error messages were present, making troubleshooting more straightforward.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Looking forward</h2>\n<p>The success of these improvements demonstrates the value of empowering our teams to make direct, meaningful changes to our experience. Beyond the product enhancements, one of the most valuable outcomes has been the strengthened relationship between our Frontend and Design teams. Working together closely on these improvements has fostered better understanding of each other's perspectives, workflows, and constraints, leading to more effective collaboration.</p>\n<p>This deepened partnership has created a foundation for even better collaboration in our regular workflow, as team members now have stronger working relationships and shared understanding of each other's domains. We're excited to continue this initiative in future iterations, not just for the product improvements it generates, but also for its role in building stronger, more cohesive teams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/product-design/#beautifying-our-ui\">Follow along with the \"Beautifying our UI\" project</a> as we continue to make improvements to GitLab.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Read more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/08/15/navigation-research-blog-post/\">How we overhauled GitLab navigation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/10/15/gitlab-dark-mode-is-getting-a-new-look/\">GitLab dark mode is getting a new look</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/07/05/beautifying-of-our-ui/\">Beautifying our UI: Giving GitLab build features a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>In early 2024, we started a journey to implement better metrics for <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-operations/red-team/\">our internal Red Team</a>. Our first iteration focused on what we now call the adoption rate metric, which measures how often the recommendations our team makes are accepted and implemented.</p>\n<p>Choosing this metric was very deliberate. While there are many ways to measure a Red Team's impact, we wanted to start with something fundamental: Are we actually driving meaningful security improvements? The adoption rate directly ties our work to real security outcomes, and we could measure it using tools and processes we already had in place.</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll discover how we used GitLab to track these results end-to-end, some lessons we learned (including what we would have done differently), and our plans to tackle the next set of metrics.</p>\n<h2>How we implemented the adoption rate metric</h2>\n<p>We use GitLab extensively for our Red Team planning, execution, and reporting. Every operation wraps up with a report that's written in markdown in a dedicated GitLab project. Each report contains a section called \"Recommendations\" with a list of suggestions to make GitLab more secure.</p>\n<p>Those recommendations are always linked to a dedicated issue, which we open in the project closest to the team who can address it. If we're suggesting a product feature, it goes directly in that tracker. If it's a detection capability, it goes into the detections as code repository. We always assign a directly responsible individual (DRI) in the group that owns that space, and we use <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/redteam/redteam-public/resources/red-team-issue-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/recommendation.md?ref_type=heads\">this issue template</a> to ensure consistency in describing the problem, the risk, and potential solutions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Red team - recommendation-example\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/73y1KlWLKWijWmoQjPaS9z/6311f485b2a68bd16c64bd79b434c1eb/recommendation-example__1_.png\" /></p>\n<p>Here's where the tracking logistics come in. We use GitLab labels to classify the recommendation across three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detections and alerts (<code>RTRec::Detection</code>)</li>\n<li>Security controls (<code>RTRec::Control</code>)</li>\n<li>Processes and procedures (<code>RTRec::Process</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then use another set of labels to follow the lifecycle of that recommendation – from review all the way through adoption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under review (<code>RecOutcome::UnderReview</code>)</li>\n<li>Accepted and actively being worked on (<code>RecOutcome::InProgress</code>)</li>\n<li>Accepted but backlogged (<code>RecOutcome::Backlogged</code>)</li>\n<li>Accepted but blocked (<code>RecOutcome::Blocked</code>)</li>\n<li>Fully adopted and closed (<code>RecOutcome::Adopted</code>)</li>\n<li>Partially adopted and closed (<code>RecOutcome::PartiallyAdopted</code>)</li>\n<li>Not adopted and closed (<code>RecOutcome::NotAdopted</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we stay on top of recommendations</h2>\n<p>We use a new GitLab feature called <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/glql/\">\"GitLab Query Language\" (GLQL)</a> to build a dynamic Security Recommendations Dashboard inside a GitLab issue.</p>\n<p>This issue allows us to quickly identify things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>open recommendations that haven't been updated recently</li>\n<li>open recommendations that have been backlogged for an extended period of time</li>\n<li>closed recommendations that weren't properly labeled with an adoption outcome</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We've found this process encourages the Red Team to follow up on stale recommendations, reaching out to the owners and seeing how we can help get them adopted.</p>\n<p>GLQL is very cool, and allows us to turn a short code block like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">---  \ndisplay: table  \nfields: title, labels(\"RTRec::*\"), labels(\"RecOutcome::*\"), created, updated  \n---  \ngroup = \"gitlab-com\"  \nAND label = \"RTRec::*\"  \nAND opened = true  \n</code></pre>\n<p>... into a dynamic table like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Red Team - GLQL table\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2lPijOJclw45o0Qi6HqdXd/664f11ca26dc8f80e3e1508481ee3abe/glql-table.png\" /></p>\n<p>That table for us is very tactical and we use it to keep things moving. Beyond that, we also visualize the adoption rate trends over time. That allows us to look at things like quarterly adoption rate percentages, how long different types of recommendations take to adopt and implement, and how these figures vary across departments.</p>\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Start with metrics in place; don't wait for your program to mature first.</strong></p>\n<p>Early in our Red Team's development, we focused more on how we would execute operations and less on how we would measure them. The idea of using metrics to distill complex operations into simple numbers felt like it might oversimplify our work. But we've learned that thoughtful metrics don't reduce the value of Red Team operations - they help demonstrate our impact and guide our program's growth. Starting with clear metrics earlier would have accelerated this growth.</p>\n<p>Implementing these metrics later meant spending significant time reformatting years of historical recommendations to enable consistent analysis. Had we planned for metrics from the start, we could have saved ourselves a lot of time and effort.</p>\n<p>We’re keeping this lesson in mind as we start on our next set of metrics, threat resilience, which we talk about below.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Don't operate in a silo.</strong></p>\n<p>Red Teams aren't the only groups that provide recommendations in a security organization. At GitLab, we have our bug bounty program, our external pentests, product security, security assurance, and security operations.</p>\n<p>On the Red Team, we developed our own recommendations process from scratch. It's been fairly effective, but we have noticed some areas for improvement, particularly around prioritization, project management, and alignment with our organization's risk reporting process.</p>\n<p>We also noticed that some other teams are really good at these areas such as our bug bounty program and the triaging of findings from our external pentests. Those particular groups are very good at delivering product recommendations, and we've been learning from their approach to improve our own delivery methods.</p>\n<p>So we've taken our success with visualizing metrics and are integrating these lessons to create a more standard format that can be used across teams. This will allow us to leverage things that are working well, like our adoption rate metric, and combine them with the more efficiently managed processes used by other groups to ultimately achieve a higher adoption rate and a more secure GitLab.</p>\n<h2>Next up: Measuring our threat resilience</h2>\n<p>Next up for us is implementing metrics around threat resilience. We want to measure how well GitLab can prevent, detect, and respond to the threats most relevant to our organization. We're building a dashboard that will help visualize this data, showing our top threat actors and a series of scores that measure how well we defend against their specific techniques.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to have this dashboard drive decisions around what Red Team operations to conduct, what defensive capabilities to improve, and in general where we should be investing time and effort across our entire security division.</p>\n<p>We hope to consolidate our existing tools in this process and are currently evaluating solutions. We'll share more info when we've achieved some success here.</p>\n<h2>Key takeaways and how to get started</h2>\n<p>If you're looking to measure your Red Team's impact, here's what we've learned:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start tracking metrics early, even if they're not perfect.</li>\n<li>Focus on actionable metrics first (like adoption rate).</li>\n<li>Use your existing tools. We used GitLab and Tableau, but the approach works with any tracking system.</li>\n<li>Collaborate across security teams to leverage existing processes when possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We'd love to hear about your experience with metrics in security so drop a comment below or open an issue in one of our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/redteam/redteam-public\">public projects</a>.</p>\n<h2>Read more from GitLab's Red Team</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/11/20/stealth-operations-the-evolution-of-gitlabs-red-team/\">Stealth operations: The evolution of GitLab's Red Team</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/11/28/how-gitlabs-red-team-automates-c2-testing/\">How GitLab's Red Team automates C2 testing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/05/11/how-we-run-red-team-operations-remotely/\">How we run Red Team operations remotely</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>As companies rapidly adopt AI technologies, CISOs face a new frontier of security challenges. Many security leaders find themselves grappling with unfamiliar questions: How do we evaluate AI vendors differently from traditional software vendors? What security controls matter most? Where does vendor responsibility end and customer responsibility begin? How do we evaluate AI security risks within the context of the service provided? To help answer these questions, we’ve created the <a href=\"https://trust.gitlab.com/?itemUid=ad3d92c1-889e-49fc-b19c-2434f70071ee&amp;source=click\">GitLab AI Security Framework</a> to show security leaders how GitLab and customers enable secure AI-powered development using GitLab Duo.</p>\n<h2>The genesis of AI security challenges</h2>\n<p>From conversations with security leaders across industries a pattern has emerged: Organizations are rapidly embracing AI technologies to improve delivery while their security teams struggle to establish appropriate security controls.</p>\n<p>This disconnect isn't just a matter of resources or expertise – it represents a fundamental shift in how organizations need to approach security in the AI era. Security leaders are witnessing quick and unprecedented adoption of AI across their organizations, from development teams using coding assistants to marketing departments leveraging generative AI.</p>\n<p>While organizations are integrating AI within their own software, many of their current vendor-provided SaaS applications have added AI capabilities as well. Although this adoption drives innovation and efficiency, it also creates a complex set of security considerations that traditional frameworks weren't designed to address. Below are some of the specific challenges we’ve identified.</p>\n<h2>Security challenges in the AI era</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Responsibility and control uncertainty</strong></p>\n<p>The rapid pace of AI adoption has left many organizations without a coherent security governance strategy. Security teams find themselves trying to retrofit existing security frameworks to address AI-specific concerns. Security leaders face challenges in understanding where their responsibilities begin and end when it comes to AI security. The traditional vendor-customer relationship becomes more complex with AI systems, as data flows, model training, and inference processes create new types of interactions and dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Risk assessment evolution</strong></p>\n<p>Traditional security risk models struggle to capture the unique characteristics of AI systems. Security leaders are finding that standard risk assessment frameworks don't adequately address AI-specific risks. AI security risks will differ based on AI implementation and the context in which it’s used. The challenge is compounded by the need to evaluate AI vendors without necessarily having deep technical AI expertise on the security team.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Data protection complexities</strong><br />\nAI systems present unique challenges for data protection. The way these systems process, learn from, and generate data creates new privacy and security considerations that organizations should carefully evaluate. CISOs must ensure their data governance frameworks evolve to address how AI systems use and protect sensitive information. AI implementations with inadequate safeguards might inadvertently reveal protected information via AI generated outputs.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Compliance and standards navigation</strong><br />\nThe regulatory landscape for AI security is rapidly evolving, with new standards like ISO 42001 and others emerging alongside existing frameworks. Security leaders must navigate this complex environment while ensuring their AI implementations remain compliant with both current and anticipated regulations. This requires a delicate balance between enabling AI adoption and maintaining robust security controls that satisfy regulatory requirements.</p>\n<h2>Addressing these challenges</h2>\n<p>With the release of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>, we recognized these executive-level concerns and developed a comprehensive framework to help organizations navigate AI security in the context of our AI-powered DevSecOps platform. Our AI Security Framework provides details on our privacy-first implementation of AI to enable GitLab Duo, and how we validate the security of our AI vendors. A responsibility matrix is included to help security leaders manage their AI security responsibilities while enabling their organizations to innovate safely. We also compiled a selection of AI-specific security risks to keep in mind and highlighted how GitLab capabilities like <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/30/how-gitlab-uses-prompt-guardrails-to-help-protect-customers/\">prompt guardrails</a> can help in mitigating them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want a deeper look at our security controls?

This file tells GitLab how to build and deploy your site.</p>\n<p>Let's break down what each part does:</p>\n<p><strong>The script part</strong></p>\n<pre><code>script:\n  - mkdir .public\n  - cp -r * .public\n  - mv .public public\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a folder called <code>public</code> and copies all your website files into it. GitLab Pages uses this folder to serve your website by default, though you can <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/introduction/#customize-the-default-folder\">customize the publishing folder</a> if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>The only part</strong></p>\n<pre><code>only:\n  - main\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells GitLab to only update your website when changes are made to the main branch. This helps prevent accidental updates from experimental changes.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Watch the magic happen</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Commit all your changes.</li>\n<li>Go to <strong>Build &gt; Pipelines</strong> to watch your deployment.</li>\n<li>Wait for the pipeline to complete successfully (indicated by a green checkmark).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Pages tutorial - pipeline running for new page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3TWqK19gKq5HvjlEtRqHv5/dd79b1909720c1f923ba7eb48433da18/image6.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Pages tutorial - pipeline passed for new page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/45Ue4IruelSnpSAVomoaxk/411fe710e2d8c4c190d3edaa6df45ee6/image1.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Step 5: Access your website</h2>\n<p>Once the pipeline completes successfully, your website will be available at: <strong>https://[yourusername].gitlab.io/</strong> .</p>\n<p>You can find an overview of your deployed website and additional settings in your project's <strong>Deploy &gt; Pages</strong> section.

To use the simpler GitLab-provided domain (like <code>username.gitlab.io</code>), go to <strong>Deploy &gt; Pages</strong> and disable the \"Use unique domain\" option. While unique domains offer some technical advantages, like better asset path handling, you might prefer the cleaner URL structure for a personal website.</li>\n<li>If your pipeline fails, check that you're using <code>main</code> instead of <code>master</code> in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</li>\n<li>Ensure your group and project is public for GitLab Pages to work.</li>\n<li>If any jobs fail in your pipeline, you can check the job log for detailed error messages to help with troubleshooting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With GitLab Pages and this template, you can have a professional/personal website up and running in minutes. The template is clean, responsive, and easy to customize. As you grow professionally, you can easily update your site directly through GitLab.</p>\n<p>You can automate the deployment process by leveraging GitLab's CI/CD capabilities and focusing on creating great content.</p>\n<p>The best part?

Developers often spend a significant amount of time configuring their local environments with the right dependencies, tools, and settings. GitLab aims to solve this by providing a default devfile that enables you to create workspaces and to start developing quickly.</p>\n<h2>GitLab Workspaces</h2>\n<p>GitLab Workspaces provide isolated development environments for making changes to your GitLab projects without the complexity of setting up local dependencies. Workspaces ensure reproducible development setups, allowing developers to share their environment configurations effortlessly.</p>\n<p>By default, GitLab Workspaces are configured to use the GitLab VS Code fork and include the GitLab Workflow extension. To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/workspace/\">the GitLab Workspaces documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Understand devfiles</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/devfile-ecosystem\"><strong>devfile</strong></a> is a YAML-based declarative configuration file that defines a project's development environment. It specifies the necessary tools, languages, runtimes, and other components required for development.</p>\n<p>Previously, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/06/26/quick-start-guide-for-gitlab-workspaces/\">setting up a workspace</a> required a custom devfile at the root of the repository. For example, a <code>.devfile.yaml</code> file. A typical devfile looked like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"typical default devfile\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3m6D3KyMTaojCt34gDfBaw/0736f517d9288524f835debcc4f1e118/Screenshot_2025-02-26_at_8.15.58_AM.png\" /></p>\n<h2>GitLab default devfile</h2>\n<p>Starting in GitLab 17.9, a GitLab default devfile is available for all projects when creating a workspace.

The credentials accessible under this endpoint are limited to enterprise <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/enterprise_user/\">users</a>, and can be accessed by the top-level group owner of an enterprise organization. An example of the future API call would be:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">curl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: &lt;pat&gt;\" \"https://verified_domain.com/api/v4/groups/&lt;group_id&gt;/manage/personal_access_tokens\"           \n</code></pre>\n<h3>GitLab API</h3>\n<p>The GitLab API allows you to programmatically list and manage tokens within your organization. Key authentication-related endpoints support <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/rest/authentication.html\">various token types</a>), including personal, group, CI/CD tokens, and more. An example of using a personal access token to list all visible projects across GitLab for the authenticated user is:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">curl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: &lt;your_access_token&gt;\" \\\n     \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects\"\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Watch this video to learn how to make API calls to the GitLab API.</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\"video_container\"&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0LsMC3ZiXkA?si=vj871YH610jwQdFc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<h3>Finding where tokens are used</h3>\n<p>Customers can find where tokens are used in different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>under <strong>User Profile &gt; <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#view-the-time-at-and-ips-where-a-token-was-last-used\">Access Tokens</a></strong></li>\n<li>in credentials inventory</li>\n<li>in audit events</li>\n<li>via the API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information on token usage is updated every 10 minutes for <strong>last_used</strong> and every minute for <strong>last_used_ip</strong>.</p>\n<p>The ability to view IP addresses was introduced in GitLab 17.9, and is controlled by the <strong>:pat_ip</strong> feature flag. Follow these <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#view-the-time-at-and-ips-where-a-token-was-last-used\">steps to view the last time a token was used</a>, along with its last five distinct IP addresses.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Token management guide - personal access tokens settings\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/kVZTX9mQuKy9EKWJ9MVZL/0a1e6f925774129712b5738a7a188f66/image1.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Managing tokens in the GitLab UI and API</h2>\n<p>The following table includes videos detailing a few token creations in the UI and demonstrates their usage via the API.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tokens</th>\n<th>GitLab UI</th>\n<th>GitLab API</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Personal access token</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=3\">video</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/personal_access_tokens.html\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=43\">video</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Group access token</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html#group-access-tokens\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=120\">video</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/group_access_tokens.html\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=157\">video</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Project access token</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#project-access-tokens\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=254\">video</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_access_tokens.html\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=285\">video</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Token rotation and expiration management</h2>\n<p>Implementing token rotation and strict expiration policies reduces the risk of compromise and ensures compliance with security standards. Regular rotation and enforced expirations prevent stale credentials from becoming security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Previously, expired group and project access tokens were automatically deleted upon expiration, which made auditing and security reviews more challenging due to the lack of a record of inactive tokens. To address this, a <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/462217\">recent feature</a> introduced the retention of inactive group and project access token records in the UI for 30 days after they became inactive. This enhancement aims to allow teams to track token usage, expiration, and revocation for better compliance and monitoring.</p>\n<p>To be more proactive in your token rotation and expiration management, do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively rotate your tokens via the UI or API. If you use the latter, be mindful of the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/personal_access_tokens.html#automatic-reuse-detection\">automatic token reuse detection</a> security mechanism.</li>\n<li>Set an instance-wide <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.html#limit-the-lifetime-of-access-tokens\">maximum lifetime limit</a> for access tokens.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Token rotation API</h3>\n<p>Until GitLab 17.7, customers had to programmatically rotate access tokens with the API. Its counterpart is now available on the UI. Check out the video in the table below or follow the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#use-the-ui\">documentation</a> for guidance.</p>\n<h3>Token rotation snippets</h3>\n<p>The following table includes videos detailing the rotation of GitLab tokens.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Tokens</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Prerequisites</th>\n<th>GitLab UI</th>\n<th>GitLab API</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Personal access token</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Scope: api</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=76\">video</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/personal_access_tokens.html#rotate-a-personal-access-token\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=92\">video</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Group access token</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Scope: api and Role(s): owner</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html#create-a-group-access-token-using-ui\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=203\">video</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/group_access_tokens.html\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=214\">video</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Project access token</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Scope: api and Role(s): owner, maintainer</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#create-a-project-access-token\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=335\">video</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_access_tokens.html\">Documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v5Nj3Jy4vaI?t=349\">video</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Token management best practices</h2>\n<h3>Principle of least privilege</h3>\n<p>Mitigate risk by restricting assigned permissions to tokens required for their respective tasks. This allows you to proactively predict and troubleshoot points of failure in your systems. You can do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selecting the right token for the right job. See the flowchart.</li>\n<li>Assign only the required scopes when creating a token. For example, use read-only scopes for tokens with auditor-like jobs. See <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#roles\">roles</a>.</li>\n<li>Avoid granting administrative privileges unless specifically required.</li>\n<li>Enforce instance-wide default token <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.html#set-a-lifetime-1\">lifetimes</a>.</li>\n<li>Regularly review and audit token permissions to ensure they align with current operational needs.</li>\n<li>Revoke tokens once the task is complete.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Service accounts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/service_accounts.html\">Service accounts</a> ensure tokens are tied to non-human entities, separating them from individual user accounts and reducing dependency on specific users. Instead of using personal accounts to generate tokens for automation, create service accounts with limited scopes. Benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Usage of service account tokens in CI/CD pipelines to avoid disruptions caused by user account changes</li>\n<li>Programmatically automate rotation processes, as personal accounts remain unaffected</li>\n<li>Clearer monitoring and auditing trail of actions taken by service accounts</li>\n<li>Service accounts with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-service-account-personal-access-token-with-no-expiry-date\">no expiration</a> date</li>\n<li>Does not consume <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/service_accounts/#create-a-service-account\">a license seat</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab plans to release a new <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9965\">Service Accounts UI</a> as a counterpart to its <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/user_service_accounts.html#create-a-service-account-user\">API-based creation</a>, designed to simplify the management of service accounts and their associated tokens.

With GitLab’s unified data store, the more you use GitLab, the more context GitLab Duo Workflow has about your code, configurations, security findings, and deployment practices. The result: an increasingly powerful development experience that's tailored to your organization.</p>\n<h2>The promise and challenge of AI agents</h2>\n<p>Software has fundamentally changed the world, but only a tiny fraction of the world's population has the skills to build software today. Yet, these developers reach billions of people with smartphones and internet connections. Just imagine a world where <em>more</em> people can build, secure, and deliver production-ready software – there will be an explosion of innovation as more people can create software that impacts billions. <strong>Agentic AI will make that happen.</strong></p>\n<p>AI agents understand context, maintain knowledge of entire codebases, and actively collaborate on complex software projects across development, security, and operations. With AI agents, developers can create software at a scale previously unimaginable for individuals or even teams.</p>\n<p>But this shift raises important questions about visibility, control, and how AI will impact developers' work. Organizations need to ensure AI enhances their developers' capabilities while enabling them to maintain oversight of their development process. The key to success isn't just adopting AI – it's adopting it in a way that empowers developers while preserving security, compliance, and governance.</p>\n<h2>AI's success depends on your platform, not more add-on tools</h2>\n<p>When you're working with more developers, code, and potential security risks, adding separate tools for each new challenge only creates more complexity. Our most recent <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/the-source/platform/devops-teams-want-to-shake-off-diy-toolchains-a-platform-is-the-answer/\">DevSecOps Survey</a> shows just how serious this problem is: DevSecOps teams are juggling up to 14 different tools, with professionals spending up to 80% of their time on non-coding tasks. For AI to be truly effective, it also needs high-quality, unified data. That's hard to achieve with disparate tools.</p>\n<p><strong>The GitLab DevSecOps platform combined with GitLab AI agents</strong> brings everything together in a single data model that encapsulates source code, merge requests, epics, users, access rights, and more. The agents we're building use context about users and projects to standardize how teams work and automate the non-coding tasks that absorb developer time, such as scanning for security issues and enforcing compliance rules. When AI is built directly into the platform, these capabilities become even more powerful, turning AI agents into development partners while keeping you in control of how AI enhances the process.</p>\n<p><strong>This isn't a far-off future — it's what we're building right now with GitLab Duo Workflow.</strong></p>\n<p>&lt;div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1059060959?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"GitLab Duo Workflow, the future of secure agentic AI software development\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`</p>\n<h2>GitLab Duo Workflow: AI agents on the most comprehensive DevSecOps platform</h2>\n<p>Leveraging GitLab's end-to-end DevSecOps platform, GitLab Duo Workflow helps developers work at their highest potential. While AI coding assistants help with individual pieces of code, GitLab Duo Workflow will understand your entire development lifecycle – automating routine tasks so developers can focus on strategic innovation and creative problem-solving. As we develop GitLab Duo Workflow, here’s what it will be able to help teams achieve:</p>\n<h3>From slow project setup to a running start</h3>\n<p>Developers spend precious time configuring new projects, managing dependencies, and setting up basic infrastructure instead of building new features. With GitLab Duo Workflow, you can <strong>automate project bootstrapping directly in the IDE</strong>, providing the right configurations from the start so you can focus on innovation sooner.</p>\n<h3>From legacy code to modern applications</h3>\n<p>Modernizing legacy code is more than just updating syntax — it requires understanding dependencies, tests, CI/CD pipelines, and documentation. GitLab Duo Workflow helps <strong>modernize your codebase by handling code refactoring</strong> – from code to tests.</p>\n<h3>From context switching to flow state</h3>\n<p>Today, developers constantly switch between tools, docs, and codebases to solve problems. GitLab Duo Workflow will help <strong>resolve tasks with the full context of your codebase-related issues and merge requests</strong>, letting developers stay in their flow.</p>\n<h3>From stale docs to dynamic knowledge</h3>\n<p>Documentation becomes stale quickly, making codebases harder to understand and maintain.

      "summary": "<p>Hatch is DigitalOcean’s global program for startups, which provides startups with credits and discounts on computing resources so they can build and scale without worrying about costs. In 2024, Hatch significantly revamped the program to better support those building businesses in the artificial intelligence sector, providing AI/ML startups with discounts for <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets\">GPU Droplets</a> and free access to DigitalOcean’s premium support in addition to credits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://exh.ai/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ex-human</a>, a startup building empathetic generative AI solutions backed by A16Z GAMES’ SPEEDRUN accelerator, chose the Hatch program to help serve their customers with AI models—read on to hear about their experience with Hatch so far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"from-film-to-the-future\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#from-film-to-the-future\">From film to the future</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#from-film-to-the-future\"></a></h2>\n<p>Inspired by the characters Sam from <em>Her (2013)</em> and Joi from <em>Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</em>, Artem Rodichev, founder and CEO of Ex-human, sought to build a future where humans interact with digital humans and characters on a daily basis, taking the form of friends, mentors, lovers, and more. After a stint at Replika, Rodichev saw that humans were building deeper connections with their AI companions and wanted to create a solution that was both viable for consumers and businesses.</p>\n<p>Ex-human brings their AI characters to life through text, images, video, and audio with unlimited scalability and customizability that opens up possibilities for numerous use cases. Partnering with companies such as Grindr, who are using Ex-human’s technology to bring an AI wingman to life, this technology has the opportunity to help humans form stronger bonds in both physical and digital worlds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\">Innovation shouldn’t come at a high cost</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\"></a></h2>\n<p>Building AI technology requires large amounts of computing power, which can come at a high price, especially for a new business. Ex-human chose the Hatch program because it offers exclusive pricing for access to on-demand NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplets at <strong>$1.90/GPU/hour</strong>*. Despite the favorable cost, Ex-human finds that there are no tradeoffs with power and reliability, giving them a solution that works for their budget and delivers for their needs. Ex-human uses GPU Droplets to serve their LLMs so customers can take advantage of their technology’s power.</p>\n<p>“DigitalOcean’s GPU Droplets are great. 99% of the time, it [is] used for serving our LLMs. I don’t think we have any trouble with unavailability, network issues, or stuff like that with DigitalOcean. We found DigitalOcean to be more intuitive and simpler than working with AWS or Google Cloud. It’s simple, not expensive, and reliable.” – Artem Rodichev, Founder and CEO @ Ex-human</p>\n<p>GPU Droplets allow for users to build, train, and scale their AI/ML workloads with ease. Through the Hatch program, you can access vast amounts of computational power without having to break the bank.</p>\n<p>Hatch startups also receive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Up to $100,000 in compute credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three months free of one NVIDIA H100x8 GPU Droplet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complimentary premium support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GenAI usage with Hatch credits</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Note that GPU Droplet usage will not be covered by Hatch compute credits. This pricing is only eligible for startups who are a part of the Hatch program, only applies to on-demand NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplets, and is accurate as of 3/7/2025. Pricing is subject to change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"musings-from-the-founder\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#musings-from-the-founder\">Musings from the founder</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#musings-from-the-founder\"></a></h2>\n<p>As a founder, Rodichev uses his deep expertise in AI/ML to guide Ex-human’s business and vision. While leading product development, he works alongside a talented team handling engineering, marketing, sales, investor relations, and everything in between. It’s hard work, but it’s deeply rewarding.</p>\n<p>Rodichev: “My number one advice–don’t start a startup. [laughs] The number two advice–do it if that’s the only thing you can do. If you really have a chip on your shoulder, if you really want to change the world in a way that you see how the world will develop, if you really want to build this kind of feature and no one else can build it, go start a startup.”</p>\n<p>The simplicity and reliability of DigitalOcean’s products affords founders like Rodichev to focus on things outside of managing their product’s infrastructure so they can build the future at full speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in joining the Hatch program to grow your startup?

      "summary": "<p>Growing businesses need networking solutions that are simple, scalable, and reliable. Whether you’re managing high-traffic applications, optimizing cloud resources, or strengthening security, our latest networking updates are designed to make your cloud infrastructure more powerful and easier to manage. Today, we’re excited to announce three key networking enhancements: <strong>Network Load Balancer</strong>, <strong>IPv6 for Load Balancers</strong>, and <strong>Reserved IPv6 for Droplets</strong>. Let’s dive into how these updates can help you distribute traffic efficiently, ensure stability across deployments, and future-proof your networking stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"network-load-balancer-smarter-traffic-distribution-for-high-performance-apps\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#network-load-balancer-smarter-traffic-distribution-for-high-performance-apps\">Network Load Balancer: Smarter traffic distribution for high-performance apps</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#network-load-balancer-smarter-traffic-distribution-for-high-performance-apps\"></a></h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"Network Load Balancer\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/NLB-new.gif\" /><figcaption>Network Load Balancer</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When your application experiences a surge in users, every millisecond counts. Our new <strong>Network Load Balancer,</strong> now in public preview, is designed to handle high-traffic volumes with greater efficiency and resilience. Unlike our existing load balancer, which operates at the application layer (Layer 7), the Network Load Balancer works at the transport layer (Layer 4). This means lower latency, higher throughput, unmetered total number of connections, and better handling of real-time workloads like gaming, streaming, and chat applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Key benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ultra-low latency:</strong> Directs traffic at the IP/protocol level for faster response times.</li>\n<li><strong>Scalable volume management:</strong> Handles high request volumes with minimal overhead.</li>\n<li><strong>Unmetered connections:</strong> Handles up to  millions of connections and requests per second</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a simple setup and automatic failover, Network Load Balancer helps ensure your application stays responsive—even when traffic spikes unexpectedly</p>\n<h2 id=\"ipv6-support-for-internet-facing-regional-load-balancers-delivering-dependable-performance\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ipv6-support-for-internet-facing-regional-load-balancers-delivering-dependable-performance\">IPv6 support for internet-facing regional Load Balancers: Delivering dependable performance</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ipv6-support-for-internet-facing-regional-load-balancers-delivering-dependable-performance\"></a></h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"IPv6 for load balancers\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/lb-v6-new-2.gif\" /><figcaption>IPv6 for load balancers</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can now support IPv6 client connections by assigning IPv6 addresses to your internet-facing load balancers, and even dual-stack your external-facing regional load balancer that gets both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Any addresses you assign will persist throughout the lifetime of the load balancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IPv4 depletion:</strong> Less to worry about running out of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 support offers a larger address space than IPv4.</li>\n<li><strong>IPv6 client support:</strong> Dual stack your load balancers and support IPv6 clients without modifying your application stack.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global accessibility:</strong> IPv6 is designed to  support growth for businesses scaling internationally or with large distributed workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"reserved-ipv6-for-droplets-build-a-scalable-and-resilient-infrastructure\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#reserved-ipv6-for-droplets-build-a-scalable-and-resilient-infrastructure\">Reserved IPv6 for Droplets: Build a scalable and resilient infrastructure</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#reserved-ipv6-for-droplets-build-a-scalable-and-resilient-infrastructure\"></a></h2>\n<figure><img alt=\"Reserved IPv6 for Droplets\" src=\"https://networking.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/Reserved-IP.gif\" /><figcaption>Reserved IPv6 for Droplets</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For developers building scalable cloud environments, managing IP addresses should be effortless. With <strong>Reserved IPv6 for Droplets</strong>, now available for public preview, you can reserve, assign, unassign, and reassign IPv6 addresses across different Droplets or to a specific data center. Whether you’re migrating workloads, deploying blue-green updates, or ensuring continuity after scaling events, Reserved IPv6 gives you the flexibility to manage your network more efficiently.This feature is perfect for teams that need predictable networking while keeping infrastructure simple and cost-effective.</p>\n<p><strong>How it helps:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IP persistence:</strong> Retain IP addresses when upgrading or replacing Droplets.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved service continuity:</strong> Avoid disruptions during maintenance or scaling.</li>\n<li><strong>More control over your network:</strong> Assign IPv6 addresses based on workload needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"get-started-with-better-networking-today\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started-with-better-networking-today\">Get started with better networking today</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started-with-better-networking-today\"></a></h2>\n<p>These networking enhancements are now available to help you scale with confidence.

For our latest edition, we focused on how these growing businesses are adapting to the increased adoption of artificial intelligence. The rise of AI has created opportunities for individual developers and businesses, but integrating new tools and technologies is not without challenges, especially for those who are not large enterprises with teams dedicated to AI. This report, gathered responses from over 1,000 developers around the world, examines how widespread adoption of AI really is, what challenges developers face when it comes to AI adoption, how usage of AI tools differs based on company size and other factors, and what the biggest upcoming trends are.</p>\n<p>The findings reveal a significant growth opportunity, as 21% of organizations have yet to implement AI formally in any form. Despite this, there is clear interest in AI innovation: 66% of respondents are engaged in passion projects exploring AI, and 36% are actively investigating capabilities without having launched formal initiatives. For small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular, AI adoption could be a game-changer by allowing developers to take on multiple roles more easily—but they must first overcome key barriers, such as high Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) costs and lack of internal knowledge on how to best leverage these tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-findings\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#key-findings\">Key findings:</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#key-findings\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"ai-adoption-is-increasing-but-still-has-growth-potential\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-adoption-is-increasing-but-still-has-growth-potential\">AI adoption is increasing, but still has growth potential</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#ai-adoption-is-increasing-but-still-has-growth-potential\"></a></h3>\n<p>AI adoption has increased significantly over the past year—in November 2023, we found that 49% of respondents had used AI for business use, and a year later, 79% say their organization is integrating AI in some form. However, there is still clear room for more growth and maturity in organizations’ AI usage, as 32% say they are just starting to explore AI, and just 11% consider themselves an AI-driven business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cost-and-knowledge-are-barriers-for-entry-for-smes\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#cost-and-knowledge-are-barriers-for-entry-for-smes\">Cost and knowledge are barriers for entry for SMEs</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#cost-and-knowledge-are-barriers-for-entry-for-smes\"></a></h3>\n<p>The high upfront costs of GPUs are a challenge for 34% of businesses, along with the lack of knowledge around how to optimize GPUs. Smaller companies feel this more acutely, and sometimes struggle to justify investments in AI as they find it challenging to demonstrate a clear return on investment from these activities, and have a lack of dedicated in-house AI resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust-safety-and-integration-concerns\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#trust-safety-and-integration-concerns\">Trust, safety, and integration concerns</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#trust-safety-and-integration-concerns\"></a></h3>\n<p>Other challenges with adoption for AI include integrating AI into existing workflows and choosing the right AI model. Looking at the most urgent issues in the AI space today, 47% say reliance on unverified LLM data is a top concern, along with ensuring AI data is unbiased.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upcoming-trends-in-ai\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#upcoming-trends-in-ai\">Upcoming trends in AI</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#upcoming-trends-in-ai\"></a></h3>\n<p>While areas such as agentic AI are already growing quickly, we looked at what respondents feel is the next frontier of AI, and found that Advanced Multi Modal Systems, Real Time Audio Translation, and Automated Machine Learning are the next most compelling. Organizations currently are primarily using AI for improving internal processes and operations and enhancing their existing services with AI/ML.</p>\n<h2 id=\"read-the-report\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#read-the-report\">Read the report</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#read-the-report\"></a></h2>\n<p>These findings make it clear—accessible AI solutions are key to unlocking AI for businesses of all sizes, especially those without large teams dedicated to AI transformation. Affordable GPU compute and approachable AI tools will help alleviate the challenges many developers are currently facing when it comes to AI, and enable them to integrate AI solutions more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/currents/february-2025\">Currents webpage for the full report and graphs</a> and <a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sign up</a> to explore DigitalOcean’s Generative AI platform and GPU offerings.</p>",

A key focus of my role is developing engineering solutions that help new customers successfully integrate and get the most value from DigitalOcean’s platform. We provide technical assistance, ensure applications are ready for cloud deployment, and guide customers with best practices. We speak with so many customers that we have gathered a wealth of common wisdom about deploying applications in the cloud, and we are always willing and ready to share this information with any customer interested in joining DigitalOcean.</p>\n<div class=\"callout info\">\n<p><strong>🎥 Have a look at Vasily’s full conversation ⬇️</strong></p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gHMo47Jj_o\" target=\"_blank\">View YouTube video</a>\n\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"how-would-you-describe-the-pace-of-innovation-at-do\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-would-you-describe-the-pace-of-innovation-at-do\">How would you describe the pace of innovation at DO?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-would-you-describe-the-pace-of-innovation-at-do\"></a></h2>\n<p>When it comes to innovation, the thing I really like about working at DigitalOcean is that we are always at the edge of technology. We have these crazy waves of innovation like blockchain, and now it’s artificial intelligence and machine learning. All the customers that we talk to bring their use cases to DigitalOcean. At DigitalOcean, you will always work with the latest technology. I find this to be a great way for me to stay on the bleeding edge of technology in the industry, and I think that’s a huge advantage for anyone who joins DigitalOcean.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-customer-feedback-influence-product-development-at-digitalocean\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-does-customer-feedback-influence-product-development-at-digitalocean\">How does customer feedback influence product development at DigitalOcean?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-does-customer-feedback-influence-product-development-at-digitalocean\"></a></h2>\n<p>On top of helping customers onboard, we also act as a bridge between customers and the product teams. Our roadmap is customer-driven, so when we meet customers, we always ask about the highlights and lowlights of our products. When they share something, we make sure that we pass this feedback to the engineering teams, and then we can implement the features in the future. So, this path between customers, their feedback, and their emotions is translated and passed on to product engineering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-would-you-describe-the-culture-of-customer-centricity-at-digitalocean\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-would-you-describe-the-culture-of-customer-centricity-at-digitalocean\">How would you describe the culture of customer-centricity at DigitalOcean?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-would-you-describe-the-culture-of-customer-centricity-at-digitalocean\"></a></h2>\n<p>Our day-to-day job is to get on calls with customers and help them solve their issues. I think the most important quality of an engineer on this team is really being able to get into the shoes of a customer to understand them. We take the problem of a customer and treat it as our own problem to try to solve it for them. So this is what being customer-centric means to me —to show this empathy and help all the customers that we serve at DigitalOcean.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-value-do-you-resonate-with-the-most\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-do-value-do-you-resonate-with-the-most\">What DO value do you resonate with the most?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-do-value-do-you-resonate-with-the-most\"></a></h2>\n<p>Out of all the values we have here at DigitalOcean, one that stands out to me the most is <strong>DO Simple</strong>. DigitalOcean has built itself to be a very simple cloud. There are many other clouds all around, but you sometimes have to have a PhD to run your simple workload in their clouds. What we build and what we deliver to customers is all very simple. The builds, the products, and the configurations are all developed in a way to give customers maximum value with minimal complexity.</p>\n<p>For our customers, simplicity means that you don’t have to invest in a big DevOps team; you don’t have to invest a lot into learning some new technology. Instead, you can take the solution and start using it because it’s very simple. If you want to run Kubernetes at some point, good luck; that’s a steep learning curve. If you use the DigitalOcean App Platform, it offers the same benefit, but it’s much simpler. That’s why a lot of customers love our products.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dive-into-the-future-with-digitalocean\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#dive-into-the-future-with-digitalocean\">Dive into the future with DigitalOcean</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#dive-into-the-future-with-digitalocean\"></a></h2>\n<p>At DigitalOcean, our customers and community are at the heart of everything we do.
