      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes v1.34 is coming at the end of August 2025.\nThis release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements.\nHere are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle!</p>\n<p>Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1.34 development and may change before release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"featured-enhancements-of-kubernetes-v1-34\">Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.34</h2>\n<p>The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1.34 release,\nbut is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes.\nThis is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-core-of-dra-targets-stable\">The core of DRA targets stable</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/\">Dynamic Resource Allocation</a> (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize,\nrequest, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using <em>structured parameters</em> that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes.\nThe relevant enhancement proposal, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4381\">KEP-4381</a>, took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.\nDRA with structured parameters relies on a set of supporting API kinds: ResourceClaim, DeviceClass, ResourceClaimTemplate,\nand ResourceSlice API types under <code>resource.k8s.io</code>, while extending the <code>.spec</code> for Pods with a new <code>resourceClaims</code> field.\nThe core of DRA is targeting graduation to stable in Kubernetes v1.34.</p>\n<p>With DRA, device drivers and cluster admins define device classes that are available for use.\nWorkloads can claim devices from a device class within device requests.\nKubernetes allocates matching devices to specific claims and places the corresponding Pods on nodes that can access the allocated devices.\nThis framework provides flexible device filtering using CEL, centralized device categorization, and simplified Pod requests, among other benefits.</p>\n<p>Once this feature has graduated, the <code>resource.k8s.io/v1</code> APIs will be available by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"serviceaccount-tokens-for-image-pull-authentication\">ServiceAccount tokens for image pull authentication</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/\">ServiceAccount</a> token integration for <code>kubelet</code> credential providers is likely to reach beta and be enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.34.\nThis allows the <code>kubelet</code> to use these tokens when pulling container images from registries that require authentication.</p>\n<p>That support already exists as alpha, and is tracked as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4412\">KEP-4412</a>.</p>\n<p>The existing alpha integration allows the <code>kubelet</code> to use short-lived, automatically rotated ServiceAccount tokens (that follow OIDC-compliant semantics) to authenticate to a container image registry.\nEach token is scoped to one associated Pod; the overall mechanism replaces the need for long-lived image pull Secrets.</p>\n<p>Adopting this new approach reduces security risks, supports workload-level identity, and helps cut operational overhead.\nIt brings image pull authentication closer to modern, identity-aware good practice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-replacement-policy-for-deployments\">Pod replacement policy for Deployments</h3>\n<p>After a change to a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/\">Deployment</a>, terminating pods may stay up for a considerable amount of time and may consume additional resources.\nAs part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3973\">KEP-3973</a>, the <code>.spec.podReplacementPolicy</code> field will be introduced (as alpha) for Deployments.</p>\n<p>If your cluster has the feature enabled, you'll be able to select one of two policies:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>TerminationStarted</code></dt>\n<dd>Creates new pods as soon as old ones start terminating, resulting in faster rollouts at the cost of potentially higher resource consumption.</dd>\n<dt><code>TerminationComplete</code></dt>\n<dd>Waits until old pods fully terminate before creating new ones, resulting in slower rollouts but ensuring controlled resource consumption.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This feature makes Deployment behavior more predictable by letting you choose when new pods should be created during updates or scaling.\nIt's beneficial when working in clusters with tight resource constraints or with workloads with long termination periods.</p>\n<p>It's expected to be available as an alpha feature and can be enabled using the <code>DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy</code> and <code>DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas</code> feature gates in the API server and kube-controller-manager.</p>\n<h3 id=\"production-ready-tracing-for-kubelet-and-api-server\">Production-ready tracing for <code>kubelet</code> and API Server</h3>\n<p>To address the longstanding challenge of debugging node-level issues by correlating disconnected logs,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a> provides deep, contextual insights into the <code>kubelet</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature instruments critical <code>kubelet</code> operations, particularly its gRPC calls to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), using the vendor-agnostic OpenTelemetry standard.\nIt allows operators to visualize the entire lifecycle of events (for example: a Pod startup) to pinpoint sources of latency and errors.\nIts most powerful aspect is the propagation of trace context; the <code>kubelet</code> passes a trace ID with its requests to the container runtime, enabling runtimes to link their own spans.</p>\n<p>This effort is complemented by a parallel enhancement, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a>, which brings the same tracing capabilities to the Kubernetes API server.\nTogether, these enhancements provide a more unified, end-to-end view of events, simplifying the process of pinpointing latency and errors from the control plane down to the node.\nThese features have matured through the official Kubernetes release process.\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a> was introduced as an alpha feature in v1.25, while <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a> debuted as alpha in v1.22.\nBoth enhancements were promoted to beta together in the v1.27 release.\nLooking forward, Kubelet Tracing (<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a>) and API Server Tracing (<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a>) are now targeting graduation to stable in the upcoming v1.34 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prefersamezone-and-prefersamenode-traffic-distribution-for-services\"><code>PreferSameZone</code> and <code>PreferSameNode</code> traffic distribution for Services</h3>\n<p>The <code>spec.trafficDistribution</code> field within a Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/\">Service</a> allows users to express preferences for how traffic should be routed to Service endpoints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3015\">KEP-3015</a> deprecates <code>PreferClose</code> and introduces two additional values: <code>PreferSameZone</code> and <code>PreferSameNode</code>.\n<code>PreferSameZone</code> is equivalent to the current <code>PreferClose</code>.\n<code>PreferSameNode</code> prioritizes sending traffic to endpoints on the same node as the client.</p>\n<p>This feature was introduced in v1.33 behind the <code>PreferSameTrafficDistribution</code> feature gate.\nIt is targeting graduation to beta in v1.34 with its feature gate enabled by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-kyaml-a-kubernetes-dialect-of-yaml\">Support for KYAML: a Kubernetes dialect of YAML</h3>\n<p>KYAML aims to be a safer and less ambiguous YAML subset, and was designed specifically\nfor Kubernetes. Whatever version of Kubernetes you use, you'll be able use KYAML for writing manifests\nand/or Helm charts.\nYou can write KYAML and pass it as an input to <strong>any</strong> version of <code>kubectl</code>,\nbecause all KYAML files are also valid as YAML.\nWith kubectl v1.34, we expect you'll also be able to request KYAML output from <code>kubectl</code> (as in <code>kubectl get -o kyaml …</code>).\nIf you prefer, you can still request the output in JSON or YAML format.</p>\n<p>KYAML addresses specific challenges with both YAML and JSON.\nYAML's significant whitespace requires careful attention to indentation and nesting,\nwhile its optional string-quoting can lead to unexpected type coercion (for example: <a href=\"https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/\">&quot;The Norway Bug&quot;</a>).\nMeanwhile, JSON lacks comment support and has strict requirements for trailing commas and quoted keys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5295\">KEP-5295</a> introduces KYAML, which tries to address the most significant problems by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Always double-quoting value strings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leaving keys unquoted unless they are potentially ambiguous</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always using <code>{}</code> for mappings (associative arrays)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always using <code>[]</code> for lists</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This might sound a lot like JSON, because it is! But unlike JSON, KYAML supports comments, allows trailing commas, and doesn't require quoted keys.</p>\n<p>We're hoping to see KYAML introduced as a new output format for <code>kubectl</code> v1.34.\nAs with all these features, none of these changes are 100% confirmed; watch this space!</p>\n<p>As a format, KYAML is and will remain a <strong>strict subset of YAML</strong>, ensuring that any compliant YAML parser can parse KYAML documents.\nKubernetes does not require you to provide input specifically formatted as KYAML, and we have no plans to change that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fine-grained-autoscaling-control-with-hpa-configurable-tolerance\">Fine-grained autoscaling control with HPA configurable tolerance</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951</a> introduces a new feature that allows users to configure autoscaling tolerance on a per-HPA basis,\noverriding the default cluster-wide 10% tolerance setting that often proves too coarse-grained for diverse workloads.\nThe enhancement adds an optional <code>tolerance</code> field to the HPA's <code>spec.behavior.scaleUp</code> and <code>spec.behavior.scaleDown</code> sections,\nenabling different tolerance values for scale-up and scale-down operations,\nwhich is particularly valuable since scale-up responsiveness is typically more critical than scale-down speed for handling traffic surges.</p>\n<p>Released as alpha in Kubernetes v1.33 behind the <code>HPAConfigurableTolerance</code> feature gate, this feature is expected to graduate to beta in v1.34.\nThis improvement helps to address scaling challenges with large deployments, where for scaling in,\na 10% tolerance might mean leaving hundreds of unnecessary Pods running.\nUsing the new, more flexible approach would enable workload-specific optimization for both\nresponsive and conservative scaling behaviors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-know-more\">Want to know more?</h2>\n<p>New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes.\nWe will formally announce what's new in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md\">Kubernetes v1.34</a> as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes v1.34 release is planned for <strong>Wednesday 27th August 2025</strong>.

I'll explain what the (suprising) state of PQC in\nKubernetes is and what the implications are for current and future clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-post-quantum-cryptography\">What is Post-Quantum Cryptography</h2>\n<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to\nbe secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The primary\nconcern is that quantum computers, using algorithms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\">Shor's Algorithm</a>,\ncould efficiently break widely used public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and\nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which underpin much of today's secure\ncommunication, including TLS. The industry is actively working on standardizing\nand adopting PQC algorithms. One of the first to be standardized by <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\">NIST</a> is\nthe Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (<code>ML-KEM</code>), formerly known as\nKyber, and now standardized as <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.pdf\">FIPS-203</a> (PDF download).</p>\n<p>It is difficult to predict when quantum computers will be able to break\nclassical algorithms. However, it is clear that we need to start migrating to\nPQC algorithms now, as the next section shows. To get a feeling for the\npredicted timeline we can look at a <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf\">NIST report</a> covering the transition to\npost-quantum cryptography standards. It declares that system with classical\ncrypto should be deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timelines\">Key exchange vs. digital signatures: different needs, different timelines</h2>\n<p>In TLS, there are two main cryptographic operations we need to secure:</p>\n<p><strong>Key Exchange</strong>: This is how the client and server agree on a shared secret to\nencrypt their communication. If an attacker records encrypted traffic today,\nthey could decrypt it in the future, if they gain access to a quantum computer\ncapable of breaking the key exchange. This makes migrating KEMs to PQC an\nimmediate priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Signatures</strong>: These are primarily used to authenticate the server (and\nsometimes the client) via certificates. The authenticity of a server is\nverified at the time of connection. While important, the risk of an attack\ntoday is much lower, because the decision of trusting a server cannot be abused\nafter the fact. Additionally, current PQC signature schemes often come with\nsignificant computational overhead and larger key/signature sizes compared to\ntheir classical counterparts.</p>\n<p>Another significant hurdle in the migration to PQ certificates is the upgrade\nof root certificates. These certificates have long validity periods and are\ninstalled in many devices and operating systems as trust anchors.</p>\n<p>Given these differences, the focus for immediate PQC adoption in TLS has been\non hybrid key exchange mechanisms. These combine a classical algorithm (such as\nElliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)) with a PQC algorithm (such as\n<code>ML-KEM</code>). The resulting shared secret is secure as long as at least one of the\ncomponent algorithms remains unbroken. The <code>X25519MLKEM768</code> hybrid scheme is the\nmost widely supported one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-kems\">State of PQC key exchange mechanisms (KEMs) today</h2>\n<p>Support for PQC KEMs is rapidly improving across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Go</strong>: The Go standard library's <code>crypto/tls</code> package introduced support for\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code> in version 1.24 (released February 2025). Crucially, it's\nenabled by default when there is no explicit configuration, i.e.,\n<code>Config.CurvePreferences</code> is <code>nil</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Browsers &amp; OpenSSL</strong>: Major browsers like Chrome (version 131, November 2024)\nand Firefox (version 135, February 2025), as well as OpenSSL (version 3.5.0,\nApril 2025), have also added support for the <code>ML-KEM</code> based hybrid scheme.</p>\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-lb/122756\">rolling out support</a> for <code>X25519MLKEM768</code> in version\n26 of their operating systems. Given the proliferation of Apple devices, this\nwill have a significant impact on the global PQC adoption.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed overview of the state of PQC in the wider industry,\nsee <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/\">this blog post by Cloudflare</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-quantum-kems-in-kubernetes-an-unexpected-arrival\">Post-quantum KEMs in Kubernetes: an unexpected arrival</h2>\n<p>So, what does this mean for Kubernetes? Kubernetes components, including the\nAPI server and kubelet, are built with Go.</p>\n<p>As of Kubernetes v1.33, released in April 2025, the project uses Go 1.24. A\nquick check of the Kubernetes codebase reveals that <code>Config.CurvePreferences</code>\nis not explicitly set. This leads to a fascinating conclusion: Kubernetes\nv1.33, by virtue of using Go 1.24, supports hybrid post-quantum\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code> for TLS connections by default!</p>\n<p>You can test this yourself. If you set up a Minikube cluster running Kubernetes\nv1.33.0, you can connect to the API server using a recent OpenSSL client:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> minikube start --kubernetes-version<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>v1.33.0\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl cluster-info\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt;\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl config view --minify --raw -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\'</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">{</span>.clusters<span style=\"color: #666;\">[</span>0<span style=\"color: #666;\">]</span>.cluster.certificate-authority-data<span style=\"color: #666;\">}</span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\'</span> | base64 -d &gt; ca.crt\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> openssl version\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025 (Library: OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025)\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">echo</span> -n <span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"Q\"</span> | openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt; -CAfile ca.crt\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">[...]\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Negotiated TLS1.3 group: X25519MLKEM768\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">[...]\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">DONE\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lo and behold, the negotiated group is <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>! This is a significant\nstep towards making Kubernetes quantum-safe, seemingly without a major\nannouncement or dedicated KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-go-version-mismatch-pitfall\">The Go version mismatch pitfall</h2>\n<p>An interesting wrinkle emerged with Go versions 1.23 and 1.24. Go 1.23\nincluded experimental support for a draft version of <code>ML-KEM</code>, identified as\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>. This was also enabled by default if\n<code>Config.CurvePreferences</code> was <code>nil</code>. Kubernetes v1.32 used Go 1.23. However,\nGo 1.24 removed the draft support and replaced it with the standardized version\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.</p>\n<p>What happens if a client and server are using mismatched Go versions (one on\n1.23, the other on 1.24)? They won't have a common PQC KEM to negotiate, and\nthe handshake will fall back to classical ECC curves (e.g., <code>X25519</code>). How\ncould this happen in practice?</p>\n<p>Consider a scenario:</p>\n<p>A Kubernetes cluster is running v1.32 (using Go 1.23 and thus\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>). A developer upgrades their <code>kubectl</code> to v1.33,\ncompiled with Go 1.24, only supporting <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>. Now, when <code>kubectl</code>\ncommunicates with the v1.32 API server, they no longer share a common PQC\nalgorithm. The connection will downgrade to classical cryptography, silently\nlosing the PQC protection that has been in place. This highlights the\nimportance of understanding the implications of Go version upgrades, and the\ndetails of the TLS stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limitation-packet-size\">Limitations: packet size</h2>\n<p>One practical consideration with <code>ML-KEM</code> is the size of its public keys\nwith encoded key sizes of around 1.2 kilobytes for <code>ML-KEM-768</code>.\nThis can cause the initial TLS <code>ClientHello</code> message not to fit inside\na single TCP/IP packet, given the typical networking constraints\n(most commonly, the standard Ethernet frame size limit of 1500\nbytes). Some TLS libraries or network appliances might not handle this\ngracefully, assuming the Client Hello always fits in one packet. This issue\nhas been observed in some Kubernetes-related projects and networking\ncomponents, potentially leading to connection failures when PQC KEMs are used.\nMore details can be found at <a href=\"https://tldr.fail/\">tldr.fail</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-post-quantum-signatures\">State of Post-Quantum Signatures</h2>\n<p>While KEMs are seeing broader adoption, PQC digital signatures are further\nbehind in terms of widespread integration into standard toolchains. NIST has\npublished standards for PQC signatures, such as <code>ML-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-204</code>) and\n<code>SLH-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-205</code>). However, implementing these in a way that's broadly\nusable (e.g., for PQC Certificate Authorities) <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#the-algorithms\">presents challenges</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Larger Keys and Signatures</strong>: PQC signature schemes often have significantly\nlarger public keys and signature sizes compared to classical algorithms like\nEd25519 or RSA. For instance, Dilithium2 keys can be 30 times larger than\nEd25519 keys, and certificates can be 12 times larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Signing and verification operations <a href=\"https://pqshield.github.io/nist-sigs-zoo/\">can be substantially slower</a>.\nWhile some algorithms are on par with classical algorithms, others may have a\nmuch higher overhead, sometimes on the order of 10x to 1000x worse performance.\nTo improve this situation, NIST is running a\n<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/pqc-digital-signature-second-round-announcement\">second round of standardization</a> for PQC signatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Toolchain Support</strong>: Mainstream TLS libraries and CA software do not yet have\nmature, built-in support for these new signature algorithms. The Go team, for\nexample, has indicated that <code>ML-DSA</code> support is a high priority, but the\nsoonest it might appear in the standard library is Go 1.26 <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/64537#issuecomment-2877714729\">(as of May 2025)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/circl\">Cloudflare's CIRCL</a> (Cloudflare Interoperable Reusable Cryptographic Library)\nlibrary implements some PQC signature schemes like variants of Dilithium, and\nthey maintain a <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/go\">fork of Go (cfgo)</a> that integrates CIRCL. Using <code>cfgo</code>, it's\npossible to experiment with generating certificates signed with PQC algorithms\nlike Ed25519-Dilithium2. However, this requires using a custom Go toolchain and\nis not yet part of the mainstream Kubernetes or Go distributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The journey to a post-quantum secure Kubernetes is underway, and perhaps\nfurther along than many realize, thanks to the proactive adoption of <code>ML-KEM</code>\nin Go. With Kubernetes v1.33, users are already benefiting from hybrid post-quantum key\nexchange in many TLS connections by default.</p>\n<p>However, awareness of potential pitfalls, such as Go version mismatches leading\nto downgrades and issues with Client Hello packet sizes, is crucial. While PQC\nfor KEMs is becoming a reality, PQC for digital signatures and certificate\nhierarchies is still in earlier stages of development and adoption for\nmainstream use. As Kubernetes maintainers and contributors, staying informed\nabout these developments will be key to ensuring the long-term security of the\nplatform.</p>",

These\nworkloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can\nsignificantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As\nhighlighted in the 2024 <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/\">Llama\npaper</a>,\nhardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in\nAI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling\ndevices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by <a href=\"https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1i7kJ/all-your-gpus-are-belong-to-us-an-inside-look-at-nvidias-self-healing-geforce-now-infrastructure-ryan-hallisey-piotr-prokop-pl-nvidia\">Ryan Hallisey and Piotr\nProkop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA's Self-Healing\nGeForce NOW\nInfrastructure</a>\n(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLnHtKwmu2I\">recording</a>) as they see 19\nremediation requests per 1000 nodes a day!\nWe also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on\npower, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model.</p>\n<p>However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is\neither there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay\nthere fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial\nhardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead\nto a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-ai-ml-workloads\">Understanding AI/ML workloads</h3>\n<p>Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging\nscheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle. AI/ML workloads typically\nfall into two categories - training and inference. Here is an oversimplified\nview of those categories’ characteristics, which are different from traditional workloads\nlike web services:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Training</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are resource-intensive, often consuming entire\nmachines and running as gangs of pods. Training jobs are usually &quot;run to\ncompletion&quot; - but that could be days, weeks or even months. Any failure in a\nsingle pod can necessitate restarting the entire step across all the pods.</dd>\n<dt>Inference</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are usually long-running or run indefinitely,\nand can be small enough to consume a subset of a Node’s devices or large enough to span\nmultiple nodes. They often require downloading huge files with the model\nweights.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These workload types specifically break many past assumptions:</p>\n<table><caption style=\"display: none;\">Workload assumptions before and now</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Before</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Now</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Can get a better CPU and the app will work faster.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Require a <strong>specific</strong> device (or <strong>class of devices</strong>) to run.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">When something doesn’t work, just recreate it.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Allocation or reallocation is expensive.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Any node will work. No need to coordinate between Pods.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Scheduled in a special way - devices often connected in a cross-node topology.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Each Pod can be plug-and-play replaced if failed.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Pods are a part of a larger task. Lifecycle of an entire task depends on each Pod.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Container images are slim and easily available.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Container images may be so big that they require special handling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Long initialization can be offset by slow rollout.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Initialization may be long and should be optimized, sometimes across many Pods together.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Compute nodes are commoditized and relatively inexpensive, so some idle time is acceptable.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Nodes with specialized hardware can be an order of magnitude more expensive than those without, so idle time is very wasteful.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The existing failure model was relying on old assumptions. It may still work for\nthe new workload types, but it has limited knowledge about devices and is very\nexpensive for them. In some cases, even prohibitively expensive. You will see\nmore examples later in this article.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-kubernetes-still-reigns-supreme\">Why Kubernetes still reigns supreme</h3>\n<p>This article is not going deeper into the question: why not start fresh for<br />\nAI/ML workloads since they are so different from the traditional Kubernetes\nworkloads. Despite many challenges, Kubernetes remains the platform of choice\nfor AI/ML workloads. Its maturity, security, and rich ecosystem of tools make it\na compelling option. While alternatives exist, they often lack the years of\ndevelopment and refinement that Kubernetes offers. And the Kubernetes developers\nare actively addressing the gaps identified in this article and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-current-state-of-device-failure-handling\">The current state of device failure handling</h2>\n<p>This section outlines different failure modes and the best practices and DIY\n(Do-It-Yourself) solutions used today. The next session will describe a roadmap\nof improving things for those failure modes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>In order to understand the failures related to the Kubernetes infrastructure,\nyou need to understand how many moving parts are involved in scheduling a Pod on\nthe node. The sequence of events when the Pod is scheduled in the Node is as\nfollows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is scheduled on the Node</li>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is registered with the <em>kubelet</em> via local gRPC</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> uses <em>device plugin</em> to watch for devices and updates capacity of\nthe node</li>\n<li><em>Scheduler</em> places a <em>user Pod</em> on a Node based on the updated capacity</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> asks <em>Device plugin</em> to <strong>Allocate</strong> devices for a <em>User Pod</em></li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> creates a <em>User Pod</em> with the allocated devices attached to it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This diagram shows some of those actors involved:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The diagram shows relationships between the kubelet, Device plugin, and a user Pod. It shows that kubelet connects to the Device plugin named my-device, kubelet reports the node status with the my-device availability, and the user Pod requesting the 2 of my-device.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-devices.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>As there are so many actors interconnected, every one of them and every\nconnection may experience interruptions. This leads to many exceptional\nsituations that are often considered failures, and may cause serious workload\ninterruptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pods failing admission at various stages of its lifecycle</li>\n<li>Pods unable to run on perfectly fine hardware</li>\n<li>Scheduling taking unexpectedly long time</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The same diagram as one above it, however it has an overlayed orange bang drawings over individual components with the text indicating what can break in that component. Over the kubelet text reads: 'kubelet restart: looses all devices info before re-Watch'. Over the Device plugin text reads: 'device plugin update, evictIon, restart: kubelet cannot Allocate devices or loses all devices state'. Over the user Pod text reads: 'slow pod termination: devices are unavailable'.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-failures.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The goal for Kubernetes is to make the interruption between these components as\nreliable as possible. Kubelet already implements retries, grace periods, and\nother techniques to improve it. The roadmap section goes into details on other\nedge cases that the Kubernetes project tracks. However, all these improvements\nonly work when these best practices are followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure and restart kubelet and the container runtime (such as containerd or CRI-O)\nas early as possible to not interrupt the workload.</li>\n<li>Monitor device plugin health and carefully plan for upgrades.</li>\n<li>Do not overload the node with less-important workloads to prevent interruption\nof device plugin and other components.</li>\n<li>Configure user pods tolerations to handle node readiness flakes.</li>\n<li>Configure and code graceful termination logic carefully to not block devices\nfor too long.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another class of Kubernetes infra-related issues is driver-related. With\ntraditional resources like CPU and memory, no compatibility checks between the\napplication and hardware were needed. With special devices like hardware\naccelerators, there are new failure modes. Device drivers installed on the node:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must match the hardware</li>\n<li>Be compatible with an app</li>\n<li>Must work with other drivers (like <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl\">nccl</a>,\netc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best practices for handling driver versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor driver installer health</li>\n<li>Plan upgrades of infrastructure and Pods to match the version</li>\n<li>Have canary deployments whenever possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the best practices in this section and using device plugins and device\ndriver installers from trusted and reliable sources generally eliminate this\nclass of failures. Kubernetes is tracking work to make this space even better.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-failed\">Failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>There is very little handling of device failure in Kubernetes today. Device\nplugins report the device failure only by changing the count of allocatable\ndevices. And Kubernetes relies on standard mechanisms like liveness probes or\ncontainer failures to allow Pods to communicate the failure condition to the\nkubelet. However, Kubernetes does not correlate device failures with container\ncrashes and does not offer any mitigation beyond restarting the container while\nbeing attached to the same device.</p>\n<p>This is why many plugins and DIY solutions exist to handle device failures based\non various signals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-controller\">Health controller</h4>\n<p>In many cases a failed device will result in unrecoverable and very expensive\nnodes doing nothing. A simple DIY solution is a <em>node health controller</em>. The\ncontroller could compare the device allocatable count with the capacity and if\nthe capacity is greater, it starts a timer. Once the timer reaches a threshold,\nthe health controller kills and recreates a node.</p>\n<p>There are problems with the <em>health controller</em> approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root cause of the device failure is typically not known</li>\n<li>The controller is not workload aware</li>\n<li>Failed device might not be in use and you want to keep other devices running</li>\n<li>The detection may be too slow as it is very generic</li>\n<li>The node may be part of a bigger set of nodes and simply cannot be deleted in\nisolation without other nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are variations of the health controller solving some of the problems\nabove. The overall theme here though is that to best handle failed devices, you\nneed customized handling for the specific workload. Kubernetes doesn’t yet offer\nenough abstraction to express how critical the device is for a node, for the\ncluster, and for the Pod it is assigned to.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pod-failure-policy\">Pod failure policy</h4>\n<p>Another DIY approach for device failure handling is a per-pod reaction on a\nfailed device. This approach is applicable for <em>training</em> workloads that are\nimplemented as Jobs.</p>\n<p>Pod can define special error codes for device failures. For example, whenever\nunexpected device behavior is encountered, Pod exits with a special exit code.\nThen the Pod failure policy can handle the device failure in a special way. Read\nmore on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-failure-policy\">Handling retriable and non-retriable pod failures with Pod failure\npolicy</a></p>\n<p>There are some problems with the <em>Pod failure policy</em> approach for Jobs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no well-known <em>device failed</em> condition, so this approach does not work for the\ngeneric Pod case</li>\n<li>Error codes must be coded carefully and in some cases are hard to guarantee.</li>\n<li>Only works with Jobs with <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>, due to the limitation of a pod\nfailure policy feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, this solution has limited applicability.</p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-pod-watcher\">Custom pod watcher</h4>\n<p>A little more generic approach is to implement the Pod watcher as a DIY solution\nor use some third party tools offering this functionality. The pod watcher is\nmost often used to handle device failures for inference workloads.</p>\n<p>Since Kubernetes just keeps a pod assigned to a device, even if the device is\nreportedly unhealthy, the idea is to detect this situation with the pod watcher\nand apply some remediation. It often involves obtaining device health status and\nits mapping to the Pod using Pod Resources API on the node. If a device fails,\nit can then delete the attached Pod as a remediation. The replica set will\nhandle the Pod recreation on a healthy device.</p>\n<p>The other reasons to implement this watcher:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Without it, the Pod will keep being assigned to the failed device forever.</li>\n<li>There is no <em>descheduling</em> for a pod with <code>restartPolicy=Always</code>.</li>\n<li>There are no built-in controllers that delete Pods in CrashLoopBackoff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Problems with the <em>custom pod watcher</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The signal for the pod watcher is expensive to get, and involves some\nprivileged actions.</li>\n<li>It is a custom solution and it assumes the importance of a device for a Pod.</li>\n<li>The pod watcher relies on external controllers to reschedule a Pod.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are more variations of DIY solutions for handling device failures or\nupcoming maintenance. Overall, Kubernetes has enough extension points to\nimplement these solutions. However, some extension points require higher\nprivilege than users may be comfortable with or are too disruptive. The roadmap\nsection goes into more details on specific improvements in handling the device\nfailures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>When the container code fails or something bad happens with it, like out of\nmemory conditions, Kubernetes knows how to handle those cases. There is either\nthe restart of a container, or a crash of a Pod if it has <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>\nand scheduling it on another node. Kubernetes has limited expressiveness on what\nis a failure (for example, non-zero exit code or liveness probe failure) and how\nto react on such a failure (mostly either Always restart or immediately fail the\nPod).</p>\n<p>This level of expressiveness is often not enough for the complicated AI/ML\nworkloads. AI/ML pods are better rescheduled locally or even in-place as that\nwould save on image pulling time and device allocation. AI/ML pods are often\ninterconnected and need to be restarted together. This adds another level of\ncomplexity and optimizing it often brings major savings in running AI/ML\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>There are various DIY solutions to handle Pod failures orchestration. The most\ntypical one is to wrap a main executable in a container by some orchestrator.\nAnd this orchestrator will be able to restart the main executable whenever the\njob needs to be restarted because some other pod has failed.</p>\n<p>Solutions like this are very fragile and elaborate. They are often worth the\nmoney saved comparing to a regular JobSet delete/recreate cycle when used in\nlarge training jobs. Making these solutions less fragile and more streamlined\nby developing new hooks and extension points in Kubernetes will make it\neasy to apply to smaller jobs, benefiting everybody.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-degradation\">Failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>Not all device failures are terminal for the overall workload or batch job.\nAs the hardware stack gets more and more\ncomplex, misconfiguration on one of the hardware stack layers, or driver\nfailures, may result in devices that are functional, but lagging on performance.\nOne device that is lagging behind can slow down the whole training job.</p>\n<p>We see reports of such cases more and more often. Kubernetes has no way to\nexpress this type of failures today and since it is the newest type of failure\nmode, there is not much of a best practice offered by hardware vendors for\ndetection and third party tooling for remediation of these situations.</p>\n<p>Typically, these failures are detected based on observed workload\ncharacteristics. For example, the expected speed of AI/ML training steps on\nparticular hardware. Remediation for those issues is highly depend on a workload needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As outlined in a section above, Kubernetes offers a lot of extension points\nwhich are used to implement various DIY solutions. The space of AI/ML is\ndeveloping very fast, with changing requirements and usage patterns. SIG Node is\ntaking a measured approach of enabling more extension points to implement the\nworkload-specific scenarios over introduction of new semantics to support\nspecific scenarios. This means prioritizing making information about failures\nreadily available over implementing automatic remediations for those failures\nthat might only be suitable for a subset of workloads.</p>\n<p>This approach ensures there are no drastic changes for workload handling which\nmay break existing, well-oiled DIY solutions or experiences with the existing\nmore traditional workloads.</p>\n<p>Many error handling techniques used today work for AI/ML, but are very\nexpensive. SIG Node will invest in extension points to make those cheaper, with\nthe understanding that the price cutting for AI/ML is critical.</p>\n<p>The following is the set of specific investments we envision for various failure\nmodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Roadmap for failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>The area of Kubernetes infrastructure is the easiest to understand and very\nimportant to make right for the upcoming transition from Device Plugins to DRA.\nSIG Node is tracking many work items in this area, most notably the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127460\">integrate kubelet with the systemd watchdog · Issue\n#127460</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128696\">DRA: detect stale DRA plugin sockets · Issue\n#128696</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127803\">Support takeover for devicemanager/device-plugin · Issue\n#127803</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127457\">Kubelet plugin registration reliability · Issue\n#127457</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128167\">Recreate the Device Manager gRPC server if failed · Issue\n#128167</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128043\">Retry pod admission on device plugin grpc failures · Issue\n#128043</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, every interaction of Kubernetes components must be reliable via\neither the kubelet improvements or the best practices in plugins development\nand deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>For the device failures some patterns are already emerging in common scenarios\nthat Kubernetes can support. However, the very first step is to make information\nabout failed devices available easier. The very first step here is the work in\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4680\">KEP 4680</a> (Add Resource Health Status to the Pod Status for\nDevice Plugin and DRA).</p>\n<p>Longer term ideas include to be tested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate device failures into Pod Failure Policy.</li>\n<li>Node-local retry policies, enabling pod failure policies for Pods with\nrestartPolicy=OnFailure and possibly beyond that.</li>\n<li>Ability to <em>deschedule</em> pod, including with the <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>, so it can\nget a new device allocated.</li>\n<li>Add device health to the ResourceSlice used to represent devices in DRA,\nrather than simply withdrawing an unhealthy device from the ResourceSlice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>The main improvements to handle container code failures for AI/ML workloads are\nall targeting cheaper error handling and recovery. The cheapness is mostly\ncoming from reuse of pre-allocated resources as much as possible. From reusing\nthe Pods by restarting containers in-place, to node local restart of containers\ninstead of rescheduling whenever possible, to snapshotting support, and\nre-scheduling prioritizing the same node to save on image pulls.</p>\n<p>Consider this scenario: A big training job needs 512 Pods to run. And one of the\npods failed. It means that all Pods need to be interrupted and synced up to\nrestart the failed step. The most efficient way to achieve this generally is to\nreuse as many Pods as possible by restarting them in-place, while replacing the\nfailed pod to clear up the error from it. Like demonstrated in this picture:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The picture shows 512 pod, most ot them are green and have a recycle sign next to them indicating that they can be reused, and one Pod drawn in red, and a new green replacement Pod next to it indicating that it needs to be replaced.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/inplace-pod-restarts.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>It is possible to implement this scenario, but all solutions implementing it are\nfragile due to lack of certain extension points in Kubernetes. Adding these\nextension points to implement this scenario is on the Kubernetes roadmap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-degradation\">Roadmap for failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>There is very little done in this area - there is no clear detection signal,\nvery limited troubleshooting tooling, and no built-in semantics to express the\n&quot;degraded&quot; device on Kubernetes. There has been discussion of adding data on\ndevice performance or degradation in the ResourceSlice used by DRA to represent\ndevices, but it is not yet clearly defined. There are also projects like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator\">node-healthcheck-operator</a>\nthat can be used for some scenarios.</p>\n<p>We expect developments in this area from hardware vendors and cloud providers, and we expect to see mostly DIY\nsolutions in the near future. As more users get exposed to AI/ML workloads, this\nis a space needing feedback on patterns used here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-the-conversation\">Join the conversation</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes community encourages feedback and participation in shaping the\nfuture of device failure handling.

      "summary": "<p>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence.\nIt is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.\nDespite the existence of the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.\nThe need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">NFD</a> is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">hardware and system features</a> of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-image-compatibility-specification\">The need for image compatibility specification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies-between-containers-and-host-os\">Dependencies between containers and host OS</h3>\n<p>A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drivers</strong>:\nHost driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries or Software</strong>:\nThe container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Modules or Features</strong>:\nSpecific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO</li>\n<li>And more…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud-challenges\">Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges</h3>\n<p>Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.\nOften those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.\nFor instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RHCOS/RHEL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Photon OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Container-Optimized OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Azure Linux OS</strong></li>\n<li>And more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.\nIt must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-compatibility-initiative\">Image compatibility initiative</h3>\n<p>An effort was made within the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility\">Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility</a> working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.\nA specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.\nThe specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.\nIt aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-node-feature-discovery\">Implementation in Node Feature Discovery</h3>\n<p>The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> API.\nThis interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-specification\">Compatibility specification</h3>\n<p>The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing <em><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">Node Feature Groups</a></em>.\nThese objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.\nThe feature requirements are described by using <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">the list of available features</a> from the NFD project.\nThe schema has the following structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>version</strong> (string) - Specifies the API version.</li>\n<li><strong>compatibilities</strong> (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rules</strong> (object) - Specifies <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> to define image requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>weight</strong> (int, optional) - Node affinity weight.</li>\n<li><strong>tag</strong> (string, optional) - Categorization tag.</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong> (string, optional) - Short description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example might look like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options.</p>\n<p>On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/27204752526611-Feature-limitations-on-the-free-version-of-Slack\">feature limitations of free Slack</a>. The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations.</p>\n<p>Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md#what-actions-do-channel-owners-and-user-group-members-need-to-take-soon\">take some actions</a> to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The CNCF Projects Staff have proposed that our community look at migrating to Discord. Because of existing issues where we have been pushing the limits of Slack, they have already explored what a Kubernetes Discord would look like. Discord would allow us to implement new tools and integrations which would help the community, such as GitHub group membership synchronization. The Steering Committee will discuss and decide on our future platform.</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md\">FAQ</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/\">kubernetes-dev mailing list</a> and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C9T0QMNG4\">#announcements channel</a> for further news.

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge-with-kubernetes-events\">The challenge with Kubernetes events</h2>\n<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute</li>\n<li><strong>Retention</strong>: Default event retention is limited to one hour</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Related events from different components are not automatically linked</li>\n<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Events lack standardized severity or category classifications</li>\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: Similar events are not automatically grouped</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/\">Event</a> API reference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-world-value\">Real-World value</h2>\n<p>Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional event aggregation process:</strong> Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>With its event aggregation in its custom events:</strong> The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours.</p>\n<p>The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by detecting patterns early.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-an-event-aggregation-system\">Building an Event aggregation system</h2>\n<p>This post explores how to build a custom event aggregation system that addresses these challenges, aligned to Kubernetes best practices. I've picked the Go programming language for my example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-overview\">Architecture overview</h3>\n<p>This event aggregation system consists of three main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Event Watcher</strong>: Monitors the Kubernetes API for new events</li>\n<li><strong>Event Processor</strong>: Processes, categorizes, and correlates events</li>\n<li><strong>Storage Backend</strong>: Stores processed events for longer retention</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's a sketch for how to implement the event watcher:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #a2f;

      "summary": "<p>Modern generative AI and large language model (LLM) services create unique traffic-routing challenges\non Kubernetes. Unlike typical short-lived, stateless web requests, LLM inference sessions are often\nlong-running, resource-intensive, and partially stateful. For example, a single GPU-backed model server\nmay keep multiple inference sessions active and maintain in-memory token caches.</p>\n<p>Traditional load balancers focused on HTTP path or round-robin lack the specialized capabilities needed\nfor these workloads. They also don’t account for model identity or request criticality (e.g., interactive\nchat vs. batch jobs). Organizations often patch together ad-hoc solutions, but a standardized approach\nis missing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gateway-api-inference-extension\">Gateway API Inference Extension</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> was created to address\nthis gap by building on the existing <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API</a>, adding inference-specific\nrouting capabilities while retaining the familiar model of Gateways and HTTPRoutes. By adding an inference\nextension to your existing gateway, you effectively transform it into an <strong>Inference Gateway</strong>, enabling you to\nself-host GenAI/LLMs with a “model-as-a-service” mindset.</p>\n<p>The project’s goal is to improve and standardize routing to inference workloads across the ecosystem. Key\nobjectives include enabling model-aware routing, supporting per-request criticalities, facilitating safe model\nroll-outs, and optimizing load balancing based on real-time model metrics. By achieving these, the project aims\nto reduce latency and improve accelerator (GPU) utilization for AI workloads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The design introduces two new Custom Resources (CRDs) with distinct responsibilities, each aligning with a\nspecific user persona in the AI/ML serving workflow​:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Resource Model\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-resource-model.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencepool/\">InferencePool</a>\nDefines a pool of pods (model servers) running on shared compute (e.g., GPU nodes). The platform admin can\nconfigure how these pods are deployed, scaled, and balanced. An InferencePool ensures consistent resource\nusage and enforces platform-wide policies. An InferencePool is similar to a Service but specialized for AI/ML\nserving needs and aware of the model-serving protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/inferencemodel/\">InferenceModel</a>\nA user-facing model endpoint managed by AI/ML owners. It maps a public name (e.g., &quot;gpt-4-chat&quot;) to the actual\nmodel within an InferencePool. This lets workload owners specify which models (and optional fine-tuning) they\nwant served, plus a traffic-splitting or prioritization policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the InferenceModel API lets AI/ML owners manage what is served, while the InferencePool lets platform\noperators manage where and how it’s served.</p>\n<h2 id=\"request-flow\">Request flow</h2>\n<p>The flow of a request builds on the Gateway API model (Gateways and HTTPRoutes) with one or more extra inference-aware\nsteps (extensions) in the middle. Here’s a high-level example of the request flow with the\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/#endpoint-selection-extension\">Endpoint Selection Extension (ESE)</a>:</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Request Flow\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-request-flow.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gateway Routing</strong><br />\nA client sends a request (e.g., an HTTP POST to /completions). The Gateway (like Envoy) examines the HTTPRoute\nand identifies the matching InferencePool backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Endpoint Selection</strong><br />\nInstead of simply forwarding to any available pod, the Gateway consults an inference-specific routing extension—\nthe Endpoint Selection Extension—to pick the best of the available pods. This extension examines live pod metrics\n(queue lengths, memory usage, loaded adapters) to choose the ideal pod for the request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inference-Aware Scheduling</strong><br />\nThe chosen pod is the one that can handle the request with the lowest latency or highest efficiency, given the\nuser’s criticality or resource needs. The Gateway then forwards traffic to that specific pod.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Endpoint Extension Scheduling\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-epp-scheduling.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>This extra step provides a smarter, model-aware routing mechanism that still feels like a normal single request to\nthe client. Additionally, the design is extensible—any Inference Gateway can be enhanced with additional inference-specific\nextensions to handle new routing strategies, advanced scheduling logic, or specialized hardware needs. As the project\ncontinues to grow, contributors are encouraged to develop new extensions that are fully compatible with the same underlying\nGateway API model, further expanding the possibilities for efficient and intelligent GenAI/LLM routing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benchmarks\">Benchmarks</h2>\n<p>We evaluated ​this extension against a standard Kubernetes Service for a <a href=\"https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/\">vLLM</a>‐based model\nserving deployment. The test environment consisted of multiple H100 (80 GB) GPU pods running vLLM (<a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/01/27/v1-alpha-release.html\">version 1</a>)\non a Kubernetes cluster, with 10 Llama2 model replicas. The <a href=\"https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/inference-benchmark\">Latency Profile Generator (LPG)</a>\ntool was used to generate traffic and measure throughput, latency, and other metrics. The\n<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/resolve/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json\">ShareGPT</a>\ndataset served as the workload, and traffic was ramped from 100 Queries per Second (QPS) up to 1000 QPS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-results\">Key results</h3>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"Endpoint Extension Scheduling\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/inference-extension-benchmark.png\" />\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Comparable Throughput</strong>: Throughout the tested QPS range, the ESE delivered throughput roughly on par with a standard\nKubernetes Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lower Latency</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Per‐Output‐Token Latency</strong>: The ​ESE showed significantly lower p90 latency at higher QPS (500+), indicating that\nits model-aware routing decisions reduce queueing and resource contention as GPU memory approaches saturation.</li>\n<li><strong>Overall p90 Latency</strong>: Similar trends emerged, with the ​ESE reducing end‐to‐end tail latencies compared to the\nbaseline, particularly as traffic increased beyond 400–500 QPS.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These results suggest that this extension's model‐aware routing significantly reduced latency for GPU‐backed LLM\nworkloads. By dynamically selecting the least‐loaded or best‐performing model server, it avoids hotspots that can\nappear when using traditional load balancing methods for large, long‐running inference requests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As the Gateway API Inference Extension heads toward GA, planned features include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prefix-cache aware load balancing</strong> for remote caches</li>\n<li><strong>LoRA adapter pipelines</strong> for automated rollout</li>\n<li><strong>Fairness and priority</strong> between workloads in the same criticality band</li>\n<li><strong>HPA support</strong> for scaling based on aggregate, per-model metrics</li>\n<li><strong>Support for large multi-modal inputs/outputs</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Additional model types</strong> (e.g., diffusion models)</li>\n<li><strong>Heterogeneous accelerators</strong> (serving on multiple accelerator types with latency- and cost-aware load balancing)</li>\n<li><strong>Disaggregated serving</strong> for independently scaling pools</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>By aligning model serving with Kubernetes-native tooling, Gateway API Inference Extension aims to simplify\nand standardize how AI/ML traffic is routed. With model-aware routing, criticality-based prioritization, and\nmore, it helps ops teams deliver the right LLM services to the right users—smoothly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to learn more?</strong> Visit the <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">project docs</a> to dive deeper,\ngive an Inference Gateway extension a try with a few <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">simple steps</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/contributing/\">get involved</a> if you’re interested in\ncontributing to the project!</p>",

If you define Kubernetes-native sidecars, those are terminated <strong>after</strong> the main application. Furthermore, when used with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Jobs</a>, a sidecar container should still be alive and could potentially even restart after the owning Job is complete; Kubernetes-native sidecar containers do not block pod completion.</p>\n<p>To learn more, you can also read the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/configuration/pod-sidecar-containers/\">Pod sidecar containers tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>Now you know that defining a sidecar with this native approach will always start it before the main application. From the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/537a602195efdc04cdf2cb0368792afad082d9fd/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L827-L830\">kubelet source code</a>, it's visible that this often means being started almost in parallel, and this is not always what an engineer wants to achieve. What I'm really interested in is whether I can delay the start of the main application until the sidecar is not just started, but fully running and ready to serve.\nIt might be a bit tricky because the problem with sidecars is there’s no obvious success signal, contrary to init containers - designed to run only for a specified period of time. With an init container, exit status 0 is unambiguously &quot;I succeeded&quot;. With a sidecar, there are lots of points at which you can say &quot;a thing is running&quot;.\nStarting one container only after the previous one is ready is part of a graceful deployment strategy, ensuring proper sequencing and stability during startup. It’s also actually how I’d expect sidecar containers to work as well, to cover the scenario where the main application is dependent on the sidecar. For example, it may happen that an app errors out if the sidecar isn’t available to serve requests (e.g., logging with DataDog). Sure, one could change the application code (and it would actually be the “best practice” solution), but sometimes they can’t - and this post focuses on this use case.</p>\n<p>I'll explain some ways that you might try, and show you what approaches will really work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readiness-probe\">Readiness probe</h2>\n<p>To check whether Kubernetes native sidecar delays the start of the main application until the sidecar is ready, let’s simulate a short investigation. Firstly, I’ll simulate a sidecar container which will never be ready by implementing a readiness probe which will never succeed. As a reminder, a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">readiness probe</a> checks if the container is ready to start accepting traffic and therefore, if the pod can be used as a backend for services.</p>\n<p>(Unlike standard init containers, sidecar containers can have <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">probes</a> so that the kubelet can supervise the sidecar and intervene if there are problems. For example, restarting a sidecar container if it fails a health check.)</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

It will delay the start of the main container until the command is successfully executed (returns <code>0</code> exit status). If you’re wondering why I’ve added it to my <code>initContainer</code>, let’s analyse what happens If I’d added it to myapp container.

Nevertheless, the main application is not restarted nor influenced at all, even though I'm aware that (in our imaginary worst-case scenario) it can error out when the sidecar is not there serving requests.\nWhat if I’d used a <code>livenessProbe</code> without lifecycle <code>postStart</code>? Both containers will be immediately ready: at the beginning, this behavior will not be different from the one without any additional probes since the liveness probe doesn’t affect readiness at all. After a while, the sidecar will begin to restart itself, but it won’t influence the main container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findings-summary\">Findings summary</h2>\n<p>I’ll summarize the startup behavior in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Probe/Hook</th>\n<th>Sidecar starts before the main app?</th>\n<th>Main app waits for the sidecar to be ready?</th>\n<th>What if the check doesn’t pass?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>readinessProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is not ready; main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>livenessProbe</code></td>\n<td>Yes, but it’s almost in parallel (effectively <strong>no</strong>)</td>\n<td><strong>No</strong></td>\n<td>Sidecar is restarted, main app continues running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>startupProbe</code></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>postStart</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, main app container starts after <code>postStart</code> completes</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong>, but you have to provide custom logic for that</td>\n<td>Main app is not started</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To summarize: with sidecars often being a dependency of the main application, you may want to delay the start of the latter until the sidecar is healthy.\nThe ideal pattern is to start both containers simultaneously and have the app container logic delay at all levels, but it’s not always possible. If that's what you need, you have to use the right kind of customization to the Pod definition. Thankfully, it’s nice and quick, and you have the recipe ready above.</p>\n<p>Happy deploying!</p>",

We are\nalso pleased to announce that there are already a number of conformant\nimplementations to try, made possible by postponing this blog\nannouncement. Version 1.3.0 of the API was released about a month ago on\nApril 24, 2025.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.3.0 brings a new feature to the <em>Standard</em> channel\n(Gateway API's GA release channel): <em>percentage-based request mirroring</em>, and\nintroduces three new experimental features: cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)\nfilters, a standardized mechanism for listener and gateway merging, and retry\nbudgets.</p>\n<p>Also see the full\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-CHANGELOG.md\">release notes</a>\nand applaud the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/54df0a899c1c5c845dd3a80f05dcfdf65576f03c/CHANGELOG/1.3-TEAM.md\">v1.3.0 release team</a>\nnext time you see them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduation-to-standard-channel\">Graduation to Standard channel</h2>\n<p>Graduation to the Standard channel is a notable achievement for Gateway API\nfeatures, as inclusion in the Standard release channel denotes a high level of\nconfidence in the API surface and provides guarantees of backward compatibility.\nOf course, as with any other Kubernetes API, Standard channel features can continue\nto evolve with backward-compatible additions over time, and we (SIG Network)\ncertainly expect\nfurther refinements and improvements in the future. For more information on how\nall of this works, refer to the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/versioning/\">Gateway API Versioning Policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"percentage-based-request-mirroring\">Percentage-based request mirroring</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/LiorLieberman\">Lior Lieberman</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/jakebennert\">Jake Bennert</a></p>\n<p>GEP-3171: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-3171/index.md\">Percentage-Based Request Mirroring</a></p>\n<p><em>Percentage-based request mirroring</em> is an enhancement to the\nexisting support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-request-mirroring/\">HTTP request mirroring</a>, which allows HTTP requests to be duplicated to another backend using the\nRequestMirror filter type. Request mirroring is particularly useful in\nblue-green deployment. It can be used to assess the impact of request scaling on\napplication performance without impacting responses to clients.</p>\n<p>The previous mirroring capability worked on all the requests to a <code>backendRef</code>.<br />\nPercentage-based request mirroring allows users to specify a subset of requests\nthey want to be mirrored, either by percentage or fraction. This can be\nparticularly useful when services are receiving a large volume of requests.\nInstead of mirroring all of those requests, this new feature can be used to\nmirror a smaller subset of them.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with 42% of the requests to &quot;foo-v1&quot; being mirrored to &quot;foo-v2&quot;:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Please note: the experimental channel may include features that are\nchanged or removed later.</p>\n<p>Starting in release v1.3.0, in an effort to distinguish Experimental channel\nresources from Standard channel resources, any new experimental API kinds have the\nprefix &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;. For the same reason, experimental resources are now added to the\nAPI group <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> instead of <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code>.\nBear in mind that using new experimental channel resources means they can coexist\nwith standard channel resources, but migrating these resources to the standard\nchannel will require recreating them with the standard channel names and API\ngroup (both of which lack the &quot;x-k8s&quot; designator or &quot;X&quot; prefix).</p>\n<p>The v1.3 release introduces two new experimental API kinds: XBackendTrafficPolicy\nand XListenerSet. To be able to use experimental API kinds, you need to install\nthe Experimental channel Gateway API YAMLs from the locations listed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cors-filtering\">CORS filtering</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/liangli\">Liang Li</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/EyalPazz\">Eyal Pazz</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/robscott\">Rob Scott</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1767: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/geps/gep-1767/index.md\">CORS Filter</a></p>\n<p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows\na web page to access restricted resources from a server on an origin (domain,\nscheme, or port) different from the domain that served the web page.

In\naddition, it expands upon the existing suggestion that Gateway API implementations\nmay merge configuration from multiple Gateway objects. It also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds a new field <code>allowedListeners</code> to the <code>.spec</code> of a Gateway. The\n<code>allowedListeners</code> field defines from which Namespaces to select XListenerSets\nthat are allowed to attach to that Gateway: Same, All, None, or Selector based.</li>\n<li>increases the previous maximum number (64) of listeners with the addition of\nXListenerSets.</li>\n<li>allows the delegation of listener configuration, such as TLS, to applications in\nother namespaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be able to use experimental XListenerSet, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xlistenersets.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XListenerSet yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a Gateway with an HTTP listener and two child HTTPS\nXListenerSets with unique hostnames and certificates. The combined set of listeners\nattached to the Gateway includes the two additional HTTPS listeners in the\nXListenerSets that attach to the Gateway. This example illustrates the\ndelegation of listener TLS config to application owners in different namespaces\n(&quot;store&quot; and &quot;app&quot;). The HTTPRoute has both the Gateway listener named &quot;foo&quot; and\none XListenerSet listener named &quot;second&quot; as <code>parentRefs</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

The development of this specification changed the existing\nexperimental API kind BackendLBPolicy into a new experimental API kind,\nXBackendTrafficPolicy, in the interest of reducing the proliferation of policy\nresources that had commonalities.</p>\n<p>To be able to use experimental retry budgets, you need to install the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/config/crd/experimental/gateway.networking.x-k8s.io_xbackendtrafficpolicies.yaml\">Experimental channel Gateway API XBackendTrafficPolicy yaml</a>.</p>\n<p>The following example shows an XBackendTrafficPolicy that applies a\n<code>retryConstraint</code> that represents a budget that limits the retries to a maximum\nof 20% of requests, over a duration of 10 seconds, and to a minimum of 3 retries\nover 1 second.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>XBackendTrafficPolicy<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>traffic-policy-example<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">retryConstraint</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">budget</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">percent</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">20</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">interval</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>10s<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">minRetryRate</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">count</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">3</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">interval</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>1s<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>...<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of\nKubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API.

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/16/kubernetes-v1-33-in-place-pod-resize-beta/",
      "published": "Fri, 16 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the <strong>in-place Pod resize</strong> feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to <strong>Beta</strong> and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-place-pod-resize\">What is in-place Pod resize?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts.</p>\n<p>In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a <em>running</em> Pod, often without requiring a container restart.</p>\n<p>Here's the core idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>spec.containers[*].resources</code> field in a Pod specification now represents the <em>desired</em> resources and is mutable for CPU and memory.</li>\n<li>The <code>status.containerStatuses[*].resources</code> field reflects the <em>actual</em> resources currently configured on a running container.</li>\n<li>You can trigger a resize by updating the desired resources in the Pod spec via the new <code>resize</code> subresource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try it out on a v1.33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires <code>kubectl</code> v1.32+):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl edit pod &lt;pod-name&gt; --subresource resize\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation:\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-in-place-pod-resize-matter\">Why does in-place Pod resize matter?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Disruption:</strong> Stateful applications, long-running batch jobs, and sensitive workloads can have their resources adjusted without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a Pod restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Resource Utilization:</strong> Scale down over-provisioned Pods without disruption, freeing up resources in the cluster. Conversely, provide more resources to Pods under heavy load without needing a restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Scaling:</strong> Address transient resource needs more quickly. For example Java applications often need more CPU during startup than during steady-state operation. Start with higher CPU and resize down later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-changed-between-alpha-and-beta\">What's changed between Alpha and Beta?</h2>\n<p>Since the alpha release in v1.27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-user-facing-changes\">Notable user-facing changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>resize</code> Subresource:</strong> Modifying Pod resources must now be done via the Pod's <code>resize</code> subresource (<code>kubectl patch pod &lt;name&gt; --subresource resize ...</code>). <code>kubectl</code> versions v1.32+ support this argument.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize Status via Conditions:</strong> The old <code>status.resize</code> field is deprecated. The status of a resize operation is now exposed via two Pod conditions:\n<ul>\n<li><code>PodResizePending</code>: Indicates the Kubelet cannot grant the resize immediately (e.g., <code>reason: Deferred</code> if temporarily unable, <code>reason: Infeasible</code> if impossible on the node).</li>\n<li><code>PodResizeInProgress</code>: Indicates the resize is accepted and being applied. Errors encountered during this phase are now reported in this condition's message with <code>reason: Error</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sidecar Support:</strong> Resizing <a class=\"glossary-tooltip\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"An auxilliary container that stays running throughout the lifecycle of a Pod.\">sidecar containers</a> in-place is now supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stability-and-reliability-enhancements\">Stability and reliability enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refined Allocated Resources Management:</strong> The allocation management logic with the Kubelet was significantly reworked, making it more consistent and robust. The changes eliminated whole classes of bugs, and greatly improved the reliability of in-place Pod resize.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Checkpointing &amp; State Tracking:</strong> A more robust system for tracking &quot;allocated&quot; and &quot;actuated&quot; resources was implemented, using new checkpoint files (<code>allocated_pods_state</code>, <code>actuated_pods_state</code>) to reliably manage resize state across Kubelet restarts and handle edge cases where runtime-reported resources differ from requested ones. Several bugs related to checkpointing and state restoration were fixed. Checkpointing efficiency was also improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Resize Detection:</strong> Enhancements to the Kubelet's Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) allow the Kubelet to respond to and complete resizes much more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced CRI Integration:</strong> A new <code>UpdatePodSandboxResources</code> CRI call was added to better inform runtimes and plugins (like NRI) about Pod-level resource changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Numerous Bug Fixes:</strong> Addressed issues related to systemd cgroup drivers, handling of containers without limits, CPU minimum share calculations, container restart backoffs, error propagation, test stability, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn't stop here! Here's what the community is focusing on next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stability and Productionization:</strong> Continued focus on hardening the feature, improving performance, and ensuring it is robust for production environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Addressing Limitations:</strong> Working towards relaxing some of the current limitations noted in the documentation, such as allowing memory limit decreases.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-vertically\">VerticalPodAutoscaler</a> (VPA) Integration:</strong> Work to enable VPA to leverage in-place Pod resize is already underway. A new <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> update mode will allow it to attempt non-disruptive resizes first, or fall back to recreation if needed. This will allow users to benefit from VPA's recommendations with significantly less disruption.</li>\n<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Gathering feedback from users adopting the beta feature is crucial for prioritizing further enhancements and addressing any uncovered issues or bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-and-providing-feedback\">Getting started and providing feedback</h2>\n<p>With the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature gate enabled by default in v1.33, you can start experimenting with in-place Pod resizing right away!</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">documentation</a> for detailed guides and examples.</p>\n<p>As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable. Please report any issues or share your experiences via the standard Kubernetes communication channels (GitHub issues, mailing lists, Slack). You can also review the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1287-in-place-update-pod-resources\">KEP-1287: In-place Update of Pod Resources</a> for the full in-depth design details.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing how the community leverages in-place Pod resize to build more efficient and resilient applications on Kubernetes!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Migrating GitLab groups and projects by direct transfer is now generally available from GitLab 18.3. This brings an easy-to-use and automated way of migrating GitLab resources between GitLab instances to an even broader audience.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/\">direct transfer</a> enables you to easily create a copy of chosen GitLab resources on the same or another GitLab instance. You can use either the UI or API. The UI is intuitive and straightforward, while <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/bulk_imports.html\">the API</a> gives you additional flexibility in terms of choosing resources to be copied.</p>\n<p>Migrating by direct transfer is a major improvement from <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html#migrate-projects-by-uploading-an-export-file\">migrating groups and projects using file exports</a> because of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't need to manually export each individual group and project to a file and then import all those export files to a new location. Now, you can directly migrate any top-level group you have the Owner role for with all its sub-groups and projects.</li>\n<li>It allows for <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/streamline-migrations-with-user-contribution-and-membership-mapping/\">post-import user contribution mapping</a> (such as issue or comment authorship), which gives you greater flexibility and control.</li>\n<li>It works reliably with large projects. Thanks to resource batching and concurrent execution of import and export processes the chance of interruption or timeout is significantly lowered.</li>\n<li>It offers better insights into the migration while it runs as well as after it completes. In the UI you can observe as the numbers grow as more items are imported. Then you can <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/direct_transfer_migrations/#review-results-of-the-import\">review the results</a>. You can see that an item was imported thanks to an <code>Imported</code> badge on items in the GitLab UI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ve come a long way since GitLab 14.3 when we started supporting the direct migration of the group resources. In GitLab 15.8, we <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/01/18/try-out-new-way-to-migrate-projects/\">extended this functionality to projects as a beta</a>. Since then, we have worked to improve the efficiency and reliability of importing, especially for large projects. We thoroughly reviewed the feature from a security and instance stability standpoint.</p>\n<p>To give an example of the sizes of the groups and projects we've tested with, and their import duration, we've seen successful imports of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100 projects (19.9k issues, 83k merge requests, 100k+ pipelines) that migrated in 8 hours</li>\n<li>1,926 projects (22k issues, 160k merge requests, 1.1 million pipelines) that migrated in 34 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On GitLab.com, migrating by direct transfer is enabled by default. On GitLab Self-Managed and on GitLab Dedicated, an administrator must <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/import_and_export_settings.html#enable-migration-of-groups-and-projects-by-direct-transfer\">enable the feature in application settings</a>.</p>\n<h2>When to use migrating by direct transfer and how to get the best results</h2>\n<p>Migrating by direct transfer requires network connection between instances or GitLab.com. Therefore, customers that use air-gapped networks with no connectivity between their GitLab instances still have to use file exports to copy their GitLab data. They will be able to use migrating groups and projects by direct transfer after we extend this solution to also <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8985\">support offline instances</a>.</p>\n<p>Before you attempt a migration, review <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/\">documentation</a>, including <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/direct_transfer_migrations/#prerequisites\">prerequisites</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrated-group-items\">group items</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrated-project-items\">project items</a> that are migrated. Some items are excluded from migration or not yet supported.</p>\n<h3>Migrate between most recent possible versions</h3>\n<p>We recommend migrating between versions that are as recent as possible. Update the source and destination instances to take advantage of all improvements and bug fixes we’ve added over time.</p>\n<h3>Prepare for user contribution mapping post migration</h3>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/import/#user-contribution-and-membership-mapping\">user contribution and membership mapping process</a> so you know what to expect after migration completes and what are the next steps for you to take.</p>\n<h3>Review options to reduce migration duration</h3>\n<p>Depending on where you’re migrating to, GitLab.com, a self-managed instance, or Dedicated, you can employ <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#reducing-migration-duration\">various strategies to reduce the migration duration</a>.</p>\n<h2>How can I review the results?</h2>\n<p>You can view all groups and projects migrated by you by direct transfer listed on the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/import/direct_transfer_migrations/#group-import-history\">group import history page</a>. For each group and project, you can view statistics for imported items and dig down into details in case some items were not imported. Alternatively, you can use <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/bulk_imports.html#list-all-group-or-project-migrations-entities\">API endpoints</a> to do the same.</p>\n<p>In cases where most of your projects completed successfully but one or two end up missing some relations, like merge requests or issues, we recommend that you try re-importing those projects <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/bulk_imports.html#start-a-new-group-or-project-migration\">by using the API</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753961409/ja8agmwarwxxlo9vmqbo.gif\" /></p>\n<h2>What’s next for migrating by direct transfer?</h2>\n<p>We are excited to bring migration by direct transfer to general availability and hope you are too!

      "published": "2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>An observation is a compliance finding or deficiency identified during control monitoring. This is essentially a gap between what your security controls should be doing and what they're actually doing. Observations can stem from design deficiencies where the control isn't structured properly to meet requirements, operating effectiveness issues where the control exists but isn't working as intended, or evidence gaps where required documentation or proof of control execution is missing.</p>\n<p>These observations emerge from our quarterly control monitoring process, where we systematically assess the effectiveness of security controls supporting our certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.). Observations can also be the output of our external audits from third-party assessors. Observations aren't just compliance checkboxes, they represent real security risks that need prompt, visible remediation.</p>\n<p>Observation management is the process by which we manage these observations from identification through remediation to closure. In this article, you'll learn how the GitLab Security Team uses the DevSecOps platform to manage and remediate observations, and the efficiencies we've realized from doing so.</p>\n<h2>The GitLab observation lifecycle: From identification to resolution</h2>\n<p>The lifecycle of an observation encompasses the entire process from initial identification by compliance engineers through to completed remediation by remediation owners. This lifecycle enables real-time transparent status reporting and that is easier for all stakeholders to understand and follow.</p>\n<p>Here are the stages of the observation lifecycle:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Identification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance engineers identify potential observations during quarterly monitoring.</li>\n<li>Initial validation occurs to confirm the finding represents a genuine control gap.</li>\n<li>Detailed documentation begins immediately in a GitLab issue.</li>\n<li>The root cause of the observation is determined and a remediation plan to address the root cause is established.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Validation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue is assigned to the appropriate remediation owner (usually a team lead or department manager).</li>\n<li>Remediation owner reviews and confirms they understand and accept ownership.</li>\n<li>The remediation plan is reviewed, prioritized, and updated collaboratively as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. In-progress</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Active remediation work begins with clear milestones and deadlines.</li>\n<li>Regular updates are provided through GitLab comments and status changes.</li>\n<li>Collaboration happens transparently where all stakeholders can see progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Remediated</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remediation owner marks work complete and provides evidence.</li>\n<li>Issue transitions to compliance review for validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Resolution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compliance engineer verifies exit criteria are met.</li>\n<li>The issue is closed with final documentation.</li>\n<li>Lessons learned are captured for future prevention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Alternative paths</strong> handle blocked work, risk acceptance decisions, and stalled remediation efforts with appropriate escalation workflows.\n<img alt=\"Example of observation lifecycle\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753301753/pbvheikwpivuvhzd5ith.png\" />\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Example of observation lifecycle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h2>The power of transparency in GitLab</h2>\n<p>Effective observation management shouldn't require detective work to determine basic information like ownership, status, or priority. Yet most organizations find themselves exactly in this scenario: compliance teams chasing updates, operational teams unaware of their responsibilities, and leadership lacking visibility into real risk exposure until audit season arrives.</p>\n<p>The Security Compliance team at GitLab faced these exact problems. Our team initially used a dedicated GRC tool as the single source of truth for outstanding observations, but the lack of visibility to key stakeholders meant minimal remediation actually occurred. The team found themselves spending their time on administrative work, rather than guiding remediation efforts.</p>\n<p>Our solution was to move observation management directly into GitLab issues within a dedicated project. This approach transforms observations from compliance issues into visible, actionable work items that integrate naturally into development and operations workflows. Every stakeholder can see what needs attention, collaborate on remediation plans, and track progress in real time, creating the transparency and accountability that traditional tools simply can't deliver.</p>\n<h3>Smart organization through labels and issue boards</h3>\n<p>GitLab allows teams to categorize observation issues into multiple organizational views. The Security Compliance team uses the following to categorize observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Workflow:</strong> <code>~workflow::identified</code>, <code>~workflow::validated</code>, <code>~workflow::in progress</code>, <code>~workflow::remediated</code></li>\n<li><strong>Department:</strong> <code>~dept::engineering</code>, <code>~dept::security</code>, <code>~dept::product</code></li>\n<li><strong>Risk Severity:</strong> <code>~risk::critical</code>, <code>~risk::high</code>, <code>~risk::medium</code>, <code>~risk::low</code></li>\n<li><strong>System:</strong> <code>~system::gitlab</code>, <code>~system::gcp</code>, <code>~system::hr-systems</code></li>\n<li><strong>Program:</strong> <code>~program::soc2</code>, <code>~program::iso</code>, <code>~program::fedramp</code> , <code>~program::pci</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These labels are then leveraged to create issue boards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Workflow boards</strong> visualize the observation lifecycle stages.</li>\n<li><strong>Department boards</strong> show each team's remediation workload.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk-based boards</strong> prioritize critical findings requiring immediate attention.</li>\n<li><strong>System boards</strong> visualize observations by system.</li>\n<li><strong>Program boards</strong> track certification-specific observation resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Labels enable powerful filtering and reporting while supporting automated workflows through our triage bot policies. Please refer to the automation section for more details on our automation strategy.</p>\n<h2>Automation: Working smarter, not harder</h2>\n<p>Managing dozens of observations across multiple certifications requires smart automation. The Security Compliance team utilizes the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage\">triage bot</a>, which is an open source project hosted in GitLab. The triage bot gem aims to enable project managers to automatically triage issues in GitLab projects or groups based on defined policies. This helps manage issue hygiene so stakeholders can focus their efforts on remediation.</p>\n<p>Within the observation management project, we have policies written to ensure there is an assignee on each issue, each issue has required labels, issues are updated every 30 days, and blocked and stalled issues are nudged every 90 days. In addition, a weekly summary issue is created to summarize all the issues out of compliance based on our defined policies. This enables team members to monitor issues efficiently and spend less time on administrative tasks.</p>\n<h2>Measuring success: Key metrics and reporting</h2>\n<p>GitLab's raw issue data can be leveraged into actionable intelligence. Organizations can extract meaningful insights from issue creation date, closed date, last updated date, and labels. The following metrics provide a comprehensive view of your observation management effectiveness:</p>\n<p><strong>Resolution Efficiency Analysis:</strong> Average time from identification to resolution by department and severity</p>\n<p>Track issue creation versus close dates across departments and severity levels to identify bottlenecks and measure performance against SLAs. This reveals which teams excel at rapid response and which may need additional resources or process improvements.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Risk Assessment:</strong> Current risk profile based on open critical and high risk observations</p>\n<p>Leverage risk level labels to create dynamic visualizations of your organization's current risk exposure. This provides leadership with an immediate understanding of critical observations requiring urgent attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategic Resource Allocation:</strong> Department-level risk distribution for targeted improvement efforts</p>\n<p>Identify which departments are responsible for remediation of the highest-risk observations to prioritize resources, oversight, and projects. This data-driven approach ensures improvement efforts focus where they'll have maximum impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance Readiness Monitoring:</strong> Certification-specific observation counts and resolution rates</p>\n<p>Utilize certification labels to assess audit preparedness and track progress toward compliance goals. This metric provides early warning of potential certification risks and validates remediation efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Accountability Tracking:</strong> Overdue remediations</p>\n<p>Monitor SLA compliance to ensure observations receive timely attention. This metric highlights systemic delays and enables proactive intervention before minor issues become major problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Engagement Health Check:</strong> Observation freshness</p>\n<p>Track recent activity (updates within 30 days) to ensure observations remain actively managed rather than forgotten. This metric identifies stagnant issues that may require escalation or reassignment.</p>\n<h2>Advanced strategies: Taking observation management further</h2>\n<p>Here's what you can do to deepen the impact of observation management in your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrate with security tools</strong></p>\n<p>Modern observation management extends beyond manual tracking by connecting with your existing security infrastructure. Organizations can configure vulnerability scanners and security monitoring tools to automatically generate observation issues, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Apply predictive analytics</strong></p>\n<p>Historical observation data becomes a powerful forecasting tool when properly analyzed. Organizations can leverage past remediation patterns to predict future timelines and resource requirements, enabling more accurate project planning and budget allocation. Pattern recognition in observation types reveals systemic vulnerabilities that warrant preventive controls, shifting focus from reactive to proactive risk management. Advanced implementations incorporate multiple data sources into sophisticated risk scoring algorithms that provide nuanced threat assessments and priority rankings.</p>\n<p><strong>Customize for stakeholders</strong></p>\n<p>Effective observation management recognizes that different roles require different perspectives on the same data. Role-based dashboards deliver tailored views for executives seeking high-level risk summaries, department managers tracking team performance, and individual contributors managing their assigned observations. Automated reporting systems can be configured to match various audience needs and communication preferences, from detailed technical reports to executive briefings. Self-service analytics capabilities empower stakeholders to conduct ad-hoc analysis and generate custom insights without requiring technical expertise or support.</p>\n<h2>Move from mere compliance to operational excellence</h2>\n<p>GitLab's approach to observation management represents more than a tool change, it's a fundamental shift from reactive compliance to proactive risk mitigation. By breaking down silos between compliance teams and operational stakeholders, organizations achieve unprecedented visibility while dramatically improving remediation outcomes.</p>\n<p>The results are measurable: faster resolution through transparent accountability, active stakeholder collaboration instead of reluctant participation, and continuous audit readiness rather than periodic scrambles. Automated workflows free compliance professionals for strategic work while rich data enables predictive analytics that shift focus from reactive firefighting to proactive prevention.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, this approach elevates compliance from burden to strategic enabler. When observations become visible, trackable work items integrated into operational workflows, organizations develop stronger security culture and lasting improvements that extend beyond any single audit cycle. The outcome isn't just regulatory compliance. It's organizational resilience and competitive advantage through superior risk management.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want to learn more about GitLab's security compliance practices?

      "summary": "<p>Ask most development teams about supply chain security, and you'll get answers focused on vulnerability scanning or dependency management. While these are components of supply chain security, they represent a dangerously narrow view of a much broader challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Supply chain security isn't just about scanning dependencies.</strong> It encompasses the entire journey from code creation to production deployment, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source security:</strong> protect code repositories, managing contributor access, ensuring code integrity</li>\n<li><strong>Build security:</strong> secure build environments, preventing tampering during compilation and packaging</li>\n<li><strong>Artifact security:</strong> ensure the integrity of containers, packages, and deployment artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment security:</strong> secure the delivery mechanisms and runtime environments</li>\n<li><strong>Tool security:</strong> harden the development tools and platforms themselves</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The &quot;chain&quot; in supply chain security refers to this interconnected series of steps. A weakness anywhere in the chain can compromise the entire software delivery process.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security\">2020 SolarWinds attack</a> illustrates this perfectly. In what became one of the largest supply chain attacks in history, state-sponsored attackers compromised the build pipeline of SolarWinds' Orion network management software. Rather than exploiting a vulnerable dependency or hacking the final application, they injected malicious code during the compilation process itself.</p>\n<p>The result was devastating: More than 18,000 organizations, including multiple U.S. government agencies, unknowingly installed backdoored software through normal software updates. The source code was clean, the final application appeared legitimate, but the build process had been weaponized. This attack remained undetected for months, demonstrating how supply chain vulnerabilities can bypass traditional security measures.</p>\n<h3>Common misconceptions that leave organizations vulnerable</h3>\n<p>Despite growing awareness of supply chain threats, many organizations remain exposed because they operate under fundamental misunderstandings about what software supply chain security actually entails. These misconceptions create dangerous blind spots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thinking software supply chain security equals dependency scanning</li>\n<li>Focusing only on open source components while ignoring proprietary code risks</li>\n<li>Believing that code signing alone provides sufficient protection</li>\n<li>Assuming that secure coding practices eliminate supply chain risks</li>\n<li>Treating it as a security team problem rather than a development workflow challenge</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Software supply chain security dependency chart\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753200077/kqndvlxyvncshdiq0xea.png\" /></p>\n<h2>How AI is changing the game</h2>\n<p>Just as organizations are grappling with traditional software supply chain security challenges, artificial intelligence (AI)  is introducing entirely new attack vectors and amplifying existing ones in unprecedented ways.</p>\n<h3>AI-powered attacks: More sophisticated, more scalable</h3>\n<p>Attackers are using AI to automate vulnerability discovery, generate convincing social engineering attacks targeting developers, and systematically analyze public codebases for weaknesses. What once required manual effort can now be done at scale — with precision.</p>\n<h3>The AI development supply chain introduces new risks</h3>\n<p>AI is reshaping the entire development lifecycle, but it's also introducing significant security blind spots:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Model supply chain attacks:</strong> Pre-trained models from sources like Hugging Face or GitHub may contain backdoors or poisoned training data.</li>\n<li><strong>Insecure AI-generated code:</strong> Developers using AI coding assistants may unknowingly introduce vulnerable patterns or unsafe dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Compromised AI toolchains:</strong> The infrastructure used to train, deploy, and manage AI models creates a new attack surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated reconnaissance:</strong> AI enables attackers to scan entire ecosystems to identify high-impact supply chain targets.</li>\n<li><strong>Shadow AI and unsanctioned tools:</strong> Developers may integrate external AI tools that haven't been vetted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result? AI doesn't just introduce new vulnerabilities, it amplifies the scale and impact of existing ones. Organizations can no longer rely on incremental improvements. The threat landscape is evolving faster than current security practices can adapt.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI amplification effect\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753200139/xuxezxld6ztlvjocgjlx.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Why most organizations still struggle</h2>\n<p>Even organizations that understand supply chain security often fail to act effectively. The statistics reveal a troubling pattern of awareness without corresponding behavior change.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransom/index.html\">Colonial Pipeline paid hackers $4.4 million</a> in 2021 to restore operations, or when 18,000 organizations fell victim to the SolarWinds attack, the message was clear: Supply chain vulnerabilities can bring down critical infrastructure and compromise sensitive data at unprecedented scale.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite this awareness, most organizations continue with business as usual. The real question isn't whether organizations care about supply chain security — it's why caring alone isn't translating into effective protection.</p>\n<p>The answer lies in four critical barriers that prevent effective action:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The false economy mindset</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations sometimes focus on the cost instead of &quot;what's the most effective approach?&quot; This cost-first thinking creates expensive downstream problems.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Skills shortage reality</strong></p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://codific.com/bsimm-building-security-in-maturity-model-a-complete-guide/\">organizations averaging 4 security professionals per 100 developers</a>, according to BSIMM research, and <a href=\"https://www.isc2.org/Insights/2024/09/Employers-Must-Act-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Growth-Stalls-as-Skills-Gaps-Widen\">90% of organizations reporting critical cybersecurity skills gaps</a>, according to ISC2, traditional approaches are mathematically impossible to scale.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Misaligned organizational incentives</strong></p>\n<p>Developer OKRs focus on feature velocity while security teams measure different outcomes. When C-suite priorities emphasize speed-to-market over security posture, friction becomes inevitable.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Tool complexity overload</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-03-gartner-identifiesthe-top-cybersecurity-trends-for-2025\">average enterprise uses 45 cybersecurity tools</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.ponemon.org/news-updates/blog/security/new-ponemon-study-on-malware-detection-prevention-released.html\">40% of security alerts being false positives</a> and must <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-06-30-IBM-Study-Security-Response-Planning-on-the-Rise-But-Containing-Attacks-Remains-an-Issue\">coordinate across 19 tools on average for each incident</a>.</p>\n<p>These barriers create a vicious cycle: Organizations recognize the threat, invest in security solutions, but implement them in ways that don't drive the desired outcomes.</p>\n<h2>The true price of supply chain insecurity</h2>\n<p>Supply chain attacks create risk and expenses that extend far beyond initial remediation. Understanding these hidden multipliers helps explain why prevention is not just preferable – it's essential for business continuity.</p>\n<p><strong>Time becomes the enemy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average time to identify and contain a supply chain breach: <a href=\"https://keepnetlabs.com/blog/171-cyber-security-statistics-2024-s-updated-trends-and-data\">277 days</a></li>\n<li>Customer trust rebuilding period: <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/rebuilding-corporate-trust\">2-3+ years</a></li>\n<li>Engineering hours diverted from product development to security remediation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reputation damage compounds</strong></p>\n<p>When attackers compromise your supply chain, they don't just steal data – they undermine the foundation of customer trust. <a href=\"https://www.metacompliance.com/blog/data-breaches/5-damaging-consequences-of-a-data-breach\">Customer churn rates typically increase 33% post-breach</a>, while partner relationships require costly re-certification processes. Competitive positioning suffers as prospects choose alternatives perceived as &quot;safer.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory reality bites</strong></p>\n<p>The regulatory landscape has fundamentally shifted. <a href=\"https://www.skillcast.com/blog/20-biggest-gdpr-fines\">GDPR fines now average over $50 million for significant data breache</a>s. The EU's new <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-supports-banks-in-navigating-regulatory-challenges/#european-cyber-resilience-act-(cra)\">Cyber Resilience Act</a> mandates supply chain transparency. U.S. federal contractors must provide software bills of materials (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-sboms/\">SBOMs</a>) for all software purchases — a requirement that's rapidly spreading to private sector procurement.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational disruption multiplies</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond the direct costs, supply chain attacks create operational chaos such as platform downtime during attack remediation, emergency security audits across entire technology stacks, and legal costs from customer lawsuits and regulatory investigations.</p>\n<h2>What's wrong with current approaches</h2>\n<p>Most organizations confuse security activity with security impact. They deploy scanners, generate lengthy reports, and chase teams to address through manual follow-ups. But these efforts often backfire — creating more problems than they solve.</p>\n<h3>Massive scanning vs. effective protection</h3>\n<p>Enterprises generate over <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/enterprises-generate-10000-security-events-day-average-report/\">10,000 security alerts each month, with the most active generating roughly 150,000 events per day.</a> <a href=\"https://panther.com/blog/identifying-and-mitigating-false-positive-alerts\">But 63%</a> of these are false positives or low-priority noise. Security teams become overwhelmed and turn into bottlenecks instead of enablers.</p>\n<h3>The collaboration breakdown</h3>\n<p>The most secure organizations don't have the most tools; they have the strongest DevSecOps collaboration. But most current setups make this harder by splitting workflows across incompatible tools, failing to show developers security results in their environment, and offering no shared visibility into risk and business impact.</p>\n<h2>The path forward</h2>\n<p>Understanding these challenges is the first step toward building effective supply chain security. The organizations that succeed don't just add more security tools, they fundamentally rethink how security integrates with development workflows. They also review end-to-end software delivery workflows to simplify processes, reduce tools and improve collaboration.</p>\n<p>At GitLab, we've seen how integrated DevSecOps platforms can address these challenges by bringing security directly into the development workflow. In our next article in this series, we'll explore how leading organizations are transforming their approach to supply chain security through developer-native solutions, AI-powered automation, and platforms that make security a natural part of building great software.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/supply-chain/\">GitLab's software supply chain security capabilities</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

      "summary": "<p>Our most recent release, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/07/17/gitlab-18-2-released/\">GitLab 18.2</a>, introduces two new capabilities to improve software supply chain security: Security Inventory and Dependency Path visualization.</p>\n<p>Security Inventory gives Application Security teams a centralized, portfolio-wide view of risk and scan coverage across their GitLab groups and projects, helping them identify blind spots and prioritize risk mitigation efforts. Dependency Path visualization equips developers with a clear view of how open source vulnerabilities are introduced through the dependency chain, making it easier to pinpoint the right fix.</p>\n<p>Together, these capabilities help security and development teams build more secure applications by providing visibility into where risks exist, context to remediate them, and workflows that support collaboration. Unlike other solutions, this all happens in the same platform developers use to build, review, and deploy software, creating a developer and AppSec experience without the overhead of integrations.</p>\n<h2>Open source widens the attack surface area</h2>\n<p>Modern applications <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/\">heavily</a> rely on open source software. However, open source introduces a significant security risk — components can be outdated, unmaintained, or unknowingly expose vulnerabilities. That's why Software Composition Analysis (SCA) has become a cornerstone of modern AppSec programs.</p>\n<p>A key challenge in vulnerability management is effectively managing <em>transitive dependency risk</em>. These components are often buried deep in the dependency chain, making it difficult to trace how a vulnerability was introduced or determine what needs to be updated to fix it. Worse, they account for nearly <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22134\">two-thirds</a> of known open source vulnerabilities. Without clear visibility into the full dependency path, teams are left guessing, delaying remediation and increasing risk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Transitive dependencies are packages that your application uses indirectly. They're pulled in automatically by the direct dependencies you explicitly include. These nested dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities without the developer ever knowing they're in the project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This challenge becomes exponentially more difficult at scale. When security teams are responsible for hundreds, or even thousands, of repositories — each with their own dependencies, build pipelines, and owners — answering fundamental questions on application security risk posture becomes challenging. And in an era of growing software supply chain threats, where vulnerabilities can propagate across systems through shared libraries and CI/CD configurations, these blind spots take on even greater consequence.</p>\n<h2>Security Inventory: Visibility that scales</h2>\n<p>Security Inventory consolidates risk information across all your groups and projects into a unified view. It highlights which assets are covered by security scans and which aren't. Rather than managing issues in isolation, security teams can assess posture holistically and identify where to focus efforts.</p>\n<p>This level of centralization is especially critical for organizations managing a large number of repositories. It allows platform and AppSec teams to understand where risk exists by highlighting unscanned or underprotected projects, but also enables them to take action directly from the interface. Teams can go beyond just awareness to enforcement with the full context and understanding of which applications pose the greatest risk. By turning fragmented insights into a single source of truth, Security Inventory enables organizations to move from reactive issue triage to strategic, data-driven security governance.\n<img alt=\"Security Inventory display\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753101068/qhujktnbkhl2rzgqfead.png\" />\nLearn more by watching Security Inventory in action:\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yqo6aJLS9Fw?si=CtYmsF-PLN1UKt83&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<h2>Dependency Path visualization: Clarity for effective remediation</h2>\n<p>Security Inventory shows where the risks are at a high level; Dependency Path visualization shows how to fix them.</p>\n<p>When a vulnerability is discovered deep in a dependency chain, identifying the correct fix can be complicated. Most security tools will highlight the affected package but stop short of explaining how it entered the codebase. Developers are left guessing which dependencies are directly introduced and which are pulled in transitively, making it difficult to determine where a change is needed, or worse, applying patches that don't address the root cause.</p>\n<p>Our new Dependency Path visualization, sometimes referred to as a dependency graph, displays the full route from a top-level package to the vulnerable component following an SCA scan. This clarity is essential, especially given how pervasive deeply embedded vulnerabilities are in dependency chains. And since it's built into the GitLab workflow, developers gain actionable insight without context switching or guesswork. Security teams can more effectively triage issues while developers get assurance that remediations are addressing root causes.\n<img alt=\"Dependency path visualization\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1753101069/kf5ym62gylm5ck6iebjk.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Mitigate risk with developer-first security</h2>\n<p>These capabilities are part of GitLab's broader strategy to deliver security within the same platform where code is planned, built, and deployed. By embedding security insights into the DevSecOps workflow, GitLab reduces friction and drives collaboration between development and security teams.</p>\n<p>Security Inventory and Dependency Path visualization provide complementary perspectives: the former enables scale-aware oversight, the latter supports precision fixes. This alignment helps teams prioritize what matters most and close gaps without adding new tools or complex integrations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get started with Security Inventory and Dependency Path visualization today!

      "summary": "<p><strong>We're building the future of software development.</strong></p>\n<p>At GitLab, we are <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-what-is-next-for-intelligent-devsecops/\">reimagining the future of software engineering</a> as a human and AI collaboration. Where developers focus on solving technical, complex problems and driving innovation, while AI agents handle the routine, repetitive tasks that slow down progress. Where developers are free to explore new ideas in code at much lower cost, bug backlogs are a thing of the past, and users of the software you build enjoy a more usable, reliable, and secure experience. This isn't a distant dream. We're building this reality today, and it is called the GitLab Duo Agent Platform.</p>\n<h2>What is GitLab Duo Agent Platform?</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform is our next-generation DevSecOps orchestration platform designed to unlock asynchronous collaboration between developers and AI agents. It will transform your development workflow from isolated linear processes into dynamic collaboration where specialized AI agents work alongside you and your team on every stage of the software development lifecycle; it will be like having an unlimited team of colleagues at your disposal.</p>\n<p>Imagine delegating a complex refactoring task to a Software Developer Agent while simultaneously having a Security Analyst Agent scan for vulnerabilities and a Deep Research Agent analyze progress across your repository history. This all happens in parallel, orchestrated seamlessly within GitLab.</p>\n<p>Today, we are announcing the launch of the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">first public beta of the GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a> for GitLab.com and self-managed GitLab Premium and Ultimate customers. This is just the first in a series of updates that will improve how software gets planned, built, verified, and deployed as we amplify human ingenuity through intelligent automation.</p>\n<p>This first beta focuses on unlocking the IDE experience through the GitLab VS Code extension and JetBrains IDEs plug-in; next month, we plan on bringing the Duo Agent Platform experience to the GitLab application and expand our IDE support. Let me share a bit more about our vision for the roadmap between now and general availability, planned for later this year. You can find details about the first beta down below.</p>\n<p>Watch this video or read on for what's available now and what's to come. Then, if you're ready to get started with Duo Agent Platform, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#get-started-now\">find out how with the public beta</a>.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1101993507?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;GitLab Agent Platform Beta Launch_071625_MP_v2&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>GitLab's unique position as an orchestration platform</h2>\n<p>GitLab sits at the heart of the development lifecycle as the system of record for engineering teams, orchestrating the entire journey from concept to production for over 50 million registered users, including half of the Fortune 500 across geographies. This includes over 10,000 paying customers across all segments and verticals, including public institutions.</p>\n<p>This gives GitLab something no competitor can match: a comprehensive understanding of everything it takes to deliver software. We bring together your project plans, code, test runs, security scans, compliance checks, and CI/CD configurations to not only power your team but also orchestrate collaboration with AI agents you control.</p>\n<p>As an intelligent, unified DevSecOps platform, GitLab stores all of the context about your software engineering practice in one place. We will expose this unified data to AI agents via our knowledge graph. Every agent we build has automatic access to this SDLC-connected data set, providing rich context so agents can make informed recommendations and take actions that adhere to your organizational standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Here's an example of this advantage in action.</strong> Have you ever tried to figure out exactly how a project is going across dozens, if not hundreds, of stories and issues being worked on across all the developers involved? Our Deep Research Agent leverages the GitLab Knowledge Graph and semantic search capabilities to traverse your epic and all related issues, and explore the related codebase and surrounding context. It quickly correlates information across your repositories, merge requests, and deployment history. This delivers critical insights that standalone tools can't match and that would take human developers hours to uncover.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1101998114?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Deep Research Demo_071625_MP_v1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>Our strategic evolution from AI features to agent orchestration</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo started as an add-on, bringing generative AI to developers through Duo Pro and Enterprise. With GitLab 18.0, it's now built into the platform. We've unlocked <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-chat-gets-agentic-ai-makeover/\">Duo Agentic Chat</a> and Code Suggestions for all Premium and Ultimate users, and now we're providing immediate access to the Duo Agent Platform.</p>\n<p>We've ramped up engineering investment and are accelerating delivery, with powerful new AI features landing every month. But we're not just building another coding assistant. GitLab Duo is becoming an agent orchestration platform, where you can create, customize, and deploy AI agents that work alongside you and interoperate easily with other systems, dramatically increasing productivity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“GitLab Duo Agent Platform enhances our development workflow with AI that truly understands our codebase and our organization. Having GitLab Duo AI agents embedded in our system of record for code, tests, CI/CD, and the entire software development lifecycle boosts productivity, velocity, and efficiency. The agents have become true collaborators to our teams, and their ability to understand intent, break down problems, and take action frees our developers to tackle the exciting, innovative work they love.”</strong> - Bal Kang, Engineering Platform Lead at NatWest</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Agents that work out of the box</h3>\n<p>We are introducing agents that mirror familiar team roles. These agents can search, read, create, and modify existing artifacts across GitLab. Think of these as agents you can interact with individually, that also act as building blocks that you can customize to create your own agents. Like your team members, agents have defined specializations, such as software development, testing, or technical writing. As specialists, they're tapping into the right context and tools to consistently accomplish the same types of tasks, wherever they're deployed.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the agents we're building today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chat Agent (now in beta):</strong> Takes natural language requests to provide information and context to the user. Can perform general development tasks, such as reading issues or code diffs. As an example, you can ask Chat to debug a failed job by providing the job URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1102616311?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;agentic-chat-in-web-ui-demo_Update V2&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Software Developer Agent (now in beta):</strong> Works on assigned items by creating code changes in virtual development environments and opening merge requests for review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product Planning Agent:</strong> Prioritizes product backlogs, assigns work items to human and agentic team members, and provides project updates over specified timelines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Software Test Engineer Agent:</strong> Tests new code contributions for bugs and validates if reported issues have been resolved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Code Reviewer Agent:</strong> Performs code reviews following team standards, identifies quality and security issues, and can merge code when ready.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Platform Engineer Agent:</strong> Monitors GitLab deployments, including GitLab Runners, tracks CI/CD pipeline health, and reports performance issues to human platform engineering teams.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Security Analyst Agent:</strong> Finds vulnerabilities within codebases and deployed applications, and implements code and configuration changes to help resolve security weaknesses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deployment Engineer Agent:</strong> Deploys updates to production, monitors for unusual behavior, and rolls back changes that impact application performance or security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deep Research Agent:</strong> Conducts comprehensive, multi-source analysis across your entire development ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What makes these agents powerful is their native access to GitLab's comprehensive toolkit. Today, we have over 25 tools, from issues and epics to merge requests and documentation, with more to come. Unlike external AI tools that operate with limited context, our agents work as true team members with full platform privileges under your supervision.</p>\n<p>In the coming months, you'll also be able to modify these agents to meet the needs of your organization. For example, you'll be able to specify that a Software Test Engineer Agent follows best practices for a particular framework or methodology, deepening its specialization and turning it into an even more valuable team member.</p>\n<h2>Flows orchestrate complex agent tasks</h2>\n<p>On top of individual agents, we are introducing agent Flows. Think of these as more complex workflows that can include multiple agents with pre-built instructions, steps, and actions for a given task that can run autonomously.</p>\n<p>While you can create Flows for basic tasks common to individuals, they truly excel when applied to complex, specialized tasks that would normally take hours of coordination and effort to complete. Flows will help you finish complex tasks faster and, in many cases, asynchronously without human intervention.</p>\n<p>Flows have specific triggers for execution. Each Flow contains a series of steps, and each step has detailed instructions that tell a specialized agent what to do. This granular approach allows  you to give precise instructions to agents in the Flow. By defining instructions in greater detail and establishing structured decision points, Flows can help solve for the inherent variability in AI responses while eliminating the need to repeatedly specify the same requirements, unlocking more consistent and predictable outcomes without user configuration.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of out-of-the-box Flows that we are building:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Software Development Flow (now in beta):</strong> Orchestrates multiple agents to plan, implement, and test code changes end-to-end, helping transform how teams deliver features from concept to production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Issue-to-MR Flow:</strong> Automatically converts issues into actionable merge requests by coordinating agents to analyze requirements, prepare comprehensive implementation plans, and generate code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Convert CI File Flow:</strong> Streamlines migration workflows by having agents analyze existing CI/CD configurations and intelligently convert them to GitLab CI format with full pipeline compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1101941425?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;jenkins-to-gitlab-cicd-for-blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Search and Replace Flow:</strong> Discovers and transforms code patterns across codebases by systematically analyzing project structures, identifying optimization opportunities, and executing precise replacements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incident Response &amp; Root Cause Analysis Flow:</strong> Orchestrates incident response by correlating system data, coordinating specialized agents for root cause analysis, and executing approved remediation steps while keeping human stakeholders informed throughout the resolution process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is where GitLab Duo Agent Platform is taking a truly unique approach versus other AI solutions. We won't just give you pre-built agents. We'll also give you the power to create, customize, and share agent Flows that perfectly match your individual and organization's unique needs. And with Flows, you will then be able to give agents a specific execution plan for common and complex tasks.</p>\n<p>We believe this approach is more powerful than building purpose-built agents like our competitors do, because every organization has different workflows, coding standards, security requirements, and business logic. Generic AI tools can't understand your specific context, but GitLab Duo Agent Platform will be able to be tailored to work exactly how your team works.</p>\n<h2>Why build agents and agent Flows in the GitLab Duo Agent Platform?</h2>\n<p><strong>Build fast.</strong> You can build agents and complex agent Flows in the Duo Agent Platform quickly and easily using a fast, declarative extensibility model and UI assistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in compute.</strong> With Duo Agent Platform, you no longer have to worry about the hassle of standing up your own infrastructure for agents: compute, network, and storage are all built-in.</p>\n<p><strong>SDLC events.</strong> Your agents can be invoked automatically on common events: broken pipeline, failed deployment, issue created, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Instant access.</strong> You can interact with your agents everywhere in GitLab or our IDE plug-in: assign them issues, @mention them in comments, and chat with them everywhere Duo Chat is available.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1102029239?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;assigning an agent an issue&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>Built-in and custom models supported.</strong> Your agents will have automatic access to all of the models we support, and users will be able to choose specific models for specific tasks. If you want to connect Duo Agent Platform to your own self-hosted model, you will be able to do that too!</p>\n<p><strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP) endpoints.</strong> Every agent and Flow can be accessed or triggered via native MCP endpoints, allowing you to connect to and collaborate with your agents and Flows from anywhere, including popular tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and Windsurf.</p>\n<p><strong>Observability and security.</strong> Finally, we provide built-in observability and usage dashboards, so you can see exactly who, where, what, and when agents took actions on your behalf.</p>\n<h2>A community-driven future</h2>\n<p>Community contributions have long fueled GitLab's innovation and software development. We're excited to partner with our community with the introduction of the AI Catalog. The AI Catalog will allow you to create and share agents and Flows within your organization and across the GitLab Ecosystem in our upcoming beta.</p>\n<p>We believe that the most valuable AI applications are likely to emerge from you, our community, thanks to your daily application of GitLab Duo Agent Platform to solve numerous real-world use cases. By enabling seamless sharing of agents and Flows, we're creating a network effect where each contribution enhances the platform's collective intelligence and value. Over time, we believe that the most valuable use cases from Agent Platform will come from our thriving GitLab community.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI Catalog\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752685501/awdwx08udwrxgvcpmssb.png\" title=\"AI Catalog\" /></p>\n<h2>Available today in the GitLab Duo Agent Platform in public beta</h2>\n<p>The GitLab Duo Agent Platform public beta is available now to Premium and Ultimate customers with these capabilities:</p>\n<p><strong>Software Development Flow:</strong> Our first Flow orchestrates agents in gathering comprehensive context, clarifying ambiguities with human developers, and executing strategic plans to make precise changes to your codebase and repository.

This foundational mechanism shapes the agent's persona into a personalized assistant, evolving toward specialized agents based on user-defined preferences and organizational policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1101743179?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;custom-rules-with-jc-voiceover&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Support for GitLab Duo Agentic Chat in JetBrains IDE:</strong> To help meet developers where they work, we have expanded Duo Agentic Chat support to the JetBrains family of IDEs, including IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand, and Webstorm. This adds to our existing support for VS Code. Existing users get agentic capabilities automatically, while new users can install the plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1101743193?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;jetbrains-support-jc-voiceover&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MCP client support:</strong> Duo Agentic Chat can now act as an MCP client, connecting to remote and locally running MCP servers. This capability unlocks the agent's ability to connect to systems beyond GitLab like Jira, ServiceNow, and ZenDesk to gather context or take actions. Any service that exposes itself via MCP can now become part of the agent's skill set. The official GitLab MCP Server is coming soon!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1101743202?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;McpDemo&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GitLab Duo Agentic Chat in GitLab Web UI.</strong> Duo Agentic Chat is also now available directly within the GitLab Web UI. This pivotal step evolves the agent from a coding assistant to a true DevSecOps agent, as it gains access to rich non-code context, such as issues and merge request discussions, allowing it to understand the &quot;why&quot; behind the work. Beyond understanding context, the agent can make changes directly from the WebUI, such as automatically updating issue statuses or editing merge request descriptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Coming soon to GitLab Duo Agent Platform</h2>\n<p>Over the coming weeks, we'll release new capabilities to Duo Agent Platform, including more out-of-the-box agents and Flows. These will bring the platform into the GitLab experience you love today and enable even greater customization and extensibility, amplifying productivity for our customers:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Duo Agent Platform public beta roadmap\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752685275/hjbe9iiu2ydp9slibsc2.png\" title=\"GitLab Duo Agent Platform public beta roadmap\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrated GitLab experience:</strong> Building on the IDE extensions available in 18.2, we're expanding agents and Flows within the GitLab platform. This deeper integration will expand the ways you can collaborate synchronously and asynchronously with agents. You will be able to assign issues directly to agents, @mention them within GitLab Duo Chat, and seamlessly invoke them from anywhere in the application while maintaining MCP connectivity from your developer tool of choice. This native integration transforms agents into true development team members, accessible across GitLab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent observability:</strong> As agents become more autonomous, we're building comprehensive visibility into their activity as they progress through Flows, enabling you to monitor their decision-making processes, track execution steps, and understand how they're interpreting and acting on your development challenges. This transparency into agent behavior builds trust and confidence while allowing you to optimize workflows and identify bottlenecks, and helps ensure agents are performing exactly as intended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AI Catalog:</strong> Recognizing that great solutions come from community innovation, we will soon introduce the public beta of our AI Catalog — a marketplace which will allow you to extend Duo Agent Platform with specialized Agents and Flows sourced from GitLab, and over time, the broader community.  You'll be able to quickly deploy these solutions in GitLab, leveraging context across your projects and codebase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Knowledge Graph:</strong> Leveraging GitLab's unique advantage as the system of record for source code and its surrounding context, we're building a comprehensive Knowledge Graph that not only maps files and dependencies across the codebase but also makes that map navigable for users while accelerating AI query times and helping increase accuracy. This foundation enables GitLab Duo agents to quickly understand relationships across your entire development environment, from code dependencies to deployment patterns, unlocking faster and more precise responses to complex questions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Duo Agent Platform Knowledge Graph\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752685367/n0tvfgorchuhrronic3j.png\" title=\"GitLab Duo Agent Platform Knowledge Graph\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create and edit agents and Flows:</strong> Understanding that every organization has unique workflows and requirements, we're developing powerful agent and Flow creation and editing capabilities that will be introduced as the AI Catalog matures. You'll be able to create and modify agents and Flows to operate precisely the way your organization works, delivering deep customization across the Duo Agent Platform that enables higher quality results and increased productivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"AI Catalog\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752684938/fruwqcqvvrx8gmkz5u0v.png\" title=\"AI Catalog\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Official GitLab MCP Server:</strong> Recognizing that developers work across multiple tools and environments, we're building an official GitLab MCP server that will enable you to access all of your agents and Flows via MCP. You'll be able to connect to and collaborate with your agents and Flows from anywhere MCP is supported, including popular tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and Windsurf, unlocking seamless AI collaboration regardless of your preferred development environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GitLab Duo Agent Platform CLI:</strong> Our upcoming CLI will allow you to invoke agents and trigger Flows on the command line, leveraging GitLab's rich context across the entire software development lifecycle—from code repositories and merge requests to CI/CD pipelines and issue tracking.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Get started now</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GitLab Premium and Ultimate customers</strong> in GitLab.com and self-managed environments using GitLab 18.2 can use Duo Agent Platform immediately (beta and experimental features for GitLab Duo <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/turn_on_off/#turn-on-beta-and-experimental-features\">must be enabled</a>).

      "summary": "<p>GitLab's Contributor Success team faced a challenge.\nWhile our returning open source contributors were merging more code changes and collaborating on deeper features, first-time contributors were struggling to get started. We knew many newcomers to open source often gave up or never asked for help. But as advocates for <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/mission/\">GitLab's mission</a>\nto enable everyone to contribute, we wanted to do better.</p>\n<p>We started running research studies on open source contributors to GitLab. Then we improved the stumbling blocks. In January, we achieved a record of 184 unique community contributors to GitLab in a single month,\nexceeding our team target of 170 for the first time.</p>\n<p>Three months later, we broke it again with 192.</p>\n<p>Here's how we used GitLab's own tools to solve the newcomer dilemma and grow our open source community.</p>\n<h2>What we learned studying first-time contributors</h2>\n<p>In 2023, we conducted the first-ever user study of GitLab open source contributors.\nWe watched six participants who had never contributed to GitLab make their first attempt. They completed diary studies and Zoom interviews detailing their experience.</p>\n<p>Participants told us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The contributor documentation was confusing</li>\n<li>Getting started felt overwhelming</li>\n<li>It wasn't clear how or where to find help</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only one out of the six participants successfully merged a code contribution to GitLab during the study.</p>\n<p>It became clear we needed to focus on the onboarding experience if we wanted new contributors to succeed.\nSo we <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration\">iterated</a>!</p>\n<p>Our team spent the next year addressing their challenges. We used GitLab tools,\nsuch as issue templates, scheduled pipelines, webhooks, and the GitLab Query Language (GLQL), to build an innovative semi-automated onboarding solution.</p>\n<p>In 2025, we performed a follow-up user study with new participants who had never made a contribution to GitLab. All 10 participants successfully created and merged contributions to GitLab, a 100% success rate. The feedback showed a great appreciation for the new onboarding process, the speed at which\nmaintainers checked in on contributors, and the recognition we offered to contributors.</p>\n<p>Even better, participants shared how much fun they had contributing:\n&quot;I felt a little rush of excitement at being able to say 'I helped build GitLab.'&quot;</p>\n<h2>We built personal onboarding with GitLab</h2>\n<p>Our solution started with engagement.\nTo help newcomers get started, we introduced a personal onboarding process connecting each\ncontributor with a community maintainer.</p>\n<p>We created an <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-community/meta/-/blob/ac0e5579a6a1cf26e367010bfcf6c7d35b38d4f8/.gitlab/issue_templates/Onboarding.md\">issue template</a> with a clear checklist of tasks.</p>\n<p>The onboarding issue also handles access approval for the\n<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-community-forks/\">GitLab community forks</a>,\na collection of shared projects that make it easier to push changes, collaborate with others,\nand access GitLab Ultimate and Duo features.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/labels/#scoped-labels\">scoped labels</a>, we indicate the status of the access request for easy maintainer follow-ups.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab onboarding issue\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512804/vkiyl0hrfbgcer3nz38r.png\" /></p>\n<p>We started with a Ruby script run via a <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/schedules/\">scheduled pipeline</a>,\nchecking for new access requests and using the issue template to create personalized onboarding issues.</p>\n<p>From here, our maintainers engage with new contributors to verify access, answer questions, and find issues.</p>\n<h2>We standardized responses with comment templates</h2>\n<p>With multiple maintainers in the GitLab community, we wanted to ensure consistent and clear messaging.</p>\n<p>We created <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/comment_templates/\">comment templates</a>,\nwhich we sync with the repository using the GraphQL API and a\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-community/meta/-/blob/dd6e0c2861c848251424b72e3e8c5603dcaac725/bin/sync_comment_templates.rb\">Ruby script</a>.</p>\n<p>The script is triggered in <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> when comment template changes are pushed\nto the default branch (a dry run is triggered in merge requests).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">execute:sync-comment-templates:\n  stage: execute\n  extends: .ruby\n  script:\n    - bundle exec bin/sync_comment_templates.rb\n  variables:\n    SYNC_COMMENT_TEMPLATES_GITLAB_API_TOKEN: $SYNC_COMMENT_TEMPLATES_GITLAB_API_TOKEN_READ_ONLY\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'schedule' || $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == &quot;trigger&quot;\n      when: never\n    - if: $EXECUTE_SYNC_COMMENT_TEMPLATES == '1'\n    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID\n      changes:\n        - .gitlab/comment_templates/**/*\n      variables:\n        REPORT_ONLY: 1\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH\n      changes:\n        - .gitlab/comment_templates/**/*\n      variables:\n        FORCE_SYNC: 1\n        DRY_RUN: 0\n        SYNC_COMMENT_TEMPLATES_GITLAB_API_TOKEN: $SYNC_COMMENT_TEMPLATES_GITLAB_API_TOKEN_READ_WRITE\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab comment template\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512803/qmfaymqhq3zgdcnm6a3j.png\" /></p>\n<h2>We eliminated the 5-minute wait time</h2>\n<p>Our first iteration was a little slow.\nAfter starting the onboarding process, contributors wondered what to do next while the scheduled\npipeline took up to 5 minutes to create their onboarding issue.\nFive minutes feels like forever when you have the momentum to dive in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/Taucher2003\">Niklas</a>, a member of our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/community/core-team/\">Core team </a>, built a solution.\nHe added <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/163094\">webhook events for access requests</a>\nand <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/142738\">custom payload templates for webhooks</a>.</p>\n<p>These features together allowed us to trigger a pipeline immediately instead of waiting for the schedule.\nThis reduces the time to roughly 40 seconds (the time it takes for the CI pipeline to run)\nand generates the onboarding issue right away. It also saves thousands of wasted pipelines and compute minutes when no access requests actually need processing.</p>\n<p>We set up a <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/triggers/#create-a-pipeline-trigger-token\">pipeline trigger token</a>\nand used this as the target for the webhook, passing the desired environment variables:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;main&quot;,\n  &quot;variables&quot;: {\n    &quot;EXECUTE_ACCESS_REQUESTS&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\n    &quot;DRY_RUN&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,\n    &quot;PIPELINE_NAME&quot;: &quot;Create onboarding issues&quot;,\n    &quot;GROUP_ID&quot;: &quot;{{group_id}}&quot;,\n    &quot;EVENT_NAME&quot;: &quot;{{event_name}}&quot;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"Pipeline list\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512805/qom7hnqnwfcdzvria7dd.png\" /></p>\n<h2>We automated follow-ups</h2>\n<p>With an increasing volume of customers and community contributors onboarding to the GitLab community,\nmaintainers struggled to track which issues needed attention and some follow-up questions got lost.</p>\n<p>We built automation leveraging webhooks and Ruby to label issues updated by community members.\nThis creates a clear signal of issue status for maintainers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage\">GitLab Triage</a>\nautomatically nudges idle onboarding issues to ensure we maintain contributor momentum.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Automated nudge for idle GitLab onboarding issues\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512811/gkj3qaidjl1vv2dlu8ep.png\" /></p>\n<h2>We organized issue tracking with GLQL</h2>\n<p>We built a <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/\">GLQL view</a> to keep track of issues.\nThis GLQL table summarizes onboarding issues which need attention,\nso maintainers can review and follow up with community members.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GLQL view of issue tracking\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512804/hdduf0orntdfhkysheae.png\" /></p>\n<p>These GLQL views improved our overall triage <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency\">efficiency</a>.\nIt was so successful we ended up using this strategy within the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/\">GitLab for Open Source</a>\nand <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/\">GitLab for Education</a> programs, too.\nWith GLQL tables for support issues, these community programs lowered their response times by 75%.</p>\n<h2>We made the README findable</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-community/\">@gitlab-community group</a>\nis the home for contributors on Gitlab.com.\nWe already had a <code>README.md</code> file explaining the community forks and onboarding process, but this file\nlived in our meta project.\nWith our follow-up user study, we discovered this was a point of confusion for newcomers when their\nonboarding issues were under a different project.</p>\n<p>We used <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/mirror/\">GitLab's project mirroring</a>\nto solve this and mirrored the meta project to <code>gitlab-profile</code>.\nThis surfaced the existing README file at the group level, making it easier to discover.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab project mirroiring\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512809/kbgdxyilza71kmj0aeqt.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Group README\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512804/taosgn8vvgo8onszuwaf.png\" /></p>\n<h2>The results speak for themselves</h2>\n<p>By dogfooding GitLab, we improved the stumbling blocks found in our research studies\nand transformed the GitLab contributor journey.\nWe have grown the number of customers and community members contributing to GitLab,\nadding features to the product, solving bugs, and adding to our CI/CD catalog.</p>\n<p>Our onboarding process has increased the rate newcomers join the community, and our total number of\ncontributors on the community forks has doubled over the last 9 months.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Community forks growth chart\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512803/xagra4vfsrhbcwnzekmp.png\" /></p>\n<p>We reduced the time it takes for newcomers to make their first contribution by connecting them\nwith maintainers faster and supporting them in getting started.\nWe use <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/value_stream_analytics/\">GitLab's value stream analytics</a>\nto track our response rates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First response time from community maintainers is down to 46 minutes over the last 3 months</li>\n<li>Average approval time for community forks access is down to 1 hour over the last 3 months</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Value stream analytics timeline\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1752512812/jzksakrfdb22hooqemzh.png\" /></p>\n<p>The 100% success rate of our 2025 user study confirmed these improvements for our first-time contributors.</p>\n<h2>We invested time savings into contributor recognition</h2>\n<p>Fixing these newcomer challenges allowed us more capacity to focus on better recognition of\ncontributors, incentivizing first-timers to keep coming back.\nThe result is <a href=\"https://contributors.gitlab.com/\">contributors.gitlab.com</a>.\nWe built out a central hub for our contributors that features gamified leaderboards,\nachievements, and rewards.\nContributors can see their impact, track progress, and grow in the community.</p>\n<h2>Sharing what we learned</h2>\n<p>These improvements work and are repeatable for other open source projects.\nWe are sharing our approach across communities and conferences so that other projects can consider using these tools to grow.</p>\n<p>As more organizations learn the barriers to participation, we can create a more welcoming open source environment.\nWith these GitLab tools, we can offer a smoother experience for both contributors and maintainers.\nWe're committed to advancing this work and collaborating to remove barriers for open source projects everywhere.</p>\n<h2>Start the conversation</h2>\n<p>Want to learn more about growing your contributor community?\nEmail <code>contributors@gitlab.com</code> or <a

These changes have eliminated the frustration of accidentally deleting important content with no recovery option.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/05/15/gitlab-18-0-released/#deletion-protection-available-for-all-users\"><strong>Pending deletion for all users</strong></a><strong>:</strong> All deleted projects and groups now enter a &quot;pending deletion&quot; state before being permanently deleted, regardless of their pricing tier.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/05/15/gitlab-18-0-released/#delayed-project-deletion-for-user-namespaces\"><strong>Self-service recovery</strong></a><strong>:</strong> You can now restore your own content without contacting support, giving you more control and autonomy over your data.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/502234\"><strong>Clear status indicators</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We have standardized how deletion status is displayed across the platform, making it immediately clear when content is pending deletion.</li>\n<li><strong>Extended recovery window:</strong> On July 10, 2025, we increased the pending deletion period from 7 to 30 days on GitLab.com. This means you now have ample time to recover from accidental deletions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's coming next</h2>\n<h3>Currently in development</h3>\n<p>Building on the foundation established in our first iteration, we are further enhancing your deletion experience with two key improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/17372\"><strong>Admin area consistency</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Deletions initiated from the Admin area will follow the same pending deletion process as deletions initiated directly from the group or project level, creating a unified experience across all access points.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/526081\"><strong>Immediate path reuse</strong></a><strong>:</strong> When you delete a project or group, its namespace path will be automatically renamed, allowing you to immediately reuse the original path for new content. This will remove the waiting period currently required to reuse namespace paths.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Planned for future release</h3>\n<p>The final phase will introduce a redesigned deletion experience that completes our vision for a modern, intuitive deletion system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centralized &quot;Trash&quot; interface:</strong> All your deleted content will be accessible in a dedicated &quot;Trash&quot; section, providing a familiar paradigm similar to what you're used to in other applications.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/541182\"><strong>Clear action separation</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We will create a clear distinction between &quot;Delete&quot; (temporary, recoverable) and &quot;Delete Permanently&quot; (irrevocable) actions to prevent accidental data loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk management:</strong> You'll be able to restore or permanently delete multiple items at once, making cleanup and recovery more efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How these changes benefit you</h2>\n<p>These enhancements deliver several key benefits that will transform your experience with GitLab's deletion functionality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Protection against data loss</strong> is provided through pending deletion and self-service recovery available across all tiers, giving you a safety net against accidental deletions. The <strong>consistent experience</strong> ensures the same deletion flow applies to all projects and groups, eliminating inconsistencies across the platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You'll gain <strong>greater control</strong> through enhanced visibility and management options for deleted content, with a familiar interface that makes recovery intuitive. <strong>Improved workflow</strong> efficiency will result from immediate path reuse and bulk management capabilities that streamline your content organization process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most importantly, you'll have <strong>peace of mind</strong> knowing that the extended 30-day recovery window ensures ample opportunity to recover important data, while the clear separation between temporary and permanent deletion actions prevents accidental data loss.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Your feedback matters</h2>\n<p>As always, we value your input.

      "published": "2025-07-10T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>AI has rapidly become a core part of modern software development. Not only is it helping developers code faster than ever, but it’s also automating low-level tasks like writing test cases or summarizing documentation. According to our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/\">2024 Global DevSecOps Survey</a>, 81% of developers are already using AI in their workflows or plan to in the next two years.</p>\n<p>As code is written with less manual effort, we’re seeing a subtle but important behavioral change: Developers are beginning to trust AI-generated code with less scrutiny. That confidence — understandable as it may be — can quietly introduce security risks, especially as the overall volume of code increases. Developers can’t be expected to stay on top of every vulnerability or exploit, which is why we need systems and safeguards that scale with them. AI tools are here to stay. So, as security professionals, it’s incumbent on you to empower developers to adopt them in a way that improves both speed and security.</p>\n<p>Here are three practical ways to do that.</p>\n<h2>Never trust, always verify</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, developers are beginning to trust AI-generated code more readily, especially when it looks clean and compiles without error. To combat this, adopt a zero-trust mindset. While we often talk about <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/why-devops-and-zero-trust-go-together/\">zero trust</a> in the context of identity and access management, the same principle can be applied here with a slightly different framing. Treat AI-generated code like input from a junior developer: helpful, but not production-ready without a proper review.</p>\n<p>A developer should be able to explain what the code is doing and why it’s safe before it gets merged. Reviewing AI-generated code might even shape up to be an emerging skillset required in the world of software development. The developers who excel at this will be indispensable because they’ll marry the speed of LLMs with the risk reduction mindset to produce secure code, faster.</p>\n<p>This is where tools like <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/duo_in_merge_requests/\">GitLab Duo Code Review</a> can help. As a feature of our AI companion across the software development lifecycle, it brings AI into the code review process, not to replace human judgment, but to enhance it. By surfacing questions, inconsistencies, and overlooked issues in the merge requests, AI can help developers keep up with the very AI that’s accelerating development cycles.</p>\n<h2>Prompt for secure patterns</h2>\n<p>Large language models (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-is-a-large-language-model-llm/\">LLMs</a>)  are powerful, but only as precise as the prompts they’re given. That’s why prompt engineering is becoming a core part of working with AI tools. In the world of LLMs, your input <em>is</em> the interface. Developers who learn to write clear, security-aware prompts will play a key role in building safer software from the start.</p>\n<p>For example, vague requests like “build a login form” often produce insecure or overly simplistic results. However, by including more context, such as “build a login form <strong>with</strong> input validation, rate limiting, and hashing, <strong>and</strong> support phishing-resistant authentication methods like passkeys,” you’re more likely to produce an output that meets the security standards of your organization.</p>\n<p>Recent <a href=\"https://www.backslash.security/press-releases/backslash-security-reveals-in-new-research-that-gpt-4-1-other-popular-llms-generate-insecure-code-unless-explicitly-prompted\">research</a> from Backlash Security backs this up. They found that secure prompting improved results across popular LLMs. When developers simply asked models to “write secure code,” success rates remained low. However, when prompts referenced <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LLM_Prompt_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html\">OWASP best practices</a>, the rate of secure code generation increased.</p>\n<p>Prompt engineering should be part of how we train and empower security champions within development teams. Just like we teach secure coding patterns and threat modeling, we should also be teaching developers how to guide AI tools with the same security mindset.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn more with these helpful <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/development/ai_features/prompt_engineering/\">prompt engineering tips</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Scan everything, no exceptions</h2>\n<p>The rise of AI means we’re writing more code, quicker, with the same number of humans. That shift should change how we think about security, not just as a final check, but as an always-on safeguard woven into every aspect of the development process.</p>\n<p>More code means a wider attack surface. And when that code is partially or fully generated, we can’t solely rely on secure coding practices or individual intuition to spot risks. That’s where automated scanning comes in. <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/\">Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/\">Software Composition Analysis (SCA)</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/\">Secret Detection</a> become critical controls to mitigate the risk of secret leaks, supply chain attacks, and weaknesses like SQL injections. With platforms like GitLab, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/security-compliance/\">application security</a> is natively built into the developer's workflow, making it a natural part of the development lifecycle. Scanners can also trace through the entire program to make sure new AI-generated code is secure <em>in the context of all the other code</em> — that can be hard to spot if you’re just looking at some new code in your IDE or in an AI-generated patch.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about scanning, it’s about keeping pace. If development teams are going to match the speed of AI-assisted development, they need scans that are fast, accurate, and built to scale. Accuracy especially matters. If scanners overwhelm developers with false positives, there’s a risk of losing trust in the system altogether.</p>\n<p>The only way to move fast <em>and</em> stay secure is to make scanning non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>Every commit. Every branch. No exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Secure your AI-generated code with GitLab</h2>\n<p>AI is changing the way we build software, but the fundamentals of secure software development still apply. Code still needs to be reviewed. Threats still need to be tested. And security still needs to be embedded in the way we work. At GitLab, that’s exactly what we’ve done.</p>\n<p>As a developer platform, we’re not bolting security onto the workflow — we’re embedding it directly where developers already work: in the IDE, in merge requests, and in the pipeline. Scans run automatically and relevant security context is surfaced to facilitate faster remediation cycles. And, because it’s part of the same platform where developers build, test, and deploy software, there are fewer tools to juggle, less context switching, and a much smoother path to secure code.</p>\n<p>AI features like <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/the-source/ai/understand-and-resolve-vulnerabilities-with-ai-powered-gitlab-duo/\">Duo Vulnerability Explanation and Vulnerability Resolution</a> add another layer of speed and insight, helping developers understand risks and fix them faster, without breaking their flow.</p>\n<p>AI isn’t a shortcut to security. But with the right practices — and a platform that meets developers where they are — it can absolutely be part of building software that’s fast, secure, and scalable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Start your <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">free 60-day trial of GitLab Ultimate with Duo Enterprise</a> and experience what it’s like to build secure software, faster. With native security scanning, AI-powered insights, and a seamless developer experience, GitLab helps you shift security left without slowing down.</p>\n</blockquote>",

By keeping infrastructure and cost management simple, the Hatch program enables startups to build tech solutions that make an impact.</p>\n<p>For Georgi Petrov and Mihail Stoychev, the co-founders and serial entrepreneurs behind <a href=\"http://uxify.com/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Uxify</a>, choosing DigitalOcean to host their startup’s infrastructure was a no-brainer. They built their previous ventures NitroPack, SMSBump, and iSenseLabs on DigitalOcean and could trust the platform’s simplicity, reliability, and user experience. When it came time to power Uxify’s AI-enabled website performance solution and AI agent Uxi, they opted for DigitalOcean again  With Hatch program benefits like cloud credits and GPU Droplet discounts, Uxify could focus on building and scaling their underlying AI infrastructure.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"building-beyond-the-original-blueprint\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#building-beyond-the-original-blueprint\">Building beyond the original blueprint</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#building-beyond-the-original-blueprint\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Uxify’s story begins over a decade ago with iSenseLabs, an agency that provided services but also built and sold its own products. One of those products was NitroPack, a performance optimization tool designed to help websites load faster. As NitroPack gained traction, the team began seeing possibilities beyond their current solution.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2024, the team behind NitroPack reached a pivotal moment. They began rethinking web performance and user’s perception of site responsiveness… This new philosophy led them to develop Navigation AI, a performance solution focused on user experience rather than purely technical metrics. Around the same time, NitroPack was acquired by WP Engine. As part of that acquisition, the emerging Navigation AI project was spun out into a new company: Uxify.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"the-cloud-platform-they-trust-again-and-again\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#the-cloud-platform-they-trust-again-and-again\">The cloud platform they trust, again and again</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#the-cloud-platform-they-trust-again-and-again\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>When they built their first venture iSenseLabs in 2012, Petrov and Stoychev chose DigitalOcean to host their cloud infrastructure. Impressed by the products’ ease of use and deployment, the duo knew that they had found the right cloud provider for their startups. Today, they employ a full suite of DigitalOcean products including Droplets, GPU Droplets, Managed Kubernetes, and Load Balancers.</p>\n<p>“As a startup, time to market is essential and the simplicity of DigitalOcean cut all the noise and removed a lot of bureaucracy compared to some of the other providers. DigitalOcean has been amazing. It has always been there, always reliable, always predictable, and always easy to track what is going on. In the rare cases where we have something that is going off the charts, it’s easy to understand where the issue is and fix it.”</p>\n<p>— Georgi Petrov, CEO @ Uxify</p>\n<p>Uxify also isn’t Petrov and Stoychev’s first startup to go through the Hatch program. While building NitroPack, their venture capital investor, <a href=\"https://www.11.vc/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eleven</a>, informed them that they had an offering with the Hatch program. After reaping the benefits of the program the first time, they decided to apply for the Hatch program again with Uxify. The credits provided by the Hatch program allowed them to experiment with their infrastructure for both NitroPack and Uxify without worrying about costs during the pre-revenue phase of their businesses.</p>\n<p>Why DigitalOcean? According to Petrov, DigitalOcean has always been startup-friendly. Back in 2018, they were asked to be a part of DigitalOcean’s Kubernetes beta program. “DigitalOcean was very responsive in listening to feedback and improving the solution, which is why we continue to use it,” says Petrov.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"chasing-purpose-not-profit\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#chasing-purpose-not-profit\">Chasing purpose, not profit</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#chasing-purpose-not-profit\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Founding a startup involves countless sleepless nights, putting out operational fires, and an abundance  of caffeine. Although it’s challenging, Petrov continues founding companies because he enjoys creating value for others.</p>\n<p>“After the first major acquisition with SMSBump, we felt a little bit empty. It’s a lifetime achievement. It’s a milestone. You get somewhere and you say, ‘Okay, I know I should be a successful guy,’ but actually, you feel a little bit empty because you stop the day-to-day thinking of how to create more value for someone else,” says Petrov. “After a few months of feeling that way, we said, ‘okay, we need to continue to being useful for others.’”</p>\n<p>Uxify is moving toward its full launch to bring performance insights to website owners everywhere. By joining the Hatch program, founders like Petrov and Stoychev are able to build, experiment, and scale, developing products that delight and create value for their customers.</p>\n<p>Startups accepted into Hatch receive*:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Up to $100,000 in compute credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privilege GradientAI NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplet pricing of $1.90/hour/GPU</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privilege GradientAI NVIDIA H100 GPU Kubernetes pricing of $1.90/hour/node</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3 months of free GPU usage for select startups</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complimentary Standard-tier support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GradientAI Platform usage with Hatch credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to a thriving community of founders and builders</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Note that GPU Droplet, GPU Kubernetes, and Bare Metal usage will not be covered by Hatch compute credits.

      "summary": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_-6V9xGQM6vGmsiD_dNEog.png\" /></figure><p>The results of the 2025 Argo CD user survey are in! We had a fantastic response, with 185 submissions, which shows the community is more engaged than ever.</p><p>This year, our goal was to capture a well-rounded view of how folks use Argo CD. We strive to stay closely connected to our users, understand where we’re excelling, and identify current pain points so we can prioritize improvements and proactively address community needs.</p><p>This year’s theme is environment promotion, as it has emerged as one of the most significant pain points currently experienced by Argo CD users.</p><p>Here’s what we learned.</p><h4>TL;DR</h4><p>Argo CD is growing fast and becoming a standard for deployments to production!</p><p>Compared to 2023, significantly more organizations rely on it in production. Over 60% of respondents have been actively using it in Production for more than 2 years. Patterns like ApplicationSets and self-healing have become widely adopted. Argo CD is increasingly being used at scale, with instances managing more applications, often spanning multiple clusters. We can expect scalability and performance to become the pressure points, as well as growing interest in enterprise-like capabilities from the community.</p><p>Environment promotion is where things start to get tricky. Most teams still lean on custom scripts or manual steps to get the job done. Many organizations seek solutions to improve traceability and visibility, and to standardize workflows across environments. We will likely see more maturity and new capabilities in this area.</p><p>We’re also seeing more applications under management overall, with organizations connecting more clusters to each Argo CD instance, yet still running just one to five instances. This trend points to growing pressure on instance scalability and performance.</p><p>A few more highlights from the results:</p><ul><li>Argo Labs projects like Argo CD Image Updater, Argo CD Operator, and Argo CD Vault Plugin are gaining traction, reflecting a push toward automation.</li><li>Helm is by far the most popular Argo CD installation method.</li><li>Platform engineers now make up a larger share of the community, reflecting broader organizational shifts.</li></ul><h4>What do developers really think of Argo CD?</h4><p>We kicked off the survey by asking users how likely they were to recommend Argo CD to others — one of the simplest ways to get a feel for overall satisfaction.</p><p>The 2025 result? Overwhelmingly positive 🎉 Even more users this year said they’d recommend Argo CD compared to an already strong showing in 2023. That shift says a lot about how far the tool has come and the growing trust the community has in it. In fact, Argo CD achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 79 — an increase of 3 points from two years ago — highlighting exceptional user satisfaction!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZY4tGNGXZGrHgLfn\" /></figure><p>We were overwhelmed by the encouraging and positive comments, reflecting just how much people love the project and deeply value the vibrant Argo community. Here’s what some users had to say:</p><blockquote><em>“Argo CD is incredible, I have no idea how we survived without it in the past.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Thanks for this great tool ❤️”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re awesome!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Please keep going!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Keep up the good work! :)”</em></blockquote><p>We asked which features users find most valuable. The winners?</p><ul><li>ApplicationSets</li><li>Argo CD’s intuitive UI</li></ul><p>Together, they make it much easier to manage and visualise complex deployments.</p><p>Also mentioned: auto-sync, drift detection, rollbacks, RBAC, multi-source support, and integrations.</p><h4>Who’s using Argo CD these days?</h4><p>The community remains consistent and is made up mostly of DevOps and platform engineers, but platform engineers have grown from 25% in 2023 to 37% in 2025. DevOps engineers declined slightly from 43% to 36%. This shift likely reflects the broader industry trend toward adopting a platform mindset, resulting in increased demand for dedicated platform engineering roles. Roles like architects and SREs remained steady.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZXUJ5osL9R28zoUn\" /></figure><h4>What does adoption look like in 2025?</h4><p>With the adoption being consistently high, 93% of respondents use Argo CD in production in 2023 and 97% in 2025, the implementation maturity grows significantly. In 2023, only 28% had used Argo CD in production for over 2 years. In 2025, that number jumped to 60%, and fewer than 10% were still evaluating or in early phases.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e0xsvHzotjrhkIYg\" /></figure><p>Almost 60% of respondents said that 75% or more of their production applications now run on Kubernetes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gWqJBdpN4BHjbFFs\" /></figure><p>As Kubernetes adoption deepens, Argo CD has become an essential part of the CI/CD infrastructure. As more organizations rely on Argo CD, we’ll likely see continued investment from both the community and vendors, as well as more contributors joining the project.</p><p>When it comes to Argo CD installation, Helm is by far the top choice, followed by tools like Kustomize and Terraform. Interesting to note: 19% use cluster-wide installs versus just 10% using namespace-scoped ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x4RJRiUclqZg-VgN\" /></figure><h4>What does the Argo CD footprint look like?</h4><p>The most noticeable trend is the growing number of applications. Organizations are managing bigger setups with fewer, larger instances.</p><p>In 2023, just over 15% managed more than 500 Applications; by 2025, this rose to 42%. Notably, these numbers don’t correlate with how long organizations have used Argo CD and how many applications they have.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eRwUqAp_3dbairfo\" /></figure><p>The number of Argo CD instances is growing compared to 2023, but the increase is not as significant as the rise in the number of applications. In 2023, 77% of respondents reported having fewer than 6 instances, while this percentage fell to 64% in 2025. Nevertheless, most organizations still use only a handful of instances.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q_ePbizmF7pE04-k\" /></figure><p>Even though the number of Argo CD instances hasn’t changed much, the number of applications certainly has! This means each instance is likely connecting to more clusters. For example, back in 2023, about 42% of instances were linked to one Kubernetes cluster. Fast forward to 2025, and that number has dropped to 25%. At the same time, the share of instances connecting to more than 20 clusters has jumped significantly, going from 5% to 25%.</p><p>In summary, organizations manage a significantly larger number of applications, with more clusters connected to a single Argo CD instance, typically keeping the number of instances between 1 and 5.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the community and the project? Well, it seems that managing lots of Argo CD instances might not be the biggest hurdle for most teams. Instead, the real pressure points are around scalability and performance as organizations push Argo CD to handle more clusters and Applications. Users are already calling out these challenges, and they’re likely to become even more important moving forward. The good news? Some of this work is already underway.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Interested in how to scale Argo CD? Take a look at the </em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-agent\"><em>argocd-agent project</em></a><em> or read an </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\"><em>article about scaling up Argo CD</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to contribute to measuring and improving Argo scalability, take a look at the Scalability special interest group (</em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/main/sigs/sig-scalability\"><em>Argo SIG Scalability</em></a><em>).</em></p><h4>What patterns and tools are catching on?</h4><p>More and more teams are following Argo CD’s recommended practices. App-of-Apps, ApplicationSets, and built-in self-healing are now widely used to manage complex GitOps setups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG5_7BB_xx5xn1U_\" /></figure><p>We also asked about sub-projects, an area that shows the ecosystem dynamics. The most used are:</p><ul><li>Argo CD Image Updater</li><li>Argo CD Operator</li><li>Argo CD Vault Plugin</li></ul><p>Like the patterns mentioned earlier, the popularity of these Argo Labs projects reflects growing efforts to make Argo CD implementations more structured and automation-friendly.</p><p><em>ℹ️ You can manage secrets with </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/secret-management/#secret-management\"><em>Kubernetes operators</em></a><em>, one of the recommended ways of managing secrets on the destination cluster. This keeps Argo CD out of direct secret management, helping avoid accidental updates and reducing the risk of leaks.</em></p><p>Image Updater is the most adopted sub-project (used by 34% of respondents). While still under active development and intended for non-critical environments, its popularity shows just how hungry teams are for better deployment and promotion automation.</p><p>But Image Updater only solves part of the deployment automation puzzle. There’s still no go-to comprehensive solution out there. We’ll explore this further in the next section on environment promotion.</p><h4>Environment promotion</h4><p>Given how widely Argo CD is used in production, we wanted to explore how teams handle environment promotion. Is it a pain point for GitOps users? And how do their approaches compare to the more traditional promotion strategies used on other platforms?</p><p>First, we looked at the number of environments teams work with. Now, most respondents use 3 or fewer. Only 12% reported having more than 8.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lwhiMHHc0r41nELe\" /></figure><p>This introduces complexity, as teams must coordinate across multiple instances. And that’s where challenges like consistent observability start to show up.</p><p>To dig deeper into this, we asked teams about their biggest pain points. What came up most?</p><ul><li>Traceability across environments, what version of a deployed app is running where (51%)</li><li>Release gates (44%)</li><li>Understanding app health and status across environments (37%)</li><li>Keeping pipeline definitions consistent (36%)</li><li>Troubleshooting failed promotions (29%)</li></ul><p>Most teams reported multiple challenges, with traceability and release gates often mentioned together.</p><p>To understand what drives these challenges, we asked how teams promote applications across environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IV4zO6ktxeE6AFz0\" /></figure><p>The most common setup is DIY. Around 67% use scripts, in-house tools, or both.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of teams handle promotions solely through manual manifest updates, and almost half use some form of manual step, often paired with scripts.</p><p>So, how can we make sense of this combination? One possibility is that teams are using Argo CD Image Updater, currently the most popular sub-project, for simple, image-only updates. For more complex tasks, like updating configuration files, many might rely on manual steps. In other words, automation helps with the easy stuff, but more involved changes still need hands-on work.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Manual manifest updates are often where teams start with Argo CD. They can work well for small setups, like a few static infrastructure manifests.</em></p><p><em>But as you scale, they tend to fall short. It’s easy to run into slower deployments, more manual overhead, and challenges around security and compliance. If you’re growing with Argo CD, it’s worth moving toward full CI/CD automation to keep things on track.</em></p><p>A few out-of-the-box solutions for automated environment promotion are starting to show up in the survey. The most mentioned, though still only used by 4% of respondents, is <a href=\"https://argo-gitops-promoter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">GitOps Promoter</a>. It’s part of the Argo CD ecosystem and works alongside <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/proposals/manifest-hydrator/\">Hydrator</a> to handle promotions via pull requests. Others mentioned Codefresh GitOps and Kargo.</p><p>Here’s how one person summed it up:</p><blockquote><em>“Some sort of environment promotion. Lots of players in the game now and it’s hard to settle on one. Lots of manual reviews required for manifest changes that can be tiresome to compare against other environments. Some sort of environment comparison tool would be good.”</em></blockquote><p>That quote really captures where things stand. Plenty is happening in this space, but no clear winner or standard approach just yet. As more teams adopt Argo CD and take on more advanced deployment setups, tackling challenges like traceability, testing, and consistent configuration will only become more important.</p><p>This is definitely a space to watch. Expect more tooling, more investment, and, hopefully, comprehensive user-friendly solutions soon.</p><h4>What challenges are teams facing?</h4><p>After digging into environment promotion, we zoomed out and asked about broader challenges, too.</p><p>Nearly 30% of respondents said they had no major challenges with Argo CD, which is a great sign.</p><p>The most common challenge, flagged by 37%, was environment modeling and promotion workflows (covered earlier).</p><p>Other pain points included:</p><ul><li>Troubleshooting deployments and app issues (25%)</li><li>Too much manual work or not enough automation (23%)</li><li>Limited visibility into deployment status (16%)</li></ul><h4>What features are missing?</h4><p>To wrap up, we asked what users think is missing from Argo CD. Many of the responses built on earlier themes.</p><p>Some areas users want to see improved:</p><ul><li>Support for promoting apps through stages and managing service dependencies.</li><li>Better templating in ApplicationSets, progressive syncs, and built-in promotion workflows.</li><li>Multi-cluster visibility and faster UI performance.</li><li>Enterprise-grade features like fine-grained RBAC, audit trails, Vault and Prometheus integrations, and better error messages.</li></ul><p>As teams scale up, these requests point toward a natural next step: evolving Argo CD into a full-featured, enterprise-ready platform.</p><h4>Final words</h4><p>The 2025 survey gave us a ton to think about. We saw just how far Argo CD has come, what’s working well, and what needs more attention. All these insights are gold for the project’s future evolution.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to share feedback!</p><p>Special shoutout to those who offered to help with case studies, blog posts, talks, or quotes.

With v3.1, the first batch of features comes out of the gate; featuring <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">OCI</a> support, CLI Plugins, Hydrator updates, UI improvements, plus much more.</p><p>Along with new features, this release comes with a whole slew of security fixes, bug fixes, and general quality of life improvements.</p><p>You can download the v3.1 Release Candidate on the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.1.0-rc1\">Argo CD Releases Page</a>!</p><p>We are really excited to have you try out the new features and look forward to any feedback from the border community! With that, let’s dive into what this release holds!</p><h3>OCI Support</h3><p>Argo CD has supported obtaining Kubernetes manifests from either a Git repository, a Helm chart repository, and later support for getting manifests from a Helm chart stored within an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry. As OCI registries have more frequently been used to store content aside from container images, more and more projects have been adding support for using OCI as a storage mechanism and a source of truth.</p><p>Starting with Argo CD v3.1, we now support OCI by enabling the use of OCI-compliant container registries as sources for configuration artifacts. This means Argo CD can pull Kubernetes manifests packaged as OCI artifacts from registries that follow the OCI image and distribution specifications. This enhances security and portability, as it allows users to leverage the same registries they use for container images to also store and distribute deployment configurations. Argo CD OCI support comes into beta with this release.</p><p>BIG thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">@blakepettersson</a> from Akuity for leading this effort!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements</h3><p>Manifest changes are often just image tag bumps. For example, the manifest change associated with a code change. The manifest hydrator writes metadata to the hydrated branch to associate the hydrated commit back to its corresponding dry commit.</p><p>Starting in v3.1, the Hydrator now allows for a way to associate a dry commit with a code commit. This is done by adding information about the upstream repo url, that commit SHA hash, the author of that commit, and any messages associated with that code commit. This information is then added to the Hydrator manifest metadata; this enables future work to be able to display this metadata in the Argo CD UI.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a> from Intuit for this improvement.</p><h3>Server-Side Apply Stabilization</h3><p>Argo CD now supports client-side apply migration, which helps transitioning from client-side apply to server-side apply by moving a resource’s managed fields from one manager to Argo CD’s manager. This feature is particularly useful when you need to migrate existing resources that were created using kubectl client-side apply to server-side apply with Argo CD. You can also specify your own field manager to migrate from using an annotation. This is useful when you have other operators managing resources that are no longer in use and would like Argo CD to own all the fields for that operator.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">@pjiang-dev</a> from Intuit for this contribution.</p><h3>UI Parameterized Action</h3><p>The Argo CD UI in many ways is the first Kubernetes dashboard, providing not only a UI for GitOps users; but also a feature rich UI for Kubernetes end users. In this release, we’ve added the ability to perform additional action on Kubernetes resources, beyond just deleting.</p><p>This feature enables users to scale resources directly from the Argo CD UI. Users will be able to increase or decrease the number of replicas (Pods) for Deployments and StatefulSets by using an input field. The feature aims to enhance user experience, especially for non-technical users, by eliminating the need to modify configuration files or use kubectl commands for scaling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7C4pCbBqylNOEFKm\" /><figcaption>Scaling resource from Argo CD UI</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ratulbasak\">@ratulbasak</a> from Deutsche Bank for contributing!</p><h3>And We Didn’t Stop There</h3><p>There are other notable updates/improvements in this release.</p><ul><li>Similar to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/\">kubectl plugin mechanism</a>, support for <em>argocd</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20074\">CLI plugins</a> is available in this release. — <a href=\"https://github.com/nitishfy\">@nitishify</a></li><li>You can now <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22482\">explicitly set auto-sync</a> on an Application — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li>The sync option <em>SkipDryRunOnMissingResource</em> was only available as an annotation before; now you can set this as an Application sync option — <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">@pasha-codefresh</a></li><li>Improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22781\">AppSet Progressive Sync in the UI</a>, paving the path for it to enter Beta — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23057\">Add cooldown</a> to prevent resetting autoheal exp backoff preemptively — <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">@gdsoumya</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22864\">Added GitHub API metrics</a> to better debug rate limiting — <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a></li></ul><h3>Dependency, Platform, and Security Updates</h3><p>Some notable dependency, platform, and security updates included in v3.1</p><p><strong>Go 1.24.4</strong></p><ul><li>All builds, CI, and images now use the latest Go.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features.

      "summary": "<h3><strong>Argo CD v2.14</strong></h3><p>We are thrilled to announce the release of Argo CD 2.14, packed with new features, bug fixes, and documentation updates to enhance your experience.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in Argo CD 2.14. As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

#56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI plugin incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod, which had been deleted, to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurred, ztunnel would not be able to become ready.

If you don&rsquo;t do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.</p>\n<p>We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.</p>",

Please note that <em><code>EnvoyFilter</code> is not currently supported for any existing Istio version with waypoint proxies</em>. While it may be possible to use <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with waypoints in limited scenarios, its use is not supported, and is actively discouraged by the maintainers. The alpha API may break in future releases as it evolves. We expect official support will be provided at a later date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"customization-of-resources-provisioned-by-the-gateway-api\">Customization of resources provisioned by the Gateway API</h3>\n<p>When you create a Gateway or a waypoint using the Gateway API, a <code>Service</code> and a <code>Deployment</code> are created automatically. It has been a common request to allow customization of these objects, and that is now supported in Istio 1.26 by specifying a <code>ConfigMap</code> of parameters. If configuration for a <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code> or <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code> is provided, those resources will automatically be created also. <a href=\"/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Learn more about customizing the generated Gateway API resources.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"new-gateway-api-support\">New Gateway API support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/\"><code>TCPRoute</code></a> is now available in waypoints, allowing TCP traffic shifting in ambient mode.</p>\n<p>We also added support for the experimental <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtlspolicy/\"><code>BackendTLSPolicy</code></a> and started the implementation of <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtrafficpolicy/\"><code>BackendTrafficPolicy</code></a> in Gateway API 1.3, which will eventually set retry constraints.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-the-new-kubernetes-clustertrustbundle\">Support for the new Kubernetes <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code></h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve added experimental support for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#cluster-trust-bundles\">the experimental <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> resource in Kubernetes</a>, allowing support for the new method of bundling a certificate and its root of trust into a single object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plus-much-much-more\">Plus much, much more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>istioctl analyze</code> can now run specific checks!</li>\n<li>The CNI node agent no longer runs in the <code>hostNetwork</code> namespace by default, reducing the chance of port conflicts with other services running on a host!</li>\n<li>Required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources and <code>cniBinDir</code> values are set automatically when installing on GKE!</li>\n<li>An <code>EnvoyFilter</code> can now match a <code>VirtualHost</code> on a domain name!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read about these and more in the full <a href=\"/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/change-notes/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"catch-up-with-the-istio-project\">Catch up with the Istio project</h2>\n<p>If you only check in with us when we have a new release, you might have missed that <a href=\"/blog/2025/ztunnel-security-assessment/\">we published a security audit on ztunnel</a>, <a href=\"/blog/2025/ambient-performance/\">we compared performance of ambient mode throughput vs. running in-kernel</a>, or that <a href=\"/blog/2025/istio-at-kubecon-eu/\">we had a major presence at KubeCon EU</a>.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the CNI agent to no longer require <code>hostNetwork</code>, enhancing compatibility. Dynamic switching to the host network is now performed as needed. The previous behavior can be temporarily restored by setting the <code>ambient.shareHostNetworkNamespace</code> field in the <code>istio-cni</code> chart. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54726\">Issue #54726</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> iptables binary detection to validate baseline kernel support and to prefer <code>nft</code> when both legacy and <code>nft</code> are available but neither has existing rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the default value of maximum connections accepted per socket event to 1 to improve performance. To revert to the previous behavior, set <code>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SOCKET_EVENT_LOOP</code> to zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability for <code>EnvoyFilter</code> to match a <code>VirtualHost</code> by domain name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> initial support for the experimental Gateway API features <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> and <code>XBackendTrafficPolicy</code>. These are disabled by default and require setting <code>PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for referencing <code>ConfigMap</code>s, in addition to <code>Secret</code>s, for <code>DestinationRule</code> TLS in <code>SIMPLE</code> mode — useful when only a CA certificate is required.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> customization support for <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Gateway API automated deployments</a>. This applies to both Istio <code>Gateway</code> types (ingress and egress) and Istio Waypoint <code>Gateway</code> types (ambient waypoints). Users can now customize generated resources such as <code>Service</code>, <code>Deployment</code>, <code>ServiceAccount</code>, <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code>, and <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new environment variable <code>ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT</code> for <code>istiod</code>.

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting! In this post, we walked through the new cases that emerged like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>edge clusters</li>\n<li>limited access networks</li>\n<li>large number of clusters</li>\n<li>ephemeral and dynamic clusters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We then explained the new Prometheus Agent mode that allows efficiently forwarding scraped metrics to the remote write endpoints.</p>\n<p>As always, if you have any issues or feedback, feel free to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">submit a ticket on GitHub or ask questions on the mailing list</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This blog post is part of a coordinated release between CNCF, Grafana, and Prometheus.

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>. In the spirit of End User confidence, we decided to track their results while they position themselves as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.</p>\n<h3>aaS</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronosphere</li>\n<li>Grafana Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>New Relic</li>\n<li>Sysdig Monitor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: As Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on Cortex just like Grafana Cloud, we expect them to pass after the next update cycle.</p>\n<h2>Agent/Collector</h2>\n<h3>Passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafana Agent 0.19.0</li>\n<li>OpenTelemetry Collector 0.37.0</li>\n<li>Prometheus 2.30.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Telegraf 1.20.2</li>\n<li>Timber Vector 0.16.1</li>\n<li>VictoriaMetrics Agent 1.67.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: We tested Vector 0.16.1 instead of 0.17.0 because there are no binary downloads for 0.17.0 and our test toolchain currently expects binaries.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
