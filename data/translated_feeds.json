      "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>As the release of Kubernetes v1.33 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.33 release and is subject to change before the final release date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kubernetes-api-removal-and-deprecation-process\">The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes project has a well-documented <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">deprecation policy</a> for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable, or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/\">deprecation guide</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deprecations-and-removals-for-kubernetes-v1-33\">Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.33</h2>\n<h3 id=\"deprecation-of-the-stable-endpoints-api\">Deprecation of the stable Endpoints API</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/\">EndpointSlices</a> API has been stable since v1.21, which effectively replaced the original Endpoints API. While the original Endpoints API was simple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network endpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making the original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.</p>\n<p>This deprecation only impacts those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts; these users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with more details on the deprecation implications and migration plans in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4974\">KEP-4974: Deprecate v1.Endpoints</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-kube-proxy-version-information-in-node-status\">Removal of kube-proxy version information in node status</h3>\n<p>Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/07/19/kubernetes-1-31-upcoming-changes/#deprecation-of-status-nodeinfo-kubeproxyversion-field-for-nodes-kep-4004-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-4004\">release announcement</a>, the <code>status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion</code> field will be removed in v1.33. This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate. As it has been disabled by default since v1.31, the v1.33 release will remove this field entirely.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4004\">KEP-4004: Deprecate status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"removal-of-host-network-support-for-windows-pods\">Removal of host network support for Windows pods</h3>\n<p>Windows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density by allowing containers to use the Node’s networking namespace.\nThe original implementation landed as alpha with v1.26, but as it faced unexpected containerd behaviours,\nand alternative solutions were available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated\nKEP. We're expecting to see support fully removed in v1.33.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3503\">KEP-3503: Host network support for Windows pods</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"featured-improvement-of-kubernetes-v1-33\">Featured improvement of Kubernetes v1.33</h2>\n<p>As authors of this article, we picked one improvement as the most significant change to call out!</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-user-namespaces-within-linux-pods\">Support for user namespaces within Linux Pods</h3>\n<p>One of the oldest open KEPs today is <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127</a>, Pod security improvement by using Linux <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/user-namespaces/\">User namespaces</a> for Pods. This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and now is set to be a part of v1.33, where the feature is available by default.</p>\n<p>This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify <code>pod.spec.hostUsers</code> to opt in. As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/03/12/kubernetes-1-30-upcoming-changes/\">v1.30 sneak peek blog</a>, this is an important milestone for mitigating vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127: Support User Namespaces in pods</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"selected-other-kubernetes-v1-33-improvements\">Selected other Kubernetes v1.33 improvements</h2>\n<p>The following list of enhancements is likely to be included in the upcoming v1.33 release. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-place-resource-resize-for-vertical-scaling-of-pods\">In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of Pods</h3>\n<p>When provisioning a Pod, you can use various resources such as Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. Scalability requirements may need horizontal scaling by updating the Pod replica count, or vertical scaling by updating resources allocated to Pod’s container(s). Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's <code>spec</code> were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.</p>\n<p>But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287</a> is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It opens up various possibilities of vertical scale-up for stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup that is eventually reduced once the initial setup is complete. This was released as alpha in v1.27, and is expected to land as beta in v1.33.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-Place Update of Pod Resources</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-s-resourceclaim-device-status-graduates-to-beta\">DRA’s ResourceClaim Device Status graduates to beta</h3>\n<p>The <code>devices</code> field in ResourceClaim <code>status</code>, originally introduced in the v1.32 release, is likely to graduate to beta in v1.33. This field allows drivers to report device status data, improving both observability and troubleshooting capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, reporting the interface name, MAC address, and IP addresses of network interfaces in the status of a ResourceClaim can significantly help in configuring and managing network services, as well as in debugging network related issues. You can read more about ResourceClaim Device Status in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#resourceclaim-device-status\">Dynamic Resource Allocation: ResourceClaim Device Status</a> document.</p>\n<p>Also, you can find more about the planned enhancement in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4817\">KEP-4817: DRA: Resource Claim Status with possible standardized network interface data</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ordered-namespace-deletion\">Ordered namespace deletion</h3>\n<p>This KEP introduces a more structured deletion process for Kubernetes namespaces to ensure secure and deterministic resource removal. The current semi-random deletion order can create security gaps or unintended behaviour, such as Pods persisting after their associated NetworkPolicies are deleted. By enforcing a structured deletion sequence that respects logical and security dependencies, this approach ensures Pods are removed before other resources. The design improves Kubernetes’s security and reliability by mitigating risks associated with non-deterministic deletions.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5080\">KEP-5080: Ordered namespace deletion</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enhancements-for-indexed-job-management\">Enhancements for indexed job management</h3>\n<p>These two KEPs are both set to graduate to GA to provide better reliability for job handling, specifically for indexed jobs. <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850</a> provides per-index backoff limits for indexed jobs, which allows each index to be fully independent of other indexes. Also, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998</a> extends Job API to define conditions for making an indexed job as successfully completed when not all indexes are succeeded.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3850\">KEP-3850: Backoff Limit Per Index For Indexed Jobs</a> and <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3998\">KEP-3998: Job success/completion policy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-know-more\">Want to know more?</h2>\n<p>New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes. We will formally announce what's new in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md\">Kubernetes v1.33</a> as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 release is planned for <strong>Wednesday, 23rd April, 2025</strong>.

      "summary": "<p>Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature.\nIt offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by\nswapping out unused data,\nshielding nodes from system-level memory spikes,\npreventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits,\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2400-node-swap/README.md#user-stories\">much more</a>.\nAs a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project\nhas invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes.</p>\n<p>The 1.22 release <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/09/run-nodes-with-swap-alpha/\">introduced</a> Alpha support\nfor configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.\nLater, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many\nnew improvements.\nIn the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way\nto GA in the near future.</p>\n<p>Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.\nThis was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization\nwhen swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial\ndesign of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory\nwas detected on a node.</p>\n<p>In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage.\nThis provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time.\nHowever, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.</p>\n<p>In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta.\nThe Beta version was a drastic leap forward.\nNot only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way,\nbut it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests\nwhich include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more.\nIt also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the <code>LimitedSwap</code> behavior\nwhich sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation\nsupport (through the <code>/metrics/resource</code> endpoint) and Summary API for\nVerticalPodAutoscalers (through the <code>/stats/summary</code> endpoint), and more.</p>\n<p>Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA.\nCurrently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability,\nenhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback,\npolishing the feature and making it stable.\nFor example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods\ncannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use.\nIn addition, the <code>UnlimitedSwap</code> behavior was removed since it might compromise\nthe node's health.\nSecret content protection against swapping has also been introduced\n(see relevant <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#memory-backed-volumes\">security-risk section</a> for more info).</p>\n<p>To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled\nis more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings.\nThat said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning.\nIn the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways,\nsuch as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the <code>failSwapOn</code>\nfield must be set to <code>false</code> on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated\n<code>--fail-swap-on</code> command line flag must be deactivated.</p>\n<p>It is possible to configure the <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code> option to define the\nmanner in which a node utilizes swap memory.\nFor instance,</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># this fragment goes into the kubelet's configuration file</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">memorySwap</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">swapBehavior</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>LimitedSwap<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The currently available configuration options for <code>swapBehavior</code> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>NoSwap</code> (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap.

We plan to remove this warning in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-the-swap-limit-being-determined-with-limitedswap\">How is the swap limit being determined with LimitedSwap?</h2>\n<p>The configuration of swap memory, including its limitations, presents a significant\nchallenge. Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any\nmisconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific\nworkload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented\nSwap with automatic configuration of limitations.</p>\n<p>With <code>LimitedSwap</code>, Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.\n<code>BestEffort</code>/<code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.\n<code>BestEffort</code> QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack\ninformation regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe\nallocation of swap memory.\nConversely, <code>Guaranteed</code> QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the\nprecise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.\nTo maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,\nthese Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when <code>LimitedSwap</code> is in effect.\nIn addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory\nthey consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.</p>\n<p>Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nodeTotalMemory</code>: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.</li>\n<li><code>totalPodsSwapAvailable</code>: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).</li>\n<li><code>containerMemoryRequest</code>: The container's memory request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap limitation is configured as:\n<code>(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) × totalPodsSwapAvailable</code></p>\n<p>In other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its\nmemory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on\nthe node that is available for use by Pods.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to\nopt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.\nContainers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.\nWhen swap is already provisioned and available on a node,\nthe kubelet is able to be configured so that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can start with swap on.</li>\n<li>It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory\nto Kubernetes workloads by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1/\"><code>memorySwap</code> in the KubeletConfiguration</a>.\nAs a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the\npresence of swap memory by setting <code>memorySwap.swapBehavior</code>.</p>\n<p>The kubelet employs the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/\">CRI</a>\n(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to\nconfigure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as <code>memory.swap.max</code>) in a manner that will\nenable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,\nthe container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-monitor-swap\">How can I monitor swap?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"node-and-container-level-metric-statistics\">Node and container level metric statistics</h3>\n<p>Kubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,\nwhich can be accessed at the <code>/metrics/resource</code> (which is used mainly by monitoring\ntools like Prometheus) and <code>/stats/summary</code> (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.\nThis allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to\nmonitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using <code>LimitedSwap</code>.\nAdditionally, a <code>machine_swap_bytes</code> metric has been added to cadvisor to show\nthe total physical swap capacity of the machine.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/\">this page</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery\">Node Feature Discovery</a>\nis a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.\nIt can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.</p>\n<p>As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,\nuse the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get nodes -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">'{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap)]}{.metadata.name}{\"\\t\"}{.metadata.labels.feature\\.node\\.kubernetes\\.io/memory-swap}{\"\\n\"}{end}'</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will result in an output similar to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>k8s-worker1: true\nk8s-worker2: true\nk8s-worker3: false\n</code></pre><p>In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes <code>k8s-worker1</code> and <code>k8s-worker2</code>, but not on <code>k8s-worker3</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\n<p>Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.\nWhile swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data\nback to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,\nwhich can cause unexpected performance regressions.\nFurthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.\nEnabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,\nwhere Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.\nIn addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,\nand due to unexpected packing configurations,\nthe scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.\nThis heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.\nWhen swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O\noperations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with\nI/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives\nor NVMe.\nAs swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency\npriority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">recommended practices</a> section below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-backed-volumes\">Memory-backed volumes</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\"><code>secret</code></a>\nvolume mounts, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir\"><code>emptyDir</code></a> with <code>medium: Memory</code>)\nare implemented with a <code>tmpfs</code> filesystem.\nThe contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should\nnot be swapped to disk.\nTo ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the <code>noswap</code> tmpfs option\nis being used.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel officially supports the <code>noswap</code> option from version 6.3 (more info\ncan be found in <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/node/kernel-version-requirements/#requirements-other\">Linux Kernel Version Requirements</a>).\nHowever, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older\nLinux versions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to verify whether the node supports the <code>noswap</code> option, the kubelet will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the <code>noswap</code> option will be assumed to be supported.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the <code>noswap</code> option at startup.\nIf kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option, <code>noswap</code> will be assumed\nto not be supported, hence will not be used.\nA kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.\nIf kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the <code>noswap</code> option will be used.\n<ul>\n<li>If the <code>noswap</code> option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,\nthen continue its execution.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.\nSee the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#setting-up-encrypted-swap\">section above</a> with an example for setting unencrypted swap.\nHowever, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;\nrather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.\nIt is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"good-practice-for-using-swap-in-a-kubernetes-cluster\">Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-swap-for-system-critical-daemons\">Disable swap for system-critical daemons</h3>\n<p>During the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance\nof system-critical daemons and services might degrade.\nThis implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.\nIf this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice\nto prevent swapping (i.e., set <code>memory.swap.max=0</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-system-critical-daemons-for-i-o-latency\">Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latency</h3>\n<p>Swap can increase the I/O load on a node.\nWhen memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,\nsystem-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may\nexperience performance degradation.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.\nFor non-systemd users,\nsetting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.\nThis can be achieved by setting <code>io.latency</code> for the system slice,\nthereby granting it higher I/O priority.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst\">cgroup's documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3 id=\"swap-and-control-plane-nodes\">Swap and control plane nodes</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.\nThe control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.\nThe main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-a-dedicated-disk-for-swap\">Use of a dedicated disk for swap</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.\nIf swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere\nwith system processes that need to write to disk.\nWhen they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,\ndisrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.\nSince swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.\nAlternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,\npaving the way for a feature GA.\nHowever, this is just the beginning.\nIt's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.</p>\n<p>In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,\nincluding better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,\nbetter debug abilities and more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn

      "summary": "<p>Today, the ingress-nginx maintainers have <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases\">released patches for a batch of critical vulnerabilities</a> that could make it easy for attackers to take over your Kubernetes cluster. If you are among the over 40% of Kubernetes administrators using <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/\">ingress-nginx</a>, you should take action immediately to protect your users and data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">Ingress</a> is the traditional Kubernetes feature for exposing your workload Pods to the world so that they can be useful. In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/\">ingress controller</a> uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs.</p>\n<p>Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters!</p>\n<p>Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn’t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vulnerabilities-patched-today\">Vulnerabilities Patched Today</h2>\n<p>Four of today’s ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\">Secrets</a> that are accessible to ingress-nginx. By default, ingress-nginx has access to all Secrets cluster-wide, so this can often lead to complete cluster takeover by any user or entity that has permission to create an Ingress.</p>\n<p>The most serious of today’s vulnerabilities, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131009\">CVE-2025-1974</a>, rated <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3-1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\">9.8 CVSS</a>, allows anything on the Pod network to exploit configuration injection vulnerabilities via the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx. This makes such vulnerabilities far more dangerous: ordinarily one would need to be able to create an Ingress object in the cluster, which is a fairly privileged action. When combined with today’s other vulnerabilities, <strong>CVE-2025-1974 means that anything on the Pod network has a good chance of taking over your Kubernetes cluster, with no credentials or administrative access required</strong>. In many common scenarios, the Pod network is accessible to all workloads in your cloud VPC, or even anyone connected to your corporate network! This is a very serious situation.</p>\n<p>Today, we have <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases\">released ingress-nginx v1.12.1 and v1.11.5</a>, which have fixes for all five of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-next-steps\">Your next steps</h2>\n<p>First, determine if your clusters are using ingress-nginx. In most cases, you can check this by running <code>kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx</code> with cluster administrator permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are using ingress-nginx, make a plan to remediate these vulnerabilities immediately.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The best and easiest remedy is to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/\">upgrade to the new patch release of ingress-nginx</a>.</strong> All five of today’s vulnerabilities are fixed by installing today’s patches.</p>\n<p>If you can’t upgrade right away, you can significantly reduce your risk by turning off the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have installed ingress-nginx using Helm\n<ul>\n<li>Reinstall, setting the Helm value <code>controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=false</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you have installed ingress-nginx manually\n<ul>\n<li>delete the ValidatingWebhookconfiguration called <code>ingress-nginx-admission</code></li>\n<li>edit the <code>ingress-nginx-controller</code> Deployment or Daemonset, removing <code>--validating-webhook</code> from the controller container’s argument list</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you turn off the Validating Admission Controller feature as a mitigation for CVE-2025-1974, remember to turn it back on after you upgrade. This feature provides important quality of life improvements for your users, warning them about incorrect Ingress configurations before they can take effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-thanks-and-further-reading\">Conclusion, thanks, and further reading</h2>\n<p>The ingress-nginx vulnerabilities announced today, including CVE-2025-1974, present a serious risk to many Kubernetes users and their data. If you use ingress-nginx, you should take action immediately to keep yourself safe.</p>\n<p>Thanks go out to Nir Ohfeld, Sagi Tzadik, Ronen Shustin, and Hillai Ben-Sasson from Wiz for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities, and for working with the Kubernetes SRC members and ingress-nginx maintainers (Marco Ebert and James Strong) to ensure we fixed them effectively.</p>\n<p>For further information about the maintenance and future of ingress-nginx, please see this <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/13002\">GitHub issue</a> and/or attend <a href=\"https://kccnceu2025.sched.com/event/1tcyc/\">James and Marco’s KubeCon/CloudNativeCon EU 2025 presentation</a>.</p>\n<p>For further information about the specific vulnerabilities discussed in this article, please see the appropriate GitHub issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131005\">CVE-2025-24513</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131006\">CVE-2025-24514</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131007\">CVE-2025-1097</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131008\">CVE-2025-1098</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131009\">CVE-2025-1974</a></p>",

      "summary": "<p><strong>Authors</strong>: Daniel Vega-Myhre (Google), Abdullah Gharaibeh (Google), Kevin Hannon (Red Hat)</p>\n<p>In this article, we introduce <a href=\"https://jobset.sigs.k8s.io/\">JobSet</a>, an open source API for\nrepresenting distributed jobs. The goal of JobSet is to provide a unified API for distributed ML\ntraining and HPC workloads on Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-jobset\">Why JobSet?</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes community’s recent enhancements to the batch ecosystem on Kubernetes has attracted ML\nengineers who have found it to be a natural fit for the requirements of running distributed training\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>Large ML models (particularly LLMs) which cannot fit into the memory of the GPU or TPU chips on a\nsingle host are often distributed across tens of thousands of accelerator chips, which in turn may\nspan thousands of hosts.</p>\n<p>As such, the model training code is often containerized and executed simultaneously on all these\nhosts, performing distributed computations which often shard both the model parameters and/or the\ntraining dataset across the target accelerator chips, using communication collective primitives like\nall-gather and all-reduce to perform distributed computations and synchronize gradients between\nhosts.</p>\n<p>These workload characteristics make Kubernetes a great fit for this type of workload, as efficiently\nscheduling and managing the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of compute\nresources is an area where it shines.</p>\n<p>It is also very extensible, allowing developers to define their own Kubernetes APIs, objects, and\ncontrollers which manage the behavior and life cycle of these objects, allowing engineers to develop\ncustom distributed training orchestration solutions to fit their needs.</p>\n<p>However, as distributed ML training techniques continue to evolve, existing Kubernetes primitives do\nnot adequately model them alone anymore.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the landscape of Kubernetes distributed training orchestration APIs has become\nfragmented, and each of the existing solutions in this fragmented landscape has certain limitations\nthat make it non-optimal for distributed ML training.</p>\n<p>For example, the KubeFlow training operator defines custom APIs for different frameworks (e.g.\nPyTorchJob, TFJob, MPIJob, etc.); however, each of these job types are in fact a solution fit\nspecifically to the target framework, each with different semantics and behavior.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Job API fixed many gaps for running batch workloads, including Indexed\ncompletion mode, higher scalability, Pod failure policies and Pod backoff policy to mention a few of\nthe most recent enhancements. However, running ML training and HPC workloads using the upstream Job\nAPI requires extra orchestration to fill the following gaps:</p>\n<p>Multi-template Pods : Most HPC or ML training jobs include more than one type of Pods. The different\nPods are part of the same workload, but they need to run a different container, request different\nresources or have different failure policies. A common example is the driver-worker pattern.</p>\n<p>Job groups : Large scale training workloads span multiple network topologies, running across\nmultiple racks for example. Such workloads are network latency sensitive, and aim to localize\ncommunication and minimize traffic crossing the higher-latency network links. To facilitate this,\nthe workload needs to be split into groups of Pods each assigned to a network topology.</p>\n<p>Inter-Pod communication : Create and manage the resources (e.g. <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services\">headless\nServices</a>) necessary to establish\ncommunication between the Pods of a job.</p>\n<p>Startup sequencing : Some jobs require a specific start sequence of pods; sometimes the driver is\nexpected to start first (like Ray or Spark), in other cases the workers are expected to be ready\nbefore starting the driver (like MPI).</p>\n<p>JobSet aims to address those gaps using the Job API as a building block to build a richer API for\nlarge-scale distributed HPC and ML use cases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-jobset-works\">How JobSet Works</h2>\n<p>JobSet models a distributed batch workload as a group of Kubernetes Jobs. This allows a user to\neasily specify different pod templates for different distinct groups of pods (e.g. a leader,\nworkers, parameter servers, etc.).</p>\n<p>It uses the abstraction of a ReplicatedJob to manage child Jobs, where a ReplicatedJob is\nessentially a Job Template with some desired number of Job replicas specified. This provides a\ndeclarative way to easily create identical child-jobs to run on different islands of accelerators,\nwithout resorting to scripting or Helm charts to generate many versions of the same job but with\ndifferent names.</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-large clickable-zoom\">\n<img alt=\"JobSet Architecture\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/23/introducing-jobset/jobset_diagram.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Some other key JobSet features which address the problems described above include:</p>\n<p>Replicated Jobs : In modern data centers, hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs allocated in\nislands of homogenous accelerators connected via a specialized, high bandwidth network links. For\nexample, a user might provision nodes containing a group of hosts co-located on a rack, each with\nH100 GPUs, where GPU chips within each host are connected via NVLink, with a NVLink Switch\nconnecting the multiple NVLinks. TPU Pods are another example of this: TPU ViperLitePods consist of\n64 hosts, each with 4 TPU v5e chips attached, all connected via ICI mesh. When running a distributed\ntraining job across multiple of these islands, we often want to partition the workload into a group\nof smaller identical jobs, 1 per island, where each pod primarily communicates with the pods within\nthe same island to do segments of distributed computation, and keeping the gradient synchronization\nover DCN (data center network, which is lower bandwidth than ICI) to a bare minimum.</p>\n<p>Automatic headless service creation, configuration, and lifecycle management : Pod-to-pod\ncommunication via pod hostname is enabled by default, with automatic configuration and lifecycle\nmanagement of the headless service enabling this.</p>\n<p>Configurable success policies : JobSet has configurable success policies which target specific\nReplicatedJobs, with operators to target “Any” or “All” of their child jobs. For example, you can\nconfigure the JobSet to be marked complete if and only if all pods that are part of the “worker”\nReplicatedJob are completed.</p>\n<p>Configurable failure policies : JobSet has configurable failure policies which allow the user to\nspecify a maximum number of times the JobSet should be restarted in the event of a failure. If any\njob is marked failed, the entire JobSet will be recreated, allowing the workload to resume from the\nlast checkpoint. When no failure policy is specified, if any job fails, the JobSet simply fails.</p>\n<p>Exclusive placement per topology domain : JobSet allows users to express that child jobs have 1:1\nexclusive assignment to a topology domain, typically an accelerator island like a rack. For example,\nif the JobSet creates two child jobs, then this feature will enforce that the pods of each child job\nwill be co-located on the same island, and that only one child job is allowed to schedule per\nisland. This is useful for scenarios where we want to use a distributed data parallel (DDP) training\nstrategy to train a model using multiple islands of compute resources (GPU racks or TPU slices),\nrunning 1 model replica in each accelerator island, ensuring the forward and backward passes\nthemselves occur within a single model replica occurs over the high bandwidth interconnect linking\nthe accelerators chips within the island, and only the gradient synchronization between model\nreplicas occurs across accelerator islands over the lower bandwidth data center network.</p>\n<p>Integration with Kueue : Users can submit JobSets via <a href=\"https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/\">Kueue</a> to\noversubscribe their clusters, queue workloads to run as capacity becomes available, prevent partial\nscheduling and deadlocks, enable multi-tenancy, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-use-case\">Example use case</h2>\n<h3 id=\"distributed-ml-training-on-multiple-tpu-slices-with-jax\">Distributed ML training on multiple TPU slices with Jax</h3>\n<p>The following example is a JobSet spec for running a TPU Multislice workload on 4 TPU v5e\n<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm#slices\">slices</a>. To learn more about\nTPU concepts and terminology, please refer to these\n<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm\">docs</a>.</p>\n<p>This example uses <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html\">Jax</a>, an ML framework with\nnative support for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation targeting TPU chips via\n<a href=\"https://github.com/openxla\">OpenXLA</a>. However, you can also use\n<a href=\"https://pytorch.org/xla/release/2.3/index.html\">PyTorch/XLA</a> to do ML training on TPUs.</p>\n<p>This example makes use of several JobSet features (both explicitly and implicitly) to support the\nunique scheduling requirements of TPU multislice training out-of-the-box with very little\nconfiguration required by the user.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080;

I’ve been contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various\nareas, including controllers, apiserver, and kubectl.</p>\n<p><strong>Janet</strong>: Certainly! I'm Janet, a Staff Software Engineer at Google, and I've been deeply involved\nwith the Kubernetes project since its early days, even before the 1.0 launch in 2015. It's been an\namazing journey!</p>\n<p>My current role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. My\njourney with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the Deployment API and adding\nrolling update functionalities. I naturally gravitated towards SIG Apps and became increasingly\ninvolved. Over time, I took on more responsibilities, culminating in my current leadership roles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-apps\">About SIG Apps</h2>\n<p><em>All following answers were jointly provided by Maciej and Janet.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: For those unfamiliar, could you provide an overview of SIG Apps' mission and objectives?\nWhat key problems does it aim to solve within the Kubernetes ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>As described in our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-apps/charter.md#scope\">charter</a>, we cover a\nbroad area related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes. That, in\nshort, means we’re open to each and everyone showing up at our bi-weekly meetings and discussing the\nups and downs of writing and deploying various applications on Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of the most significant projects or initiatives currently being undertaken\nby SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>At this point in time, the main factors driving the development of our controllers are the\nchallenges coming from running various AI-related workloads. It’s worth giving credit here to two\nworking groups we’ve sponsored over the past years:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-batch\">The Batch Working Group</a>, which is\nlooking at running HPC, AI/ML, and data analytics jobs on top of Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-serving\">The Serving Working Group</a>, which\nis focusing on hardware-accelerated AI/ML inference.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"best-practices-and-challenges\">Best practices and challenges</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: SIG Apps plays a crucial role in developing application management best practices for\nKubernetes. Can you share some of these best practices and how they help improve application\nlifecycle management?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Implementing <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">health checks and readiness probes</a>\nensures that your applications are healthy and ready to serve traffic, leading to improved\nreliability and uptime. The above, combined with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing\nsolutions, will provide insights into your application's behavior, enabling you to identify and\nresolve issues quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/\">Auto-scale your application</a> based\non resource utilization or custom metrics, optimizing resource usage and ensuring your\napplication can handle varying loads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use Deployment for stateless applications, StatefulSet for stateful applications, Job\nand CronJob for batch workloads, and DaemonSet for running a daemon on each node. Use\nOperators and CRDs to extend the Kubernetes API to automate the deployment, management, and\nlifecycle of complex applications, making them easier to operate and reducing manual\nintervention.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of the common challenges SIG Apps faces, and how do you address them?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest challenge we’re facing all the time is the need to reject a lot of features, ideas, and\nimprovements. This requires a lot of discipline and patience to be able to explain the reasons\nbehind those decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: How has the evolution of Kubernetes influenced the work of SIG Apps? Are there any\nrecent changes or upcoming features in Kubernetes that you find particularly relevant or beneficial\nfor SIG Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>The main benefit for both us and the whole community around SIG Apps is the ability to extend\nkubernetes with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">Custom Resource Definitions</a>\nand the fact that users can build their own custom controllers leveraging the built-in ones to\nachieve whatever sophisticated use cases they might have and we, as the core maintainers, haven’t\nconsidered or weren’t able to efficiently resolve inside Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contributing-to-sig-apps\">Contributing to SIG Apps</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What opportunities are available for new contributors who want to get involved with SIG\nApps, and what advice would you give them?</strong></p>\n<p>We get the question, &quot;What good first issue might you recommend we start with?&quot; a lot :-) But\nunfortunately, there’s no easy answer to it. We always tell everyone that the best option to start\ncontributing to core controllers is to find one you are willing to spend some time with. Read\nthrough the code, then try running unit tests and integration tests focusing on that\ncontroller. Once you grasp the general idea, try breaking it and the tests again to verify your\nbreakage. Once you start feeling confident you understand that particular controller, you may want\nto search through open issues affecting that controller and either provide suggestions, explaining\nthe problem users have, or maybe attempt your first fix.</p>\n<p>Like we said, there are no shortcuts on that road; you need to spend the time with the codebase to\nunderstand all the edge cases we’ve slowly built up to get to the point where we are. Once you’re\nsuccessful with one controller, you’ll need to repeat that same process with others all over again.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: How does SIG Apps gather feedback from the community, and how is this feedback\nintegrated into your work?</strong></p>\n<p>We always encourage everyone to show up and present their problems and solutions during our\nbi-weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#meetings\">meetings</a>. As long\nas you’re solving an interesting problem on top of Kubernetes and you can provide valuable feedback\nabout any of the core controllers, we’re always happy to hear from everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: Looking ahead, what are the key focus areas or upcoming trends in application management\nwithin Kubernetes that SIG Apps is excited about? How is the SIG adapting to these trends?</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely the current AI hype is the major driving factor; as mentioned above, we have two working\ngroups, each covering a different aspect of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan: What are some of your favorite things about this SIG?</strong></p>\n<p>Without a doubt, the people that participate in our meetings and on\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-apps\">Slack</a>, who tirelessly help triage issues, pull\nrequests and invest a lot of their time (very frequently their private time) into making kubernetes\ngreat!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>SIG Apps is an essential part of the Kubernetes community, helping to shape how applications are\ndeployed and managed at scale. From its work on improving Kubernetes' workload APIs to driving\ninnovation in AI/ML application management, SIG Apps is continually adapting to meet the needs of\nmodern application developers and operators. Whether you’re a new contributor or an experienced\ndeveloper, there’s always an opportunity to get involved and make an impact.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more or contributing to SIG Apps, be sure to check out their <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps\">SIG\nREADME</a> and join their bi-weekly <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps#meetings\">meetings</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/sig-apps\">SIG Apps Mailing List</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-apps\">SIG Apps on Slack</a></li>\n</ul>",

Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a\nbit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin:</strong> Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I\nwork for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes &amp; etcd &amp; CSI\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md\">Container Storage Interface</a>)\nbecause of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes &amp; etcd\n(and also CSI) since 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>James:</strong> Hey team, I’m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a\nSpecialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the\nKubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project\nneeded help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that\n&quot;you come for the technology, and stay for the people&quot;: for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a\nwonderful journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Marek:</strong> Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring\na stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation\">SIG\nInstrumentation</a>, where I\ncreated and led the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/04/kubernetes-1-19-introducing-structured-logs/\">Kubernetes Structured Logging effort</a>.<br />\nI'm still the main project lead for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/\">Kubernetes Metrics Server</a>,\nproviding crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,\nright around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most\nscalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's\nhistory. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia:</strong> Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd\nmaintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)\nand GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and\netcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my\njob, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more\nimportantly, the awesome open source community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming-a-kubernetes-special-interest-group-sig\">Becoming a Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG)</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is\na very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,\nserving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and\nreliability issues. <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2023/introducing-sig-etcd/\">Creating a dedicated SIG</a>\nallowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,\nand ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just\ndescribed being addressed, and to what extent?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and\ntransparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals</a>\nand PRRs (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">Production Readiness Reviews</a>,\nwhich has improved our feature development and release cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from\nbecoming a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like\n<a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a> and <a href=\"https://testgrid.k8s.io/\">TestGrid</a>. For large projects like\netcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear\ntools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also\nhelp etcd.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation\nfor addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes\necosystem.</p>\n<p>The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I’d like\nto highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd\ncontributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had\ngreater collaboration with other SIGs like <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md\">SIG API\nMachinery</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Scalability</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability\">SIG Testing</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle\">SIG Cluster Lifecycle</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes\necosystem. The formation of the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-etcd-operator/README.md\">etcd Operator Working Group</a>\nunder the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful\ncollaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within\nKubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and\ncommunity involvement in recent months?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>James</strong>: Yes -- as showing in our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/23/prs-authors-repository-groups?orgId=1&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000\">unique PR author data</a>\nwe recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Unique PR author data stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Additionally, looking at our\n<a href=\"https://etcd.devstats.cncf.io/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&amp;from=1422748800000&amp;to=1738454399000&amp;var-period=m&amp;var-metric=contributions&amp;var-repogroup_name=All&amp;var-country_name=All&amp;var-company_name=All&amp;var-company=all\">overall contributions across all etcd project repositories</a>\nwe are also observing a positive trend showing a resurgence in etcd project activity:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overall contributions stats\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/04/sig-etcd-spotlight/stats2.png\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The road ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current\npriorities for SIG etcd?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Reliability is always top of mind -– we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also\nworking on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making\netcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of\ncourse, scaling -– we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure\nnot only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve\nthe understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points\nthat the community cares about the most.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: SIG API Machinery, for sure – they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're\nconstantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle – etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,\nso we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG\nScalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the\nevolving cloud native landscape?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The\ncloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how\ncan they get involved?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md#meetings\">SIG etcd meetings</a>,\nfollow discussions on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev\">etcd-dev mailing list</a>, and check\nout our <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues\">GitHub issues</a>. We're always looking for people to\nreview proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: I love this question 😀 . There are numerous ways for people interested in contributing\nto SIG etcd to get involved and make a difference. Here are some key areas where you can help:</p>\n<p><strong>Code Contributions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Bug Fixes</em>: Tackle existing issues in the etcd codebase. Start with issues labeled &quot;good first\nissue&quot; or &quot;help wanted&quot; to find tasks that are suitable for newcomers.</li>\n<li><em>Feature Development</em>: Contribute to the development of new features and enhancements. Check the\netcd roadmap and discussions to see what's being planned and where your skills might fit in.</li>\n<li><em>Testing and Code Reviews</em>: Help ensure the quality of etcd by writing tests, reviewing code\nchanges, and providing feedback.</li>\n<li><em>Documentation</em>: Improve <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/\">etcd's documentation</a> by adding new content,\nclarifying existing information, or fixing errors. Clear and comprehensive documentation is\nessential for users and contributors.</li>\n<li><em>Community Support</em>: Answer questions on forums, mailing lists, or <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C3HD8ARJ5\">Slack channels</a>.\nHelping others understand and use etcd is a valuable contribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Getting Started</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Join the community</em>: Start by joining the etcd community on Slack,\nattending SIG meetings, and following the mailing lists. This will\nhelp you get familiar with the project, its processes, and the\npeople involved.</li>\n<li><em>Find a mentor</em>: If you're new to open source or etcd, consider\nfinding a mentor who can guide you and provide support. Stay tuned!\nOur first cohort of mentorship program was very successful. We will\nhave a new round of mentorship program coming up.</li>\n<li><em>Start small</em>: Don't be afraid to start with small contributions. Even\nfixing a typo in the documentation or submitting a simple bug fix\ncan be a great way to get involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By contributing to etcd, you'll not only be helping to improve a\ncritical piece of the cloud-native ecosystem but also gaining valuable\nexperience and skills. So, jump in and start contributing!</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico: Excellent, thank you. Lastly, one piece of advice that\nyou'd like to give to other newly formed SIGs?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Marek</strong>: Absolutely! My advice would be to embrace the established\nprocesses of the larger community, prioritize collaboration with other\nSIGs, and focus on building a strong community.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenjia</strong>: Here are some tips I myself found very helpful in my OSS\njourney:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Be patient</em>: Open source development can take time. Don't get\ndiscouraged if your contributions aren't accepted immediately or if\nyou encounter challenges.</li>\n<li><em>Be respectful</em>: The etcd community values collaboration and\nrespect. Be mindful of others' opinions and work together to achieve\ncommon goals.</li>\n<li><em>Have fun</em>: Contributing to open source should be\nenjoyable. Find areas that interest you and contribute in ways that\nyou find fulfilling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Frederico: A great way to end this spotlight, thank you all!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>For more information and resources, please take a look at :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>etcd website: <a href=\"https://etcd.io/\">https://etcd.io/</a></li>\n<li>etcd GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd\">https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd</a></li>\n<li>etcd community: <a href=\"https://etcd.io/community/\">https://etcd.io/community/</a></li>\n</ol>",

      "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000",
      "summary": "<p>A new nftables mode for kube-proxy was introduced as an alpha feature\nin Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of\n1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the\niptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent\nkernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even\nonce nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the <em>default</em>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-1-data-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latency</h2>\n<p>The iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and\nhas problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large\nKubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.</p>\n<p>In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a\nnumber of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of\nServices and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top\nlevel of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service\nIP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code># If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain\n# KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O\n# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT\n# etc...\n-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment \"namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP\" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK\n</code></pre><p>This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel\nto check it against all of the Service rules is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number\nof Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and\nthe worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection\nincreases (with the difference between best-case, average, and\nworst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP\naddress appears earlier or later in the <code>KUBE-SERVICES</code> chain).</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like\nthis is to have a <em>single</em> rule, using a &quot;verdict map&quot; to do the\ndispatch:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>table ip kube-proxy {\n# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.\nmap service-ips {\ntype ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict\ncomment \"ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic\"\nelements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,\n172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,\n172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,\n... }\n}\n# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an\n# element in the map. (This rule says, \"construct a tuple from the\n# destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look\n# that tuple up in \"service-ips\"; and if there's a match, execute the\n# associated verdict.)\nchain services {\nip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips\n}\n...\n}\n</code></pre><p>Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly <strong>O(1)</strong> map lookup,\npacket processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster\nsize, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/nftables-only.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the\niptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000\nServices, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as\nthe p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000\nService cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for\nnftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few\nmicroseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to\nsquint to see the nftables results!:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy iptables-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/iptables-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"why-nftables-part-2-control-plane-latency\">Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latency</h2>\n<p>While the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are\ngreat, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often\nkeeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:\nthe time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when\nServices and their endpoints change.</p>\n<p>With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a\nwhole (actual rules, plus associated data) is <strong>O(n)</strong> in the combined\nnumber of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables\nbackend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of\nthousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of\niptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving\nkube-proxy so that it could skip updating <em>most</em> of the unchanged\nrules in each update, but the limitations of <code>iptables-restore</code> as an\nAPI meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's\n<strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller\nconstant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can\nstill be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's <code>minSyncPeriod</code> config\noption to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to\npush iptables updates.</p>\n<p>The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and\nwhen kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the\nupdate is only <strong>O(n)</strong> in the number of Services and endpoints that\nhave changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of\nServices and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each\nnftables-using component to have its own private table also means that\nthere is no global lock contention between components like with\niptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much\nmore efficiently than with iptables.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-nftables\">Why <em>not</em> nftables?</h2>\n<p>All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump\nright into using the nftables backend for now.</p>\n<p>First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit\ntests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in\nthe real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as\nmuch real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise\nthat it is as stable and bug-free.</p>\n<p>Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;\ncurrently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of\nbugs in early versions of the <code>nft</code> command line tool, you should not\nrun kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier\nthan 1.0.0) version of <code>nft</code> in the host filesystem (or else\nkube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables\non the system).</p>\n<p>Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such\nas the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet\nsupport kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the\ndocumentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components\nto see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they\nwill not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or\noverride kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether\nkube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability\nand monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data\nfor kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in\niptables mode.</p>\n<p>Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%\ncompatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old\nkube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less\nperformant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that\nchanging the default would be a compatibility break. Since the\nnftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad\ndefaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In\nparticular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only\nreachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable\non all IPs, including <code>127.0.0.1</code>, with iptables mode.) The\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#migrating-from-iptables-mode-to-nftables\">kube-proxy documentation</a> has more information about this, including\ninformation about metrics you can look at to determine if you are\nrelying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration\noptions are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-out-nftables-mode\">Trying out nftables mode</h2>\n<p>Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to\npass <code>--proxy-mode nftables</code> to kube-proxy (or set <code>mode: nftables</code> in\nyour kube-proxy config file).</p>\n<p>If you are using kubeadm to set up your cluster, the kubeadm\ndocumentation explains <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/#customizing-kube-proxy\">how to pass a <code>KubeProxyConfiguration</code> to\n<code>kubeadm init</code></a>. You can also <a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/#kube-proxy-mode\">deploy nftables-based clusters with\n<code>kind</code></a>.</p>\n<p>You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to\nnftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the\nkube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting\nin nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs\nrules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs\nmode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-plans\">Future plans</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, while nftables is now the <em>best</em> kube-proxy mode,\nit is not the <em>default</em>, and we do not yet have a plan for changing\nthat. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.</p>\n<p>The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main\nadvantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of\nthe IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes\n(for example, the fact that the <code>kube-ipvs0</code> device needs to have\n<em>every</em> Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of\nKubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement\nusing IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have\ndifferent endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a\nlocal or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same\nperformance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of\nthe downsides:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"kube-proxy ipvs-vs-nftables first packet latency, at various percentiles, in clusters of various sizes\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/28/nftables-kube-proxy/ipvs-vs-nftables.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use\nvarious other IPVS functionality, like alternative &quot;schedulers&quot; for\nbalancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,\nbecause kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS\nschedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the\nproxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic\nmore cleverly.)</p>\n<p>While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop\nthe IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people\nwho are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode\ninstead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in\nnftables mode that you can't work around).</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/3866-nftables-proxy/README.md\">KEP-3866: Add an nftables-based kube-proxy backend</a>&quot; has the\nhistory of the new feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yOGHb2HjslY?si=6O4PVJu7fGpReo1U\">How the Tables Have Turned: Kubernetes Says Goodbye to IPTables</a>&quot;,\nfrom KubeCon/CloudNativeCon North America 2024, talks about porting\nkube-proxy and Calico from iptables to nftables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/uYo2O3jbJLk?si=py2AXzMJZ4PuhxNg\">From Observability to Performance</a>&quot;, from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon\nNorth America 2024.

The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information,\nlike the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the\nNode, Region and Instance type information.</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-medium \">\n<img alt=\"Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/02/14/cloud-controller-manager-chicken-egg-problem/ccm-chicken-egg-problem-sequence-diagram.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Chicken and egg problem sequence diagram</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet\nwas able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved\nto the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#chicken-and-egg\">chicken and egg problem</a>\nduring the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the\ncontroller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,\nstandalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using\n<code>hostNetwork</code> (more on this below)</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-the-dependency-problem\">Examples of the dependency problem</h2>\n<p>As noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be\nunschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few\nconcrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might\noccur.</p>\n<p>These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource\n(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods\nrely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it\nwill schedule properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-uninitialized-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taint</h3>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/#running-cloud-controller-manager\">noted in the Kubernetes documentation</a>, when the kubelet is started with the command line\nflag <code>--cloud-provider=external</code>, its corresponding <code>Node</code> object will have a no schedule taint\nnamed <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> added. Because the cloud-controller-manager\nis responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a\ncloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a <code>Deployment</code>\nor <code>DaemonSet</code>, may not be able to schedule.</p>\n<p>If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the\ncontrol plane, then the resulting <code>Node</code> objects will all have the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> no schedule taint. It also means that this taint\nwill not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no\nschedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface\ncontrollers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-cloud-controller-manager-not-scheduling-due-to-not-ready-taint\">Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taint</h3>\n<p>The next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is\nwaiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not\ntolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#node-kubernetes-io-not-ready\">Kubernetes documentation describes</a> the <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container\nnetwork has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible\nfor adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container\nnetwork controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some\ncircumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.</p>\n<p>This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the\ncloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is\nnot able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container\nnetwork controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the\n<code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> and <code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taints,\nleaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-recommendations\">Our Recommendations</h2>\n<p>There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the\nspecific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the\nlifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:</p>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager\nwill need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.\nSetting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host\nnetworking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as\nthe host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This\nwill ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check\nyour networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).</li>\n<li>Use a scalable resource type. <code>Deployments</code> and <code>DaemonSets</code> are useful for controlling the\nlifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy\nas well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using\nthese primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple\nreplicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide\nwith each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.</li>\n<li>Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other\ncontrollers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager\ncontroller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.\nUse a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the\ncontrol plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital\nto adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the\nphysical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run\nwith a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation\nfrom non-privileged user workloads.\n<ol>\n<li>It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running\non the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade\nthe cloud controller performance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud\ncontroller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run\nin situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate\nthe <code>node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized</code> taint, and it should also tolerate any\ntaints associated with the control plane (for example, <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane</code>\nor <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/master</code>). It can also be useful to tolerate the\n<code>node.kubernetes.io/not-ready</code> taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the\nnode is not yet available for health monitoring.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,\nin a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the\ndependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice\nfor running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network\nconstraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology\nfor these scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n<p>This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is\nimportant to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please\nconsult your cloud provider’s documentation.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nname: cloud-controller-manager\nnamespace: kube-system\nspec:\nreplicas: 2\nselector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nstrategy:\ntype: Recreate\ntemplate:\nmetadata:\nlabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\nannotations:\nkubernetes.io/description: Cloud controller manager for my infrastructure\nspec:\ncontainers: # the container details will depend on your specific cloud controller manager\n- name: cloud-controller-manager\ncommand:\n- /bin/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager\n- --leader-elect=true\n- -v=1\nimage: registry/my-infrastructure-cloud-controller-manager@latest\nresources:\nrequests:\ncpu: 200m\nmemory: 50Mi\nhostNetwork: true # these Pods are part of the control plane\nnodeSelector:\nnode-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: \"\"\naffinity:\npodAntiAffinity:\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n- topologyKey: \"kubernetes.io/hostname\"\nlabelSelector:\nmatchLabels:\napp.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-controller-manager\ntolerations:\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node-role.kubernetes.io/master\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoExecute\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\ntolerationSeconds: 120\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized\noperator: Exists\n- effect: NoSchedule\nkey: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready\noperator: Exists\n</code></pre><p>When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that\ncluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple\nreplicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and\nredundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance\nof a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.</p>",

Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kirsten Garrison (KG)</strong>: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and\ncurrently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with\nthe help of <a href=\"https://github.com/carolynvs\">Carolyn Van Slyck</a>. With time, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.17/release_team.md\">I joined the Release\nteam</a>,\neventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I\nworked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in\nprocess) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and\ncontributing to the Subproject’s work.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of\nintervention?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/README.md#enhancements\">Enhancements\nSubproject</a>\nprimarily concerns itself with the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/0000-kep-process/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement\nProposal</a>\n(<em>KEP</em> for short)—the &quot;design&quot; documents required for all features and significant changes\nto the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kep-and-its-impact\">The KEP and its impact</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily\ninvolved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/#the-release-cycle\">Every release</a>, the SIGs let the\nRelease Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned\nabove, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors\nmust fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages\">will move\nthrough 3\nphases</a>:\nalpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.</p>\n<p>The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md\">KEP\ntemplate</a>\nhas different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed\ndiscussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and\nperformance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review\nteam and the Production Readiness Review team<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#fn:1\">1</a></sup> before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is\nlooking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and\nperformant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and\nmerge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most\nsignificant improvements of that approach?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on\nthe core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way\nto discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP\nprocess is communication and consideration.</p>\n<p>To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP\ntemplate. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancements</a> repo into its current form -- a\ndirectory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with\nProposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted\ntoday, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process\nin place over time.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single\nfeature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user\nexpectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The\naddition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements\n(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-areas-of-focus\">Current areas of focus</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: Speaking of maturing, we’ve <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/13/kubernetes-v1-31-release/\">recently released Kubernetes\nv1.31</a>, and work on v1.32 <a href=\"https://github.com/fsmunoz/sig-release/tree/release-1.32/releases/release-1.32\">has\nstarted</a>. Are there\nany areas that the Enhancements sub-project is currently addressing that might change the way things\nare done?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: We’re currently working on two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Creating a Process KEP template.</em> Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for\nsignificant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to\nsupport this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so\nwill only encourage more discussion and transparency.</li>\n<li><em>KEP versioning.</em> While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we\nbelieve that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with\na versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we\nbelieve that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were\nintroduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was\nthis a particular area of focus for the subproject?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away\nfrom using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has\nalways been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition\nto an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads &quot;opt-in&quot; KEPs for release tracking. This\nhelped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken\non a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid\nintroducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the\nSubproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection\nprocess. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native\nlabels on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\">k/enhancement</a> issues and project boards.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the\nEnhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to\ndecisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to\ngive an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the\nRelease Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a\ngreat success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in\nthe KEP process!</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the\nrequired skills for participating in the sub-project?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the\nkubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take\nit from there.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to\nshare with our readers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>KG</strong>: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires\nenormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it\nsuccessful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the\nproject great. This is truly a wonderful community.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>For more information, check the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/11/02/sig-architecture-production-readiness-spotlight-2023/\">Production Readiness Review spotlight\ninterview</a>\nin this series.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#fnref:1\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

      "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000",
      "summary": "<p>Volume group snapshots were <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/08/kubernetes-1-27-volume-group-snapshot-alpha/\">introduced</a>\nas an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release.\nThe recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to <strong>beta</strong>.\nThe support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/group-snapshot-restore-feature.html#volume-group-snapshot-apis\">extension APIs for group snapshots</a>.\nThese APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes.\nBehind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims\nfor snapshotting.\nA key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and\nrecover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.</p>\n<p>This new feature is only supported for <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/\">CSI</a> volume drivers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-overview-of-volume-group-snapshots\">An overview of volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of\nmultiple volumes. A group snapshot represents <em>copies</em> made from multiple volumes, that\nare taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate\nnew volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to\na previous state (represented by the snapshots).</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-add-volume-group-snapshots-to-kubernetes\">Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes?</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that\nautomates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block\nand file storage.</p>\n<p>Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability:\nKubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and\nunderlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the\ncluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</p>\n<p>There was already a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/\">VolumeSnapshot</a> API\nthat provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against\ndata loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities\nnot covered by the VolumeSnapshot API.</p>\n<p>Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be\ntaken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency.\nThis can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example,\nan application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume.\nIf snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times,\nthe application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored\nfrom those snapshots when a disaster strikes.</p>\n<p>It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from\neach volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the\napplication after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get\napplication consistent snapshots.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes the application quiesce can be so time consuming that you want to do it less frequently,\nor it may not be possible to quiesce an application at all.\nFor example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce\nand nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which\nprovides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-apis-for-volume-group-snapshots\">Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes' support for <em>volume group snapshots</em> relies on three API kinds that\nare used\nfor managing snapshots:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshot</dt>\n<dd>Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request\ncreation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the\ntimestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use.\nThe creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a\ncluster resource (a group snapshot).</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</dt>\n<dd>Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot.\nIt contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group\nsnapshot ID.\nThis object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot).\nThe VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it\nwas created with a one-to-one mapping.</dd>\n<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotClass</dt>\n<dd>Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be\ncreated, including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These three API kinds are defined as\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">CustomResourceDefinitions</a>\n(CRDs).\nThese CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support\nvolume group snapshots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-components-are-needed-to-support-volume-group-snapshots\">What components are needed to support volume group snapshots</h2>\n<p>Volume group snapshots are implemented in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter\">external-snapshotter</a> repository.\nImplementing volume group snapshots meant adding or changing several components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs.</li>\n<li>Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller.</li>\n<li>Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The volume snapshot controller and CRDs are deployed once per\ncluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as a cluster addon.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends that Kubernetes distributors\nbundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part\nof their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-beta\">What's new in Beta?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The VolumeGroupSnapshot feature in CSI spec moved to GA in the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/releases/tag/v1.11.0\">v1.11.0 release</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The snapshot validation webhook was deprecated in external-snapshotter v8.0.0 and it is now removed.\nMost of the validation webhook logic was added as validation rules into the CRDs.\nMinimum required Kubernetes version is 1.25 for these validation rules.\nOne thing in the validation webhook not moved to CRDs is the prevention of creating\nmultiple default volume snapshot classes and multiple default volume group snapshot classes\nfor the same CSI driver.\nWith the removal of the validation webhook, an error will still be raised when dynamically\nprovisioning a VolumeSnapshot or VolumeGroupSnapshot when multiple default volume snapshot\nclasses or multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver exist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>enable-volumegroup-snapshot</code> flag in the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter\nsidecar has been replaced by a feature gate.\nSince VolumeGroupSnapshot is a new API, the feature moves to Beta but the feature gate is\ndisabled by default.\nTo use this feature, enable the feature gate by adding the flag <code>--feature-gates=CSIVolumeGroupSnapshot=true</code>\nwhen starting the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The logic to dynamically create the VolumeGroupSnapshot and its corresponding individual\nVolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects are moved from the CSI snapshotter to the common\nsnapshot-controller.\nNew RBAC rules are added to the common snapshot-controller and some RBAC rules are removed from\nthe CSI snapshotter sidecar accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots\">How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots</h2>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-new-group-snapshot-with-kubernetes\">Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to\nsnapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot\nobject.</p>\n<p>The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot\nshould be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent\nshould be used.</p>\n<p>A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a cluster administrator.\nIt contains the details of the real volume group snapshot on the storage system which\nis available for use by cluster users.</p>\n<p>One of the following members in the source of the group snapshot must be set.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>selector</code> - a label query over PersistentVolumeClaims that are to be grouped\ntogether for snapshotting. This selector will be used to match the label\nadded to a PVC.</li>\n<li><code>volumeGroupSnapshotContentName</code> - specifies the name of a pre-existing\nVolumeGroupSnapshotContent object representing an existing volume group snapshot.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"dynamically-provision-a-group-snapshot\">Dynamically provision a group snapshot</h4>\n<p>In the following example, there are two PVCs.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS VOLUMEATTRIBUTESCLASS AGE\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">pvc-0 Bound pvc-6e1f7d34-a5c5-4548-b104-01e72c72b9f2 100Mi RWO csi-hostpath-sc &lt;unset&gt;

      "summary": "<p>Security can no longer be an afterthought in the development process. Organizations need robust solutions that integrate security throughout the entire software development lifecycle. This is where the partnership between HackerOne and GitLab creates a compelling combination for modern application development teams.</p>\n<p>GitLab, the comprehensive, AI-powered DevSecOps platform, and HackerOne, the leading crowd-sourced security platform, have established a partnership that brings together the best of both worlds: GitLab's streamlined DevSecOps workflow and HackerOne's powerful vulnerability management capabilities.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to enhance developer productivity and your security posture by implementing HackerOne's GitLab integration.</p>\n<h2>An integration that empowers developers</h2>\n<p>HackerOne's GitLab integration is remarkably straightforward, yet powerful. When security researchers discover vulnerabilities through HackerOne's platform, these findings are automatically converted into GitLab issues. This creates a seamless workflow where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security researchers identify vulnerabilities via HackerOne's platform</li>\n<li>Validated vulnerabilities are automatically converted into GitLab issues</li>\n<li>Development teams can address these issues directly within their existing workflow</li>\n<li>Resolution status is synchronized between both platforms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can start leveraging the benefits of GitLab and HackerOne by using the <a href=\"https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/8571227-gitlab-integration\">integration</a> to track GitLab issues as references on HackerOne. This integration provides bi-directional and seamless data syncing between your HackerOne report and GitLab issues, improving alignment between development and security teams while streamlining security vulnerability processing.</p>\n<p>To configure the GitLab integration to sync information between your HackerOne report and your Gitlab issue, follow the instructions provided in <a href=\"https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/10394699-gitlab-setup\">HackerOne's GitLab integration documentation</a>, which includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html\">Setting up an OAuth 2.0 application</a> for your GitLab instance with the provided HackerOne settings</li>\n<li>Connecting HackerOne to the newly created OAuth 2.0 on GitLab</li>\n<li>Authorizing HackerOne to access the GitLab API</li>\n<li>Configuring which GitLab project you would like to escalate HackerOne reports to</li>\n<li>Selecting the HackerOne fields to map to corresponding GitLab fields</li>\n<li>GitLab-to-HackerOne and HackerOne-to-GitLab event configuration</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the integration is in place, you’ll be able to seamlessly sync data bi-directionally between both GitLab and HackerOne. This helps simplify context-switching and allows vulnerabilities to be tracked with ease throughout both systems. The integration allows for the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creating a GitLab Issue from HackerOne:</strong> You can create new GitLab issues for reports you receive on HackerOne.</li>\n<li><strong>Linking HackerOne reports to existing GitLab tasks.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Syncing updates from HackerOne to GitLab:</strong> The following updates on a report are synced as a comment to GitLab.\n<ul>\n<li>Report comments</li>\n<li>State changes</li>\n<li>Rewards</li>\n<li>Assignee changes</li>\n<li>Public disclosure</li>\n<li>Close GitLab Issue</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Syncing Updates from GitLab to HackerOne:</strong> The following updates on GitLab will be reflected in HackerOne as an internal comment on the associated report:\n<ul>\n<li>Comments</li>\n<li>State changes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>HackerOne severity to GitLab label mapping</strong>: Allows you to set a custom priority when escalating a report to GitLab.</li>\n<li><strong>Due date mapping:</strong> Allows you to automatically set a custom due date based on the severity of a report.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab + HackerOne adding comments or change the state of the report in GitLab\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/2N5l1FSxZzvuIq0kk1P4KN/9ac52d5675aa04cc26e8da9eef63890d/sync.png\" /></p>\n<p>These features improve alignment between development and security teams and streamlining security vulnerability processing. To learn more on how the integration works, see the <a href=\"https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/8571227-gitlab-integration\">integration documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>A look into HackerOne bug bounty programs</h2>\n<p>HackerOne provides bug bounty programs or cybersecurity initiatives where rewards are offered for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities in customers’ software systems, websites, or applications. Bug bounty programs help enhance the security of an application by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying security flaws before malicious actors can exploit them</li>\n<li>Leveraging diverse expertise from a global community of security researchers</li>\n<li>Providing a cost-effective way to improve cybersecurity</li>\n<li>Complementing internal security efforts and traditional penetration testing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab utilizes HackerOne’s bug bounty program, allowing security researchers to report vulnerabilities in GitLab applications or infrastructure. This crowdsourced approach helps GitLab identify and address potential security issues more effectively.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"HackerOne GitLab Bug Bounty page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4MxMuraWQBq15W0sfIWOAr/36d6f08ed8678df788df7cd2a0475bee/hackerone_gitlab_bug_bounty_page.png\" /></p>\n<p>By leveraging HackerOne's platform and the global hacker community, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture, identify vulnerabilities faster, and stay ahead of potential threats.</p>\n<h2>Secure applications and improve efficiency with the GitLab</h2>\n<p>GitLab provides a complete DevSecOps platform, which enables functionality for the complete software development lifecycle, including security and compliance tools. GitLab supports the following security scanner types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</li>\n<li>Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</li>\n<li>Container Scanning</li>\n<li>Dependency Scanning</li>\n<li>Infrastructure as Code Scanning</li>\n<li>Coverage-guided Fuzzing</li>\n<li>Web API Fuzzing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With GitLab, you can add security scanning by simply applying a template to your CI/CD pipeline definition file. For example, enabling SAST just takes a few lines of code in the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">stage:\n  - test\n\ninclude:\n  - template: Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will run SAST on the test stage, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks\">auto-detect the languages used</a> in your application.

      "summary": "<p>We live in a time where data breaches and phishing attacks make daily headlines. These breaches can cause harm to an organization, such as regulatory fines, business downtime, or even worse, reputational damage. In terms of authentication, passwords have been the backbone of online security for decades, however, they're increasingly proving inadequate against sophisticated cyber threats.</p>\n<p>GitLab and <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/\">Yubico</a> have partnered to strengthen software development security through robust authentication measures. Yubico is the inventor of the YubiKey, a hardware security key that delivers phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA). By implementing FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and YubiKey hardware protection, GitLab offers developers a powerful defense against phishing attacks and other cyber threats, ensuring their code and projects remain secure. This collaboration expands enterprise-grade authentication in the GitLab platform, allowing programmers to focus on creating software while maintaining confidence in their account's integrity.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to configure GitLab to use YubiKeys to protect developers from online threats. You’ll also learn how to further prevent tampering with GitLab verified commits.</p>\n<h2>How YubiKeys work</h2>\n<p>At their core, YubiKeys function as cryptographic hardware tokens that generate and store private keys in a secure element. These keys implement FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication protocols, which can be used as an additional factor to login to GitLab.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works when logging in:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You enter your username and password.</li>\n<li>GitLab sends a cryptographic challenge to your browser.</li>\n<li>Your browser requests the YubiKey to sign this challenge.</li>\n<li>You physically touch the YubiKey to approve.</li>\n<li>The YubiKey creates a unique cryptographic signature for that specific service and challenge.</li>\n<li>GitLab verifies the signature using your public key stored during setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most major security breaches involve compromised passwords. Adding a YubiKey secures your account from a remote breach, even if your password is stolen, so you can rest assured that your GitLab account is secure. Additional key security benefits of using YubiKey for authentication with GitLab include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Phishing protection:</strong> Fake sites won't have the correct cryptographic keys to verify the response.</li>\n<li><strong>No secrets to steal:</strong> The private key never leaves the YubiKey.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical security:</strong> Physical presence is required to use it (you must touch the YubiKey).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up YubiKey multifactor authentication in GitLab</h2>\n<p>Now let’s go over how to set up a Yubikey for multifactor authentication in GitLab. Make sure you're using a <a href=\"https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016615020-Operating-system-and-web-browser-support-for-FIDO2-and-U2F\">supported browser and operating system</a> as they have better WebAuthn support for hardware security keys.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>First, log in to your GitLab account and go to your user settings (click your avatar in the top left corner and select <strong>Preferences</strong>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the left sidebar, click on <strong>Account</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Two-factor Authentication</strong> section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you haven't already enabled 2FA, you'll need to do that first.</p>\n<p>a. Click <strong>Enable two-factor authentication</strong>.</p>\n<p>b. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app.</p>\n<p>c. Enter the code from your authenticator app.</p>\n<p>d. Enter your GitLab password. If you ever need to access your GitLab account without using Google authentication, you may need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <strong>Forgot password</strong> option on the GitLab login page to set up a separate GitLab password.</li>\n<li>Contact your GitLab administrator to help you set up alternative login methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>e. Save your recovery codes in a safe place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once 2FA is enabled, go back to the previous screen by pressing <strong>Manage two-factor authentication</strong> and scroll down to the <strong>Register hardware token</strong> section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Press the <strong>Set up new device</strong> button.<br />\na.

When considering your home, car, or office, you wouldn’t think twice about having a backup key to keep in a safe place. Your digital self should get the same level of consideration. A backup YubiKey kept in a safe place provides a quick and safe backup if your primary YubiKey is lost. Keeping a backup will also easily enable you to deactivate the lost YubiKey and add a new primary or secondary YubiKey.</p>\n<p>If you do not have an additional YubiKey added, it is recommended to have another form of 2FA added to your accounts. In either case, you should be able to get access to your account and remove the lost key from the account. Please note that if a spare key or another authentication method hasn’t been added, you will need to contact the service/website for help with recovering your account.</p>\n<h2>GitLab verified commits</h2>\n<p>To further prevent tampering, you can also configure verified commits. Verified commits in GitLab use GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) signatures to prove that a commit actually came from you. This adds another layer of security on top of authentication by ensuring that not only is your account secure, but every code change can be cryptographically verified as coming from you.</p>\n<p>Your YubiKey can store GPG keys:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The private key is stored securely on the YubiKey.</li>\n<li>The public key is shared with GitLab.</li>\n<li>The key pair is used to sign your commits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the GPG keys have been set up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you make a commit, Git uses your private key to create a signature.</li>\n<li>The GPG key is accessed from the attached YubiKey.</li>\n<li>The signature is stored with the commit metadata.</li>\n<li>GitLab verifies the signature using your public key.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up verified commits</h2>\n<p>Let’s go over how to configure verified commits.

GitLab's Secret Detection feature provides a powerful solution to identify and prevent the exposure of sensitive data. This tutorial explores how GitLab Secret Detection works, how to create custom rulesets for finding personally identifiable information, and how GitLab Duo Chat can streamline the creation of regex patterns for PII detection.</p>\n<h2>Understanding GitLab Secret Detection</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/\">GitLab Secret Detection</a> is a security scanning feature integrated into the GitLab CI/CD pipeline. It automatically scans your codebase to identify hardcoded secrets, credentials, and other sensitive information that shouldn't be stored in your repository.</p>\n<h3>Key benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data breach prevention</strong> detects secrets before they're committed to your repository.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated scanning</strong> runs as part of your CI/CD pipeline without manual intervention.</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable rules</strong> extend detection capabilities with custom patterns.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance support</strong> helps meet regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, and the California Privacy Protection Act.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Create custom rulesets for PII detection</h2>\n<p>While GitLab's default secret detection covers common secrets like API keys and passwords, you may need custom rules to identify specific types of PII relevant to your organization.</p>\n<p>To get started, create a new GitLab project and follow the steps below. You can follow along and see usage examples in our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/tutorials/security-and-governance/devsecops/secret-scanning/pii-data-ruleset\">PII Demo Application</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Set up Secret Detection</strong></p>\n<p>Ensure Secret Detection is enabled in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>include:\n  - template: Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nsecret_detection:\n  variables:\n    SECRET_DETECTION_EXCLUDED_PATHS: &quot;rules,.gitlab,README.md,LICENSE&quot;\n    SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN: &quot;true&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Create a custom ruleset file</strong></p>\n<p>Create the directory and file <code>rules/pii-data-extenson.toml</code>, which contains the regex patterns for PII data along with an allowlist of patterns to ignore. Below are patterns to detect passport numbers (USA), phone numbers (USA), and email addresses:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[extend]\n# Extends default packaged ruleset, NOTE: do not change the path.\npath = &quot;/gitleaks.toml&quot;\n\n# Patterns to ignore (used for tests)\n[allowlist]\ndescription = &quot;allowlist of patterns and paths to ignore in detection&quot;\nregexTarget = &quot;match&quot;\nregexes = ['''555-555-5555''', '''user@example.com''']\npaths = ['''(.*?)(jpg|gif|doc|pdf|bin|svg|socket)''']\n\n# US Passport Number (USA)\n[[rules]]\nid = &quot;us_passport_detection&quot;\ntitle = &quot;US Passport Number&quot;\ndescription = &quot;Detects US passport numbers&quot;\nregex = '''\\b[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9]{6,9}\\b'''\nkeywords = [&quot;passport&quot;]\n\n# Phone Number (USA)\n[[rules]]\nid = &quot;us_phone_number_detection_basic&quot;\ntitle = &quot;US Phone Number&quot;\ndescription = &quot;Detects US phone numbers in basic format&quot;\nregex = '''\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b'''\nkeywords = [&quot;phone&quot;, &quot;mobile&quot;]\n\n# Email Address\n[[rules]]\nid = &quot;email_address&quot;\ntitle = &quot;Email Address&quot;\ndescription = &quot;Detects email addresses&quot;\nregex = '''[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'''\nkeywords = [&quot;email&quot;, &quot;e-mail&quot;]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Extend Secret Detection with the custom ruleset file</strong></p>\n<p>Create a directory and file <code>.gitlab/secret-detection-ruleset.toml</code> in the root of your repository. This file allows you to extend the standard configuration with the PII rules file, and overwrite the severity of the detected vulnerabilities (default severity is <code>Critical</code>).</p>\n<pre><code># Define the pii rules to add to default configuration\n[[secrets.passthrough]]\ntype = &quot;file&quot;\ntarget = &quot;gitleaks.toml&quot;\nvalue = &quot;rules/pii-data-extension.toml&quot;\n\n# Overwrite Phone Number (USA) PII Severity\n[[secrets.ruleset]]\n[secrets.ruleset.identifier]\ntype = &quot;gitleaks_rule_id&quot;\nvalue = &quot;us_phone_number_detection_basic&quot;\n[secrets.ruleset.override]\nseverity = &quot;Medium&quot;\n\n# Overwrite Email Address PII Severity\n[[secrets.ruleset]]\n[secrets.ruleset.identifier]\ntype = &quot;gitleaks_rule_id&quot;\nvalue = &quot;email_address&quot;\n[secrets.ruleset.override]\nseverity = &quot;Low&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Commit your changes</strong></p>\n<p>Now add the changes in the above steps to your project.</p>\n<pre><code>cd /path/to/your/project\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;Add PII data ruleset and Secret Scanning&quot;\ngit push\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the code is committed, Secret Detection will run within the default branch.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Test detection of PII data</strong></p>\n<p>Now that we have configured the Secret Detection scanner, we should perform a test to see if the scanner is detecting the new custom patterns. This can be done by creating a merge request, which adds a new file named <code>customer-data.yaml</code> with the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">customers:  \n  test_user:  \n    phone_number: 555-555-555  \n    email: user@example.com  \n  justin_case:  \n    phone_number: 512-123-4567  \n    passport_number: A12345678  \n    email: justin_case@example.com  \n  chris_p_bacon: \n    phone_number: 305-123-4567  \n    passport_number: B09876543  \n    email: chris_p_bacon@example.com  \n</code></pre>\n<p>The scanner should now perform the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignore the <code>phone_number</code> and <code>email</code> of <code>test_user</code> due to patterns being in allowlist</li>\n<li>Detect six potential vulnerabilities due to the information present for both <code>justin_case</code> and <code>chris_p_bacon</code>\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. passport number severity is set to <code>Critical</code> (default)</li>\n<li>U.S. phone number severity is set to <code>Medium</code> (override)</li>\n<li>Email address severity is set to <code>Low</code> (override)</li>\n<li>Data from rules override is added to each vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/tutorials/security-and-governance/devsecops/secret-scanning/pii-data-ruleset/-/merge_requests/4\">merge request</a> is submitted, the Secret Detection scanner runs and provides the following results:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Secret Detection finding custom PII data MR\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/7bcj3oPzOvkTyxmchpAQfm/92504254915e3f27a3954731416c9798/pii_vulns.png\" /></p>\n<p>When clicking on a vulnerability, you are presented with detailed vulnerability data based on what was configured in your newly set up rules:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Expanded custom PII data vulnerability\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/3em6jCd15NreBVbXBhQadf/e527d4f55b55dea728b538031de9b49a/pii_vulns_expanded.png\" /></p>\n<p>This data allows you to determine the validity of the data present and address it accordingly.</p>\n<p>There are additional ways to configure custom rulesets. For example, rules can be applied remotely to several projects, avoiding the need to duplicate the rules file. See the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/pipeline/configure/\">Secret Detection Configuration documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Common PII types to consider</h2>\n<p>When building your custom ruleset, consider including patterns for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social Security Numbers</li>\n<li>Credit card numbers</li>\n<li>Driver's license numbers</li>\n<li>Passport numbers</li>\n<li>Email addresses</li>\n<li>Phone numbers</li>\n<li>IP addresses</li>\n<li>Physical addresses</li>\n<li>Medical record numbers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Leveraging GitLab Duo Chat for pattern creation</h2>\n<p>Creating effective regex patterns can be challenging.

Chat is available to any user with an assigned GitLab Duo seat.</p>\n<h3>Using GitLab Duo Chat to generate PII regex patterns</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access GitLab Duo Chat:</strong> In the upper right corner, select <strong>GitLab Duo Chat</strong>. A drawer opens on the right side of your screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prompt the chat:</strong> Enter a prompt in the chat input box and press <strong>Enter</strong> or select <strong>Send</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>I need a regex pattern to detect Canadian Zip Codes in our codebase for secret detection\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Review and refine:</strong> GitLab Duo Chat will suggest a regex pattern that you can review and refine:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>Canadian postal codes follow the format &quot;A1A 1A1&quot; (where A is a letter and 1 is a digit). Here's a regex pattern that will detect Canadian postal codes in your codebase, accounting for both spaced and non-spaced formats:\n[A-Za-z]\\d[A-Za-z][ -]?\\d[A-Za-z]\\d\nThis pattern matches:\n* A letter, followed by a digit, followed by a letter\n* An optional space or hyphen\n* A digit, followed by a letter, followed by a digit\nIf you need a more strict pattern that only matches uppercase letters (as official Canadian postal codes use), you can use:\n[A-Z]\\d[A-Z][ -]?\\d[A-Z]\\d\nFor implementation in a secret detection tool, you might want to add word boundaries to avoid partial matches:\n\\b[A-Z]\\d[A-Z][ -]?\\d[A-Z]\\d\\b\nWould you like more details about implementing this in a specific secret detection system?\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test the pattern:</strong> Test the pattern against sample data to ensure it works correctly. You can use sites like <a href=\"https://regex101.com/\">https://regex101.com/</a> to validate patterns before you submit them to your ruleset.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Add to your ruleset:</strong> Once satisfied, add the pattern to your <code>rules/pii-data-extension.toml</code> file and perform some tests to validate. This sample <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/tutorials/security-and-governance/devsecops/secret-scanning/pii-data-ruleset/-/merge_requests/5/diffs\">merge request</a> contains a newly added rule for Canadian Zip Codes based on the above.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, you can use GitLab Duo Chat in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/web_ide/\">The GitLab Web IDE (VS Code in the cloud)</a></li>\n<li>VS Code, with the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow\">GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code</a></li>\n<li>JetBrains IDEs, with the <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22325-gitlab-duo\">GitLab Duo Plugin for JetBrains</a></li>\n<li>Visual Studio for Windows, with the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.GitLabExtensionForVisualStudio\">GitLab Extension for Visual Studio</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the future, you’ll be able to leverage <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_workflow/\">GitLab Duo Workflow</a> (currently in private beta) to automatically generate and add these patterns to your code base directly from your IDE.

Similarly, platform usage data enables us to prioritize the investments and product improvements that drive more impact for you.</p>\n<p>Historically, we’ve collected both event and aggregate product usage data from GitLab.com. However, for GitLab Self-Managed and Dedicated instances, the absence of event data has required the GitLab Customer Success team to rely on manual data extraction methods to gather key insights, including job runtimes, runner usage for cost optimization, pipeline success rates, and deployment frequency for assessing DevSecOps maturity. Access to event-level data reduces the need for workarounds and enables more efficient reporting and optimizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: Throughout this blog, when we discuss event collection, we are exclusively referring to the collection of events for all features except those included in GitLab Duo. For more details, please refer to our <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/\">Customer Product Usage Information page</a>.</strong></p>\n<h2>Understanding event-level data</h2>\n<p>Event-level data tracks product usage interactions within the GitLab platform, such as initiating CI/CD pipelines, merging a merge request, triggering a webhook, or creating a new issue. User identifiers are pseudonymized to protect privacy, and GitLab does not undertake any processes to re-identify or associate the metrics with individual users. Importantly, event-level data does not include source code or other customer-created content stored within GitLab. To learn more, visit our <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/\">Customer Product Usage Information page</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a data sample we collect:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"event-level data - code example\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/1NAqnGWvTFy2NR1khYXohM/fdfeebc2ff8f31c0599055fdb1172df2/image2.png\" /></p>\n<h2>How event-level data collection benefits you</h2>\n<p>Event-level data offers a wealth of insights beyond what aggregated data can provide. It enables slicing and aggregating pseudonymized system instrumentation to identify trends, highlight unused or underused areas, and signal product improvements. By analyzing usage patterns in context, we can understand which features are used, how, and in what sequence. This visibility uncovers bottlenecks and optimization opportunities that aggregated data would miss.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In-depth feature usage analysis</strong><br />\nRather than just knowing which features are used weekly or monthly, event-level data provides a clearer picture of how users experience GitLab and the frequency of their usage. This enables us to gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and highlights areas for improvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Trend discovery</strong><br />\nEvent-level data helps identify trends in GitLab adoption that can’t be seen with rolling aggregates. With these insights, the GitLab Customer Success team can help customers make more informed decisions on feature adoption and usage, improving overall efficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Smarter product improvements</strong><br />\nEvent-level data gives GitLab’s Product team a clearer picture of real-world customer needs. By analyzing usage patterns, product improvements can be aligned with customer priorities, leading to continuous enhancements that make GitLab more powerful, efficient, and user-friendly.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom insights for your use case</strong><br />\nEvent-level data will enable GitLab Customer Success to provide tailored insights based on your organization's overall product usage without identifying individual users. This flexibility helps our teams provide recommendations that address your unique needs and challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>You stay in control of your data</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"event-level data - screen of choices\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5JuOn382Dm5ipWw4Rk0n6Y/0a896ba791d524cb4ae3131b4cd25afa/Screenshot_2025-04-02_at_12.14.12_PM.png\" /></p>\n<p>We’re committed to rolling this out with a strong focus on privacy. Here’s what we’re doing to ensure transparency and choice:</p>\n<p>✅ <strong>Pre-deployment early opt-out</strong> – Data sharing can be disabled by instance admins in the upcoming 17.11 release before event collection begins in 18.0. The pre-deployment early opt-out option will remain available after 18.0; just upgrade to 17.11 first and disable data sharing.</p>\n<p>✅ <strong>Proactive communication</strong> – Updates on the progress of this initiative will be shared via blog posts, emails to GitLab admins, and updates through your GitLab account team.</p>\n<p>✅ <strong>No third-party collectors</strong> - GitLab’s event-level instrumentation will not use any third-party collectors; it’s built and operated by GitLab, and events are sent directly to GitLab-managed environments, similar to <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/#service-ping-formerly-known-as-usage-ping\">Service Ping</a>.</p>\n<p>✅ <strong>Detailed documentation</strong> – Documentation will include clear guidelines on how to opt out, an easy-to-read summary outlining what data is collected, and a detailed view of the events and metrics collected.</p>\n<p>✅ <strong>De-identification approach</strong> – We will continue to apply aggregation and/or pseudonymization to any event-level data collected from Self-Managed and Dedicated.</p>\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pre-deployment early opt-out (17.11)</strong> – Starting in GitLab 17.11, customers can choose to turn off data sharing before event-level data collection begins.</li>\n<li><strong>Event-level data publishing (18.0)</strong> – Starting in GitLab 18.0, we plan to introduce event-level data publishing for Self-Managed and Dedicated instances. If you haven't opted out in 17.11, you will still have the option to do so in 18.0 and future releases.</li>\n<li><strong>Product enhancements (coming up!)</strong> - Improvements to GitLab user experiences and adoption insights made possible by event-level data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>We want to hear from you</h2>\n<p>Your feedback is essential in shaping this initiative. Let us know your thoughts, questions, or concerns <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/499215\">in this issue</a> so we can ensure this enhancement delivers the best value for GitLab Self-Managed and Dedicated users.</p>\n<p>By working together and gathering insights from real-world usage, we can make GitLab even more efficient, effective, and beneficial for your team.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This blog contains information related to upcoming products, features, and functionality.

Here's the high-level architecture:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SQL code is stored and version-controlled in GitLab.</li>\n<li>After code review and approval, GitLab CI/CD pipeline executes the code.</li>\n<li>The pipeline authenticates with Google Cloud.</li>\n<li>SQL queries are executed against BigQuery.</li>\n<li>Results are exported as CSV files to Google Cloud Storage.</li>\n<li>Secure links to these files are provided for authorized consumption.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, ensure you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Cloud APIs enabled:</strong> BigQuery API and Cloud Storage API</li>\n<li><strong>Service account</strong> with appropriate permissions:\n<ul>\n<li>BigQuery Job User</li>\n<li>Storage Admin</li>\n<li><strong>Note:</strong> For this demo, we're using the service account approach for authentication, which is simpler to set up. For production environments, you might consider using GitLab's identity and access management integration with Google Cloud. This integration leverages Workload Identity Federation, which provides enhanced security and is more suitable for enterprise customers and organizations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GitLab project</strong> ready to store your SQL code and pipeline configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step-by-step implementation</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Configure Google Cloud credentials.</strong></p>\n<p>First, set up the necessary environment variables in your GitLab project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your <strong>GitLab project &gt; Settings &gt; CI/CD</strong>.</li>\n<li>Expand the <strong>Variables</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Add the following variables:\n<ul>\n<li><code>GCS_BUCKET</code>: Your Google Cloud Storage bucket name</li>\n<li><code>GCP_PROJECT_ID</code>: Your Google Cloud project ID</li>\n<li><code>GCP_SA_KEY</code>: Base64-encoded service account key (mark as masked)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Create your SQL query.</strong></p>\n<p>Create a file named <code>query.sql</code> in your GitLab repository with your BigQuery SQL query. The query looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>-- This query shows a list of the daily top Google Search terms.\nSELECT\n   refresh_date AS Day,\n   term AS Top_Term,\n       -- These search terms are in the top 25 in the US each day.\n   rank,\nFROM `bigquery-public-data.google_trends.top_terms`\nWHERE\n   rank = 1\n       -- Choose only the top term each day.\n   AND refresh_date &gt;= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 2 WEEK)\n       -- Filter to the last 2 weeks.\nGROUP BY Day, Top_Term, rank\nORDER BY Day DESC\n   -- Show the days in reverse chronological order.\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>This query gets the top 25 search terms from Google Trends for the current day.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Configure the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.</strong></p>\n<p>Create a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file in your repository root:</p>\n<pre><code>image: google/cloud-sdk:alpine\n\ninclude:\n  - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml  # https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nexecute:\n  stage: deploy\n  script: \n    # Set up Google Cloud authentication and install necessary components\n    - export GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=$(echo $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY | base64 -d)\n    - echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS &gt; service-account-key.json \n    - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file service-account-key.json \n    - gcloud components install gsutil\n    # Set the active Google Cloud project\n    - gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID\n    # Run the BigQuery query and export the results to a CSV file\n    - bq query --format=csv --use_legacy_sql=false &lt; test.sql &gt; results.csv\n    # Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket if it doesn't exist\n    - gsutil ls gs://${CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET} || gsutil mb gs://${CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET}\n    # Upload the CSV file to the storage bucket\n    - gsutil cp results.csv gs://${CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET}/results.csv\n    # Set the access control list (ACL) to make the CSV file publicly readable\n    - gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://${CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET}/results.csv\n    # Define the static URL for the CSV file\n    - export STATIC_URL=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/${CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET}/results.csv&quot;\n    # Display the static URL for the CSV file\n    - echo &quot;File URL = $STATIC_URL&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>4. Run the pipeline.</strong></p>\n<p>Now, whenever changes are merged to your main branch, the pipeline will provide a link to the CSV file stored on the Google Cloud Storage bucket. This file contains the result of the executed SQL query that GitLab subjects to security checks.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of this approach</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> Authentication is handled automatically via service accounts (or Workload Identity Federation for enhanced security in production environments).</li>\n<li><strong>Auditability:</strong> All data exports are tracked through GitLab commits and pipeline logs.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeatability:</strong> Consistent, predictable export process on every run, and can be scheduled.</li>\n<li><strong>Version control:</strong> SQL queries are properly versioned and reviewed.</li>\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Significantly fewer manual exports, reducing human error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try it today</h2>\n<p>By combining GitLab's DevSecOps capabilities with Google Cloud's BigQuery and Cloud Storage, you've now automated and secured your data publishing workflow. This approach reduces manual operations, resolves permission headaches, and addresses security concerns – all achieved with just a few lines of GitLab CI code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use this tutorial's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/google-cloud/demos/big-query-data-publishing\">complete code example</a> to get started now.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The most significant change is the 100 pulls-per-6-hours limit for unauthenticated users.</p>\n<h2>What's changing?</h2>\n<p>Starting April 1, Docker will enforce the following pull rate limits:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>User type</th>\n<th>Pull rate limit per hour</th>\n<th>Number of public repositories</th>\n<th>Number of private repositories</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Business, Team, Pro (authenticated)</td>\n<td>Unlimited (fair use)</td>\n<td>Unlimited</td>\n<td>Unlimited</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Personal (authenticated)</td>\n<td>200 per 6-hour window</td>\n<td>Unlimited</td>\n<td>Up to 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unauthenticated users</td>\n<td>100 per 6-hour window per IPv4 address or IPv6 /64 subnet</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nThis is particularly important because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitLab's Dependency Proxy currently pulls from Docker Hub as an unauthenticated user.</li>\n<li>Most CI/CD pipelines that don't use the Dependency Proxy pull directly from Docker Hub as unauthenticated users.</li>\n<li>On hosted runners for GitLab.com, multiple users might share the same IP address or subnet, making them collectively subject to this limit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How this impacts GitLab users</h2>\n<p><strong>Impact on direct Docker Hub pulls</strong></p>\n<p>If your CI/CD pipelines directly pull images from Docker Hub without authentication, they will be limited to 100 pulls per six-hour window per IP address. For pipelines that run frequently or across multiple projects sharing the same runner infrastructure, this will quickly exhaust the limit and cause pipeline failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact on GitLab Dependency Proxy</strong></p>\n<p>The GitLab Dependency Proxy feature allows you to cache Docker images within GitLab to speed up pipelines and reduce external dependencies. However, the current implementation pulls from Docker Hub as an unauthenticated user, meaning it will also be subject to the 100 pulls-per-6-hours limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact on hosted runners</strong></p>\n<p>For hosted runners on GitLab.com, we use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/pull-cached-dockerhub-images\">Google Cloud's pull-through cache</a>. This mirrors the commonly pulled images and allows us to avoid rate limits. Job images defined as <code>image:</code> or <code>services:</code> in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file, are not affected by rate limits.</p>\n<p>Things are slightly more challenging whenever images are pulled within the runner environment. The most common use case to pull images during runner runtime is to build an image using Docker-in-Docker or Kaniko. In this scenario, the Docker Hub image defined in your <code>Dockerfile</code> is pulled directly from Docker Hub and is likely to be affected by rate limits.</p>\n<h2>How GitLab is responding</h2>\n<p>We're actively working on solutions to mitigate these challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dependency Proxy authentication:</strong> We've added support for Docker Hub authentication in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331741\">GitLab Dependency Proxy feature</a>. This will allow the Dependency Proxy to pull images from Docker Hub as an authenticated user, significantly increasing the rate limits.</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation updates:</strong> We've updated our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#configure-credentials\">documentation</a> to provide clear guidance on configuring pipeline authentication for Docker Hub.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal infrastructure preparation:</strong> We're preparing our internal infrastructure to minimize the impact on hosted runners for GitLab.com.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How you can prepare</h2>\n<p><strong>Option 1: Configure Docker Hub authentication in your pipelines</strong></p>\n<p>For pipelines that pull directly from Docker Hub, you can configure authentication to increase your rate limit to 200 pulls per six-hour window (or unlimited with a paid Docker Hub subscription).</p>\n<p>Add Docker Hub credentials to your project or group CI/CD variables (not in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file). Please refer to our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/docker/using_docker_images/#use-statically-defined-credentials\">documentation on using Docker images</a> for detailed instructions on setting up the <code>DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG</code> CI/CD variable correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2: Use the GitLab Container Registry</strong></p>\n<p>Consider pushing your frequently used Docker images to your <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/container_registry/\">GitLab Container Registry</a>. This eliminates the need to pull from Docker Hub during CI/CD runs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pull the image from Docker Hub.</li>\n<li>Tag it for your GitLab Container Registry.</li>\n<li>Push it to your GitLab Container Registry.</li>\n<li>Update your pipelines to pull from GitLab Container Registry.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>docker pull busybox:latest\ndocker tag busybox:latest $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/busybox:latest\ndocker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/busybox:latest\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>:</p>\n<p><code>image: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/busybox:latest</code></p>\n<p><strong>Option 3: Use GitLab Dependency Proxy</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab's Dependency Proxy feature provides a way to cache and proxy Docker images, reducing external dependencies and rate limit issues.</p>\n<p>Current authentication options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitLab 17.10: Configure Docker Hub authentication for the Dependency Proxy using <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#configure-credentials-using-the-graphql-api\">GraphQL API</a></li>\n<li>GitLab 17.11: Use the new UI-based configuration in your group's settings (already available on GitLab.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once authentication is properly configured, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure Docker Hub credentials in your group's Dependency Proxy settings:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>For GitLab 17.11+ (or current GitLab.com): Navigate to your group's settings &gt; Packages &amp; Registries &gt; Dependency Proxy.</li>\n<li>For GitLab 17.10: Use the GraphQL API to configure authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Update your pipelines to use the Dependency Proxy URLs in your CI/CD configuration:\n<code>image: ${CI_DEPENDENCY_PROXY_GROUP_IMAGE_PREFIX}/busybox:latest</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Option 4: Consider a Docker Hub paid subscription</strong></p>\n<p>For organizations with heavy Docker Hub usage, upgrading to a paid Docker subscription (Team or Business) will provide unlimited pulls, which may be the most straightforward solution.</p>\n<h2>Best practices to reduce Docker Hub rate limit impact</h2>\n<p>Regardless of which option you choose, consider these best practices to minimize Docker Hub rate limit impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use specific image tags instead of <code>latest</code> to avoid unnecessary pulls.</li>\n<li>Consolidate your Docker files to use the same base images across projects.</li>\n<li>Schedule less critical pipelines to run outside of peak hours.</li>\n<li>Use caching effectively to avoid pulling the same images repeatedly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to Docker Hub <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/pulls/#pull-definition\">documentation</a>, the pull count is incremented when pulling the image manifest, not based on image size or number of layers.</p>\n<h2>Timeline and next steps</h2>\n<p><strong>Now</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement authentication for direct Docker Hub pulls.</li>\n<li>GitLab.com users can already configure Docker Hub authentication for the Dependency Proxy using either:\n<ul>\n<li>The GraphQL API, or</li>\n<li>The UI in group settings</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self-managed GitLab 17.10 users can configure Dependency Proxy authentication using the GraphQL API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>April 1, 2025</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Docker Hub rate limits go into effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>April 17, 2025</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitLab 17.11 will be released with UI-based Dependency Proxy authentication support for self-managed instances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend taking action well before the April 1 deadline to avoid unexpected pipeline failures. For most users, configuring the Dependency Proxy with Docker Hub authentication is the most efficient long-term solution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have questions or need implementation help?

      "summary": "<p>The <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-operations/\">GitLab Security Operations team</a> prioritizes automation that enables security engineers to focus on high-impact work rather than routine tasks that can be automated. A key innovation in this automation strategy is creation of the User Attestation Module (UAM), which allows GitLab team members to directly respond to and verify security alerts flagged as potentially malicious. When the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/29/automating-cybersecurity-threat-detections-with-gitlab-ci-cd/\">GUARD framework</a> detects suspicious activity, it routes the alert to the relevant team member for review. The team member can then attest whether they recognize and authorize the activity. Their response is recorded for audit purposes, and, based on their input, the system either closes the alert or escalates it to the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT).</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll learn about the UAM and how it can benefit your DevSecOps environment.</p>\n<h2>How the User Attestation Module works</h2>\n<p>The UAM streamlines security alert handling through a comprehensive workflow that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alert verification by team members</li>\n<li>Collection and documentation of supporting evidence</li>\n<li>Option to request additional support from GitLab SecOps</li>\n<li>Secure storage of team member responses</li>\n<li>Automated alert resolution or incident escalation</li>\n<li>Team member feedback collection for continuous improvement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We created UAM to help us:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Route low priority alerts (such as administrative activities) to the relevant team members who performed them.</li>\n<li>Reduce alert fatigue by first checking with the team member who completed the activity before routing to SIRT if necessary.</li>\n<li>Collect and store team member responses to maintain an audit trail and rich metrics.</li>\n<li>Create a response tier between <strong>SIRT needs to triage this alert</strong> and <strong>This is an informational signal that does not need to be reviewed directly</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>UAM's design principles</h2>\n<p>The UAM is a Slack-first automation that reaches out to team members to validate activity directly in Slack, reducing effort and increasing participation. Today, 40% of all security alerts are delivered to team members through the UAM, saving SIRT valuable time to focus on higher importance alerts and incidents.</p>\n<p>A robust escalation workflow in the UAM ensures that all alerts are validated by team members or escalated to SIRT. When a UAM alert reaches a team member, they have a period of time to respond attesting to the activity or stating they do not recognize the activity. If no response is recorded, the UAM alert is auto-escalated to SIRT for handling.</p>\n<p>Comprehensive metrics collection is a core GUARD design principle, which extends to how we designed UAM. All user interactivity with triggered UAM alerts is logged in a metrics database, which enables comprehensive measurement to identify problematic alerts, opportunities for process improvement, and overall UAM health.</p>\n<p>UAM enables a third alert tier, bridging the gap between alerts that always needed to be investigated, and lower importance informational signals that are grouped by entity for escalation and correlation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stable alerts (must be triaged and investigated by SIRT)</li>\n<li>UAM alerts (routed to team members to attest to the activity)</li>\n<li>Informational signal (low-importance events that are interesting and correlated by entity grouping)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>UAM components</h2>\n<p>The UAM framework consists of multiple components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitLab: Fetches a user email address based on user_id via user’s API and stores user's responses  - Slack: Searches each user by email using Slack API and posts a UAM notification to the end user as well as collects responses from users using Slack modals</li>\n<li>Tines: Processes and orchestrates user responses and alerts</li>\n<li>Devo: Receives alert payload and alert notifications</li>\n<li>Metrics DB: Records metrics for triggered UAM alerts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workflow integrates with following modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitLab API for user identification</li>\n<li>Slack API for user communication</li>\n<li>Webhook configuration for alert reception</li>\n<li>Audit trail storage in GitLab</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>UAM workflow</h2>\n<p>The diagram below illustrates the workflow of the UAM module:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"UAM - flow chart\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/540ED2ZZYEgsio1IWEkC09/7a50bf8361079b9e20f1239550dd9b6f/UAM_detection_edited.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Following along with GUARD</h2>\n<p>We are still unveiling parts of GUARD and how it works, so <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-security-oss/guard\">follow along</a> to learn how we automate our security detections from end to end.</p>\n<h2>Read more about the GUARD framework</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/11/26/unveiling-the-guard-framework-to-automate-security-detections-at-gitlab/\">Unveiling the GUARD framework to automate security detections at GitLab</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/29/automating-cybersecurity-threat-detections-with-gitlab-ci-cd/\">Automating cybersecurity threat detections with GitLab CI/CD</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/security/open-source-resources/\">Open Source Security at GitLab</a></li>\n</ul>",

Let's look at a few notable highlights from this release, which includes contributions from GitLab's Git team and the wider Git community.</p>\n<p>What's covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#git-backfill(1)-and-the-new-path-walk-api\">git-backfill(1) and the new path-walk API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#introduction-of-zlib-ng\">Introduction of zlib-ng</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#continued-iteration-on-meson\">Continued iteration on Meson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#deprecation-of-.gitbranches%2F-and-.git%2Fremotes%2F\">Deprecation of .git/branches/ and .git/remotes/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#rust-bindings-for-libgit\">Rust bindings for libgit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#new-name-hashing-algorithm\">New name-hashing algorithm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#promisor-remote-capability\">Promisor remote capability</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#thin-clone-using---revision\">Thin clone using <code>--revision</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>git-backfill(1) and the new path-walk API</h2>\n<p>When you <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone\"><code>git-clone(1)</code></a> a Git repository,\nyou can pass it the\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt-code--filterltfilter-specgtcode\"><code>--filter</code></a>\noption. Using this option allows you to create a <em>partial clone</em>. In a partial\nclone the server only sends a subset of reachable objects according to the given\nobject filter. For example, creating a clone with <code>--filter=blob:none</code> will not\nfetch any blobs (file contents) from the server and create a <em>blobless clone</em>.</p>\n<p>Blobless clones have all the reachable commits and trees, but no blobs. When you\nperform an operation like\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout\"><code>git-checkout(1)</code></a>, Git will download\nthe missing blobs to complete that operation. For some operations, like\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame\"><code>git-blame(1)</code></a>, this might result in\ndownloading objects one by one, which will slow down the command drastically.\nThis performance degradation occurs because <code>git-blame(1)</code> must traverse the\ncommit history to identify which specific blobs it needs, then request each\nmissing blob from the server separately.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.49, a new subcommand <code>git-backfill(1)</code> is introduced, which can be\nused to download missing blobs in a blobless partial clone.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, the <code>git-backfill(1)</code> command leverages the new path-walk API, which is different from how Git generally iterates over commits. Rather than iterating over the commits one at a time and recursively visiting the trees and blobs associated with each commit, the path-walk API does traversal by path. For each path, it adds a list of associated tree objects to a stack. This stack is then processed in a depth-first order. So, instead of processing every object in commit <code>1</code> before moving to commit <code>2</code>, it will process all versions of file <code>A</code> across all commits before moving to file <code>B</code>. This approach greatly improves performance in scenarios where grouping by path is essential.</p>\n<p>Let me demonstrate its use by making a blobless clone of <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git\"><code>gitlab-org/git</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">$ git clone --filter=blob:none --bare --no-tags git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/git.git\nCloning into bare repository 'git.git'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 245904, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (1736/1736), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (276/276), done.\nremote: Total 245904 (delta 1591), reused 1547 (delta 1459), pack-reused 244168 (from 1)\nReceiving objects: 100% (245904/245904), 59.35 MiB | 15.96 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (161482/161482), done.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Above, we use <code>--bare</code> to ensure Git doesn't need to download any blobs to check\nout an initial branch.

Created in 1995, <code>zlib</code> has a long history and is incredibly\nportable, even supporting many systems that predate the Internet. Because of its\nwide support of architectures and compilers, it has limitations in what it is\ncapable of.</p>\n<p>The fork <a href=\"https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng\"><code>zlib-ng</code></a> was created to\naccommodate the limitations. <code>zlib-ng</code> aims to be optimized for modern\nsystems. This fork drops support for legacy systems and instead brings in\npatches for Intel optimizations, some Cloudflare optimizations, and a couple\nother smaller patches.</p>\n<p>The <code>zlib-ng</code> library itself provides a compatibility layer for <code>zlib</code>. The\ncompatibility later allows <code>zlib-ng</code> to be a drop-in replacement for <code>zlib</code>, but\nthat layer is not available on all Linux distributions. In Git 2.49:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A compatibility layer was added to the Git project.</li>\n<li>Build options were added to both to the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/blob/b9d6f64393275b505937a8621a6cc4875adde8e0/Makefile#L186-187\"><code>Makefile</code></a>\nand <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/blob/b9d6f64393275b505937a8621a6cc4875adde8e0/meson.build#L795-811\">Meson Build file</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These additions make it easier to benefit from the performance improvements of\n<code>zlib-ng</code>.</p>\n<p>In local benchmarks, we've seen a ~25% speedup when using <code>zlib-ng</code> instead of <code>zlib</code>.

This library\ncontains some of the core functionality of Git.</p>\n<p>While this library (and most of Git) is written in C, in Git 2.49 bindings were\nadded to make some of these functions available in Rust. To achieve this, two\nnew Cargo packages were created: <code>libgit-sys</code> and <code>libgit-rs</code>. These packages\nlive in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/tree/master/contrib\"><code>contrib/</code></a> subdirectory in the Git source tree.</p>\n<p>It's pretty\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages\">common</a>\nto split out a library into two packages when a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface\">Foreign Function\nInterface</a> is used.\nThe <code>libgit-sys</code> package provides the pure interface to C functions and links to\nthe native <code>libgit.a</code> library. The package <code>libgit-rs</code> provides a high-level\ninterface to the functions in <code>libgit-sys</code> with a feel that is more idiomatic to\nRust.</p>\n<p>So far, the functionality in these Rust packages is very limited. It only\nprovides an interface to interact with the <code>git-config(1)</code>.</p>\n<p>This initiative was led by <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/8793ff64a7f6c4c04dd03b71162a85849feda944.1738187176.git.steadmon@google.com/\">Josh Steadmon</a> and was merged with <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/a4af0b6288e25eb327ae9018cee09def9e43f1cd\">a4af0b6288</a>.</p>\n<h2>New name-hashing algorithm</h2>\n<p>The Git object database in <code>.git/</code> stores most of its data in packfiles. And\npackfiles are also used to submit objects between Git server and client over the\nwire.</p>\n<p>You can read all about the format at\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitformat-pack\"><code>gitformat-pack(5)</code></a>. One important\naspect of the packfiles is delta-compression. With delta-compression not every\nobject is stored as-is, but some objects are saved as a <em>delta</em> of another\n<em>base</em>. So instead of saving the full contents of the objects, changes compared\nto another object are stored.</p>\n<p>Without going into the details how these deltas are calculated or stored, you\ncan imagine that it is important group files together that are very similar. In\nv2.48 and earlier, Git looked at the last 16 characters of the path name to\ndetermine whether blobs might be similar. This algorithm is named version <code>1</code>.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.49, version <code>2</code> is available. This is an iteration on version <code>1</code>, but\nmodified so the effect of the parent directory is reduced. You can specify the\nname-hash algorithm version you want to use with option <code>--name-hash-version</code> of\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-repack\"><code>git-repack(1)</code></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stolee.dev/\">Derrick Stolee</a>, who drove this project, did some\ncomparison in resulting packfile size after running <code>git repack -adf --name-hash-version=&lt;n&gt;</code>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Repo</th>\n<th>Version 1 size</th>\n<th>Version 2 size</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui\">fluentui</a></td>\n<td>440 MB</td>\n<td>161 MB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repo B</td>\n<td>6,248 MB</td>\n<td>856 MB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repo C</td>\n<td>37,278 MB</td>\n<td>6,921 MB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repo D</td>\n<td>131,204 MB</td>\n<td>7,463 MB</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can read more of the details in the <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1823.v4.git.1738004554.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/\">patch\nset</a>,\nwhich is merged in\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/aae91a86fb2a71ff89a71b63ccec3a947b26ca51\">aae91a86fb</a>.</p>\n<h2>Promisor remote capability</h2>\n<p>It's known that Git isn't great in dealing with large files. There are some\nsolutions to this problem, like <a href=\"https://git-lfs.com/\">Git LFS</a>, but there are\nstill some shortcomings. To give a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With Git LFS the user has to configure which files to put in LFS. The server has\nno control about that and has to serve all files.</li>\n<li>Whenever a file is committed to the repository, there is no way to get it out\nagain without rewriting history. This is annoying, especially for large files,\nbecause they are stuck for eternity.</li>\n<li>Users cannot change their mind on which files to put into Git LFS.</li>\n<li>A tool like Git LFS requires significant effort to set up, learn, and use\ncorrectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For some time, Git has had the concept of promisor remotes. This feature can be used to deal with large files, and in Git 2.49 this feature took a step forward.</p>\n<p>The idea for the new “promisor-remote” capability is relatively simple: Instead of sending all\nobjects itself, a Git server can tell to the Git client &quot;Hey, go download these\nobjects from <em>XYZ</em>&quot;. <em>XYZ</em> would be a promisor remote.</p>\n<p>Git 2.49 enables the server to advertise the information of the promisor remote\nto the client. This change is an extension to\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitprotocol-v2\"><code>gitprotocol-v2</code></a>. While the server\nand the client are transmitting data to each other, the server can send  names and URLs of the promisor remotes it knows\nabout.</p>\n<p>So far, the client is not using the promisor remote info it gets from the server during clone, so all\nobjects are still transmitted from the remote the clone initiated from. We are planning to continue work on this feature, making it use promisor remote info from the server, and making it easier to use.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250218113204.2847463-1-christian.couder@gmail.com/\">patch\nset</a>\nwas submitted by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/chriscool\">Christian Couder</a> and merged\nwith\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/2c6fd30198187c928cbf927802556908c381799c\">2c6fd30198</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thin clone using <code>--revision</code></h2>\n<p>A new <code>--revision</code> option was added to\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone\"><code>git-clone(1)</code></a>. This enables you to create\na thin clone of a repository that only contains the history of the given\nrevision. The option is similar to <code>--branch</code>, but accepts a ref name (like\n<code>refs/heads/main</code>, <code>refs/tags/v1.0</code>, and <code>refs/merge-requests/123</code>) or a\nhexadecimal commit object ID. The difference to <code>--branch</code> is that it does not\ncreate a tracking branch and detaches <code>HEAD</code>. This means it's not suited if you\nwant to contribute back to that branch.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>--revision</code> in combination with <code>--depth</code> to create a very minimal\nclone. A suggested use-case is for automated testing. When you have a CI system\nthat needs to check out a branch (or any reference) to perform autonomous\ntesting on the source code, having a minimal clone is all you need.</p>\n<p>This\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/commit/5785d9143bcb3ef19452a83bc2e870ff3d5ed95a\">change</a>\nwas\n<a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250206-toon-clone-refs-v7-0-4622b7392202@iotcl.com/\">driven</a>\nby <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/toon\">Toon Claes</a>.</p>\n<h1>Read more</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/10/whats-new-in-git-2-48-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.48.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/10/07/whats-new-in-git-2-47-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.47.0?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/07/29/whats-new-in-git-2-46-0/\">What’s new in Git 2.46.0?</a></li>\n</ul>",

However, as applications grow, so do their infrastructure and scaling requirements. Managing multiple clusters to handle large-scale workloads introduces operational complexity, increased network management, and challenges for the DevOps teams. These challenges can include greater resource fragmentation, increased latency due to inter-cluster communication, and the manual burden of maintaining security and compliance across multiple clusters.  These challenges are particularly pronounced for data-intensive workloads like video streaming, large-scale data analytics, and security operations.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to announce a major evolution of DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS), which consists of four features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Increased cluster capacity to 1,000 worker nodes per cluster</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Managed Cilium for high-performance networking</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These updates help to empower businesses to run larger workloads within a single DOKS cluster, reducing the need for complex multi-cluster management and unlocking new levels of performance, reliability, and simplicity.</p>\n<p>NoBid, a Kubernetes customer who joined us at Deploy 2025, has seen significant improvements in scalability and security when deploying DOKS. “DigitalOcean Kubernetes provides NoBid with a powerful platform for our containerized workloads,&quot; said Shawn Petersen, CIO at NoBid. “Additionally, the ability to rapidly scale based on business demand, handle 1.3 PB/month in data egress, along with better security controls were all key differentiators for us to partner with DigitalOcean.&quot; If you want to learn more about NoBid’s use case, <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/customers/nobid\">check out their case study.</a> Also, you can learn more about their migration from AWS to DigitalOcean and their subsequent 30% cost-savings by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVjg4aBnLlw\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">watching the testimonial they gave at Deploy 2025.</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"an-overview-of-each-new-feature-and-what-it-means-for-your-business\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#an-overview-of-each-new-feature-and-what-it-means-for-your-business\">An overview of each new feature, and what it means for your business</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#an-overview-of-each-new-feature-and-what-it-means-for-your-business\"></a></h1>\n<p>This announcement consists of four features that are new and coming to DOKS. It is important to understand and differentiate each one thoroughly, which is what the text below will do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"increased-cluster-capacity\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#increased-cluster-capacity\">Increased cluster capacity</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#increased-cluster-capacity\"></a></h2>\n<p>The first feature increases cluster capacity. We’ve doubled the maximum worker node count per cluster from 500 to 1,000, enabling businesses to scale effortlessly while keeping infrastructure streamlined and cost-efficient. With this increased cluster capacity, you no longer need to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters just to scale your workloads. This simplifies operations, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures a more consistent application performance across environments. Now, developers can deploy larger, data-intensive applications on a single DOKS cluster, simplifying operations and enhancing scalability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optimized-networking-with-vpc-native-kubernetes\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimized-networking-with-vpc-native-kubernetes\">Optimized networking with VPC-native Kubernetes</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#optimized-networking-with-vpc-native-kubernetes\"></a></h2>\n<p>The second feature we’re bringing to you is VPC-native Kubernetes, which assigns IP addresses directly from your virtual private cloud (VPC) address pool. This feature enables native routing between cluster and VPC resources, seamlessly integrating DOKS clusters with your existing network architecture. This enhances network performance, simplifies inter-cluster communication, and removes the need for complex network configurations—allowing your workloads to operate more efficiently. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/digitalocean-doks-managed-kubernetes-networking\">You can read more about this feature in our earlier blog post.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"improved-performance-with-ebpf-powered-networking\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#improved-performance-with-ebpf-powered-networking\">Improved performance with eBPF-powered networking</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#improved-performance-with-ebpf-powered-networking\"></a></h2>\n<p>The third feature now replaces kube-proxy with eBPF-based routing, significantly improving data plane processing, bandwidth efficiency, and network latency. Unlike traditional packet filtering methods, eBPF enables high-performance, in-kernel processing, which reduces context switching overhead and accelerates packet processing times. Overall, this feature is especially beneficial for high-volume applications, such as real-time analytics, transaction-heavy workloads, and microservices architectures that require low-latency communication between services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"managed-cilium-for-high-performance-networking\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#managed-cilium-for-high-performance-networking\">Managed Cilium for high-performance networking</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#managed-cilium-for-high-performance-networking\"></a></h2>\n<p>The fourth feature is bringing Managed Cilium to DOKS for high-performance networking. With fully-managed Cilium running on the control plane, developers enjoy enhanced security, reliability, and scalability. By reducing operational complexity, businesses can focus on innovation rather than managing networking infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of Cilium Hubble provides enhanced network observability, making troubleshooting and performance optimization easier than ever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-this-means-for-your-business\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-this-means-for-your-business\">What this means for your business</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-this-means-for-your-business\"></a></h2>\n<p>Overall, this next evolution of our Kubernetes service will significantly enhance your environment, benefiting developers and decision-makers alike.</p>\n<p><strong>For your environment:</strong> Experience greater scalability, improved performance, and simplified networking, allowing applications to run more efficiently with reduced operational overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>For your developers:</strong> Enjoy a seamless experience with better observability, enhanced security, and less complexity in managing networking infrastructure.

This network infrastructure advantage, combined with DigitalOcean’s reliable network connectivity, creates an ideal environment for EU-based companies to provide their customers with AI applications and features that feel frictionless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-at-the-core\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#privacy-at-the-core\">Privacy at the core</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#privacy-at-the-core\"></a></h2>\n<p>Building AI systems and tooling for European markets means making sense of complex regulatory requirements for data protection and sovereignty. Our commitment to privacy is unwavering in this regard. By using our Amsterdam data center’s Bare Metal GPUs, your data never leaves the EU. Some European industries face additional sector-specific regulations that require data to remain within certain jurisdictions. Banking, healthcare, and government organizations often need to demonstrate clear data sovereignty as part of their operational requirements.</p>\n<div class=\"callout info\">\n<p>Customer proprietary data uploaded to our services remains within the region where customers choose to host such data, providing straightforward data sovereignty for EU workloads.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Data sovereignty is also becoming a competitive differentiator. European customers increasingly prefer services that process their data locally, viewing data residency as an indicator of greater security and trustworthiness. A 2023 report from the <a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2023-051_consumer_attitudes_to_health_data.pdf\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">European Consumer Organisation</a> found resistance in France and Germany to share health data across borders, with just 34% of respondents in both countries willing to share their data with other countries.</p>\n<p>By running AI workloads on our Bare Metal GPUs in Amsterdam, your team can develop tools with AI capabilities while maintaining the clear chain of data custody that regulators require. Whether you’re an EU-based startup or an international company serving customers across Europe, keeping data processing within EU borders helps you simplify your compliance strategy and help you meet regional expectations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-benefits-of-bare-metal-for-ai-ml-workloads\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#the-benefits-of-bare-metal-for-ai-ml-workloads\">The benefits of bare metal for AI/ML workloads</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#the-benefits-of-bare-metal-for-ai-ml-workloads\"></a></h2>\n<p>Our Bare Metal GPUs provide direct access to dedicated hardware with no abstraction layers or resource sharing, delivering maximum performance for intensive AI development work.

In 2024, Hatch significantly revamped the program to better support those building businesses in the artificial intelligence sector, providing AI/ML startups with discounts for <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gpu-droplets\">GPU Droplets</a> and free access to DigitalOcean’s premium support in addition to credits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://exh.ai/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ex-human</a>, a startup building empathetic generative AI solutions backed by A16Z GAMES’ SPEEDRUN accelerator, chose the Hatch program to help serve their customers with AI models—read on to hear about their experience with Hatch so far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"from-film-to-the-future\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#from-film-to-the-future\">From film to the future</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#from-film-to-the-future\"></a></h2>\n<p>Inspired by the characters Sam from <em>Her (2013)</em> and Joi from <em>Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</em>, Artem Rodichev, founder and CEO of Ex-human, sought to build a future where humans interact with digital humans and characters on a daily basis, taking the form of friends, mentors, lovers, and more. After a stint at Replika, Rodichev saw that humans were building deeper connections with their AI companions and wanted to create a solution that was both viable for consumers and businesses.</p>\n<p>Ex-human brings their AI characters to life through text, images, video, and audio with unlimited scalability and customizability that opens up possibilities for numerous use cases. Partnering with companies such as Grindr, who are using Ex-human’s technology to bring an AI wingman to life, this technology has the opportunity to help humans form stronger bonds in both physical and digital worlds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\">Innovation shouldn’t come at a high cost</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#innovation-shouldn-t-come-at-a-high-cost\"></a></h2>\n<p>Building AI technology requires large amounts of computing power, which can come at a high price, especially for a new business. Ex-human chose the Hatch program because it offers exclusive pricing for access to on-demand NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplets at <strong>$1.90/GPU/hour</strong>*. Despite the favorable cost, Ex-human finds that there are no tradeoffs with power and reliability, giving them a solution that works for their budget and delivers for their needs. Ex-human uses GPU Droplets to serve their LLMs so customers can take advantage of their technology’s power.</p>\n<p>“DigitalOcean’s GPU Droplets are great. 99% of the time, it [is] used for serving our LLMs. I don’t think we have any trouble with unavailability, network issues, or stuff like that with DigitalOcean. We found DigitalOcean to be more intuitive and simpler than working with AWS or Google Cloud. It’s simple, not expensive, and reliable.” – Artem Rodichev, Founder and CEO @ Ex-human</p>\n<p>GPU Droplets allow for users to build, train, and scale their AI/ML workloads with ease. Through the Hatch program, you can access vast amounts of computational power without having to break the bank.</p>\n<p>Hatch startups also receive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Up to $100,000 in compute credits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three months free of one NVIDIA H100x8 GPU Droplet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complimentary premium support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GenAI usage with Hatch credits</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Note that GPU Droplet usage will not be covered by Hatch compute credits. This pricing is only eligible for startups who are a part of the Hatch program, only applies to on-demand NVIDIA H100 GPU Droplets, and is accurate as of 3/7/2025. Pricing is subject to change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"musings-from-the-founder\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#musings-from-the-founder\">Musings from the founder</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#musings-from-the-founder\"></a></h2>\n<p>As a founder, Rodichev uses his deep expertise in AI/ML to guide Ex-human’s business and vision. While leading product development, he works alongside a talented team handling engineering, marketing, sales, investor relations, and everything in between. It’s hard work, but it’s deeply rewarding.</p>\n<p>Rodichev: “My number one advice–don’t start a startup. [laughs] The number two advice–do it if that’s the only thing you can do. If you really have a chip on your shoulder, if you really want to change the world in a way that you see how the world will develop, if you really want to build this kind of feature and no one else can build it, go start a startup.”</p>\n<p>The simplicity and reliability of DigitalOcean’s products affords founders like Rodichev to focus on things outside of managing their product’s infrastructure so they can build the future at full speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Interested in joining the Hatch program to grow your startup?

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/10551\">#10551</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">@rumstead</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/#default-resourceexclusions-configurations\">Ignore differences on high churn controller managed resources</a> like those from Cert Manager, Kyverno, Cilium, and Kubernetes.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

This also allows for leveraging better naming convention, for example when the name of the team is present both in the ArgoCD Project and the Application Namespaces.

This is your big opportunity to make your voice heard and help Argo CD to become even better.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*w9rgGKfx4xouoCzr\" /></figure><h3>Multi-source application advancements</h3><p>Creating Argo CD applications <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">from multiple sources</a> was one of the most requested Argo CD features for a long time. This feature allows you to group information from multiple places (for example a public Helm chart plus your local values file) to form a single Argo CD application. Initial support for defining multiple sources was already added in Argo CD version 2.6, and the support for CLI was added in 2.11. The UI still assumed the application to have a single source and certain CLI features like rollback were not yet supported for an application with multiple sources.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, rollback of a multiple source application is now possible via both Argo CD UI and CLI.</p><p>In addition to the rollback feature, a new Sources tab has been added to the Application Details page, enabling users to manage (view and edit) the sources of an application.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mj0F_f8U8TQMhzvN\" /></figure><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/keithchong\">Keith Chong</a> (Red Hat) and <a href=\"https://github.com/JorTurFer\">Jorge Turrado</a> for implementing these features.</p><h3>Project Scoped Repository Credential Improvements</h3><p>Currently, multiple repository credentials sharing the same URL is not allowed by the Argo CD API. If the credentials are added directly to the argocd namespace, argocd-server won’t return an error, but this still does not work since the first secret that matches a repository URL is the one that gets returned, and the order is also undefined.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, Argo CD will allow multiple app projects to have the ability to have separate repository credentials having the same URL.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">Blake Pettersson</a> (Akuity) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Add labels for Kubernetes events</h3><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, users will be able to expose application labels on k8s events generated by Argo CD. When the events are created for Applications that have specific label keys defined in `resource.includeEventLabelKeys`, the controller will attach the matching labels to the events. This connection will make it simpler to filter or process the events based on the applications using these labels.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/svghadi\">Siddhesh Ghadi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Consistent Sharding Algorithm</h3><p>Argo CD provides the capability to employ sharding for different Argo CD application controllers. This allows you to assign specific clusters to specific controllers to distribute the load across the different shards.</p><p>The existing sharding algorithms, including the legacy method and the round-robin algorithm, have shown limitations in maintaining optimal load distribution and minimizing unnecessary cluster-to-shard assignment changes.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, a new sharding algorithm named “consistent-hashing” is introduced which reduces Cluster-to-Shard Assignment Changes and optimizes resource utilization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/akram\">Akram Ben Aissi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p>Here are some other new changes that made it into the release</p><ul><li>Updates to git client for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17566\">resolving semantic versioning tags</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/thepabloaguilar\">Pablo Aguilar</a> from Stone Payments)</li><li>Application Set Git Generator now supports <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18545\">GPG signature verification</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/ishitasequeira\">Ishita Sequeira</a> from Red Hat)</li><li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18250\">ls-remote request fail</a> metric (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>)</li><li>Add new<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/pull/560\"> annotation argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Force=true</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/kkk777-7\">Kota Kimura</a> from CyberAgent, Inc.)</li><li>Add support for setting a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17728\">grpc message size as an environment variable</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pavel Kostohrys</a> from Codefresh)</li><li>Display the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18116\">list of dependent resources</a> in the delete popup (by <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a> from Intuit)</li><li>Remove support for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/13203\">old tracking label</a> <em>applications.argoproj.io/app-name</em> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">Soumya Ghosh Dastidar</a> from Akuity)</li><li>Add support for<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18484\"> fish shell completion</a> to Argo CD CLI (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Sn0rt\">Sn0rt</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18657\">Skip calling git fetch</a> if the commit to checkout exists locally (by <a href=\"https://github.com/shady-canva\">Shady Rafehi</a>)</li></ul><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.12.0-rc1\">release notes</a>, and <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.11-2.12/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

indicate the status of <code>parentRefs</code> for service and service entry resources,\nas well as a new condition to indicate the status of waypoint configuration when in ambient mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> validation webhook rejecting an otherwise valid <code>connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s</code> configuration.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409\">Issue #55409</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>HTTPRoute</code> status was not reporting a <code>parentRef</code> associated with a single result\ndue to complex logic for collapsing <code>parentRefs</code> of the same reference, but different <code>sectionNames</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> <code>IstioCertificateService</code> to ensure <code>IstioCertificateResponse.CertChain</code> contained only a single certificate per element in the array.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/ztunnel/issues/1061\">Issue #1061</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing waypoints to downgrade HTTP2 traffic to HTTP/1.1 if the port was not explicitly declared as <code>http2</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

<code>ext_proc</code> is configured via <code>EnvoyFilter</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes\">Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug with mixed-case Hosts in Gateway and TLS redirect resulted in stale RDS.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49638\">Issue #49638</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Ambient <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policies were overly strict.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53884\">Issue #53884</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> failure to patch managed gateway/waypoint deployments during upgrade to 1.24.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54145\">Issue #54145</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in where multiple <code>STRICT</code> port-level mTLS rules in an ambient mode <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policy would effectively result\nin a permissive policy due to incorrect evaluation logic (AND vs. OR).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54146\">Issue #54146</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the wording of the status message when L7 rules are present in an AuthorizationPolicy which is bound to ztunnel, to be clearer.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54334\">Issue #54334</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the request mirror filter incorrectly computed the percentage.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54357\">Issue #54357</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where using a tag in the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label on a gateway caused the gateway to be improperly programmed, and to lack status.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54458\">Issue #54458</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where out-of-order ztunnel disconnects could put <code>istio-cni</code> in a state where it believes it has no connections.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54544\">Issue #54544</a>),(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53843\">Issue #53843</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access log order caused instability during connection draining.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54672\">Issue #54672</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the gateway chart where <code>--set platform</code> worked but <code>--set global.platform</code> did not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient mode destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the <code>istio-iptables</code> command to fail when a non-built-in table is present in the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing configuration to be rejected when there is a partial overlap between IP addresses across multiple services.\nFor example, a Service with <code>[IP-A]</code> and one with <code>[IP-B, IP-A]</code>.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52847\">Issue #52847</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>.\nBefore, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the\n1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> validation webhook rejecting an otherwise valid configuration <code>connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409\">Issue #55409</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

id=\"dns-proxying-on-by-default-for-ambient-mode\">DNS proxying on by default for ambient mode</h3>\n<p>Istio will generally route traffic based on HTTP headers. In ambient mode, the ztunnel only sees traffic at Layer 4, and does not have access to HTTP headers. Therefore, DNS proxying is required to enable resolution of <code>ServiceEntry</code> addresses, especially in the case of <a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Troubleshooting-Istio-Ambient#scenario-ztunnel-is-not-sending-egress-traffic-to-waypoints\">sending egress traffic to waypoints</a>.</p>\n<p>To make this easier in the default case, DNS proxying is enabled by default in ambient mode installations of Istio 1.25.  An annotation has been added to allow workloads to opt out of DNS proxying. Check the <a href=\"/news/releases/1.25.x/announcing-1.25/upgrade-notes/#ambient-mode-dns-capture-on-by-default\">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"default-deny-policy-available-for-waypoints\">Default deny policy available for waypoints</h3>\n<p>In sidecar mode, authorization policy is attached to workloads via a selector. In ambient mode, policy targeted by selector is enforced by ztunnel only. Waypoint proxies use Gateway API-style binding using the <code>targetRef</code> field. This led to a potential configuration where a workload was default-denied the ability to talk to an endpoint, but could bypass that configuration by connecting to a waypoint that <em>was</em> allowed to talk to that endpoint, and thus reach it anyway.</p>\n<p>In this release, we have added the ability to target policy to a named <code>GatewayClass</code>, as well as a named <code>Gateway</code>. This allows you to set policy on the <code>istio-waypoint</code> class, which apply to all instances of a waypoint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zonal-routing-enhancements\">Zonal routing enhancements</h3>\n<p>Whether for reliability, performance, or cost reasons, controlling cross-zone and cross-region traffic is often an important &ldquo;day 2&rdquo; operation for users. With Istio 1.25, this just got even easier!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#traffic-distribution\">Kubernetes&rsquo;s traffic distribution</a> feature is now fully supported, offering a simplified interface to keep traffic local. The existing Istio <a href=\"/docs/tasks/traffic-management/locality-load-balancing/\">locality load balancing</a> settings remain available for more complex use cases.</p>\n<p>In ambient mode, ztunnel will now report the additional <code>source_zone</code>, <code>source_region</code>, <code>destination_zone</code>, and <code>destination_region</code> labels to all metrics, giving a clear view of cross-zonal traffic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-new-features\">Other new features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We have added the ability to provide a list of virtual interfaces whose inbound traffic will be unconditionally treated as outbound. This allows workloads using virtual networking (KubeVirt, VMs, docker-in-docker, etc) to function correctly with both sidecar and ambient mode traffic capture.</li>\n<li>The <code>istio-cni</code> DaemonSet can now be safely upgraded in-place in an active cluster, without requiring a node cordon to prevent pods spawned during the upgrade process from escaping ambient traffic capture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"/news/releases/1.25.x/announcing-1.25/change-notes/\">the full change notes</a> for everything else that is new.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-125\">Upgrading to 1.25</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.25.

      "summary": "<p>When upgrading from Istio 1.24.x to Istio 1.25.x, please consider the changes on this page.\nThese notes detail the changes which purposefully break backwards compatibility with Istio 1.24.x.\nThe notes also mention changes which preserve backwards compatibility while introducing new behavior.\nChanges are only included if the new behavior would be unexpected to a user of Istio 1.24.x.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ambient-mode-pod-upgrade-reconciliation\">Ambient mode pod upgrade reconciliation</h2>\n<p>When a new <code>istio-cni</code> <code>DaemonSet</code> pod starts up, it will inspect pods that were previously enrolled in the ambient mesh, and upgrade their in-pod iptables rules to the current state if there is a diff or delta. This is off by default as of 1.25.0, but will eventually be enabled by default. This feature can be enabled by <code>helm install cni --set ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code> (Helm) or <code>istioctl install --set values.cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code> (istioctl).</p>\n<h2 id=\"dns-traffic-tcp-and-udp-now-respects-traffic-exclusion-annotations\">DNS traffic (TCP and UDP) now respects traffic exclusion annotations</h2>\n<p>DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) now respects pod-level traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. This behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ambient-mode-dns-capture-on-by-default\">Ambient mode DNS capture on by default</h2>\n<p>DNS proxying is enabled by default for ambient mode workloads in this release. Note that only new pods will have DNS enabled: existing pods will not have their DNS traffic captured. To enable this feature for existing pods, they must either be manually restarted, or alternatively the iptables reconciliation feature can be enabled when upgrading <code>istio-cni</code> via <code>--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code>. This will reconcile existing pods automatically on upgrade.</p>\n<p>Individual pods may opt-out of global ambient mode DNS capture by applying the<code>ambient.istio.io/dns-capture=false</code> annotation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grafana-dashboard-changes\">Grafana dashboard changes</h2>\n<p>The dashboards shipped with Istio 1.25 require version 7.2 or later of Grafana.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opencensus-support-has-been-removed\">OpenCensus support has been removed</h2>\n<p>Because Envoy has <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.33/v1.33.0.html#incompatible-behavior-changes\">removed the OpenCensus tracing extension</a>, we have\nremoved OpenCensus support from Istio.

Please consider upgrading your environment to remove the deprecated functionality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deprecated</strong> use of <code>ISTIO_META_DNS_AUTO_ALLOCATE</code> in <code>proxyMetadata</code> in favor of a newer version of <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/dns-proxy/#address-auto-allocation\">DNS auto-allocation</a>. New users of Istio IP <code>auto-allocation</code> should adopt the new status based controller.

This can be disabled explicitly or with <code>compatibilityVersion=1.24</code>.\nNote: only new pods will have DNS enabled. To enable for existing pods, pods must be manually restarted, or the iptables reconciliation feature must be enabled with <code>--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> the <code>PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE</code> value to default to <code>true</code>.\nThis enables the new iteration of <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/dns-proxy/#address-auto-allocation\">IP auto-allocation</a>,\nfixing long-standing issues around allocation instability, ambient support, and increased visibility.\n<code>ServiceEntry</code> objects without <code>spec.address</code> set will now see a new field, <code>status.addresses</code>, automatically set.\nNote: these will not be used unless proxies are configured to do DNS proxying, which remains off-by-default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the <code>PILOT_SEND_UNHEALTHY_ENDPOINTS</code> feature (which is off by default) to not include terminating endpoints.\nThis ensures a service is not considered unhealthy during scale down or rollout events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> DNS proxying algorithm to randomly select which upstream to forward DNS requests to.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53414\">Issue #53414</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> new istiod environment variable <code>PILOT_DNS_JITTER_DURATION</code> that sets jitter for periodic DNS resolution.\nSee <code>dns_jitter</code> in <code>https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52877\">Issue #52877</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>ObservedGeneration</code> to ambient status conditions.

This value defaults to 100 when unset.\nFor more information, see <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/network/dns_resolver/cares/v3/cares_dns_resolver.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-network-dns-resolver-cares-v3-caresdnsresolverconfig-udp-max-queries\">Envoy documentation</a>\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53577\">Issue #53577</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for reconciling in-pod iptables rules of existing ambient pods from the previous version on <code>istio-cni</code> upgrade. Feature can be toggled with <code>--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code>, and will be enabled by default in future releases.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/1360\">Issue #1360</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>istio.io/reroute-virtual-interfaces</code> annotation, a comma separated list of virtual interfaces whose inbound traffic will be unconditionally treated as outbound. This allows workloads using virtual networking (KubeVirt, VMs, docker-in-docker, etc) to function correctly with both sidecar and ambient mesh traffic capture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for attaching policy defaults for istio-waypoint by targeting the <code>GatewayClass</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54696\">Issue #54696</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>ambient.istio.io/dns-capture</code> annotation, which may be unset, or set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.\nWhen specified on a <code>Pod</code> enrolled in ambient mesh, controls whether DNS traffic (TCP and UDP on port 53) will be captured and proxied in ambient.\nThis pod-level annotation, if present on a pod, will override the global <code>istio-cni</code> <code>AMBIENT_DNS_CAPTURE</code> setting, which as of 1.25 defaults to <code>true</code>.\nNote: setting this to <code>false</code> will break some Istio features, such as <code>ServiceEntries</code> and egress waypoints, but may be desirable for workloads that interact poorly with DNS proxies.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49829\">Issue #49829</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring the <code>istio.io/ingress-use-waypoint</code> label at the namespace level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support to preserve the original case of HTTP/1.x headers.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53680\">Issue #53680</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>Service.spec.trafficDistribution</code> field and <code>networking.istio.io/traffic-distribution</code> annotation, allowing a simpler mechanism to make traffic prefer geographically close endpoints.\nNote: this feature previously existed only for ztunnel, but is now supported across all data planes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug with mixed cased Hosts in Gateway and TLS redirect which resulted in stale RDS.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49638\">Issue #49638</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where an <code>HTTPRoute</code> in a <code>VirtualService</code> with a matcher specifying <code>sourceLabels</code> would be applied to a waypoint.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51565\">Issue #51565</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where if a WASM image fetch fails, an allow all RBAC filter is used. Now if <code>failStrategy</code> is set to <code>FAIL_CLOSE</code>, a DENY-ALL RBAC filter will be used.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53279\">Issue #53279</a>),(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/23624\">Issue #23624</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> waypoint proxy to respect trust domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where merging <code>Duration</code> in an <code>EnvoyFilter</code> could lead to all listeners associated attributes unexpectedly being modified because all listeners shared the same pointer type (<code>listener_filters_timeout</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where errors were being raised during cleanup of iptables rules that were conditional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a configuration issue so that DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where istiod did not handle <code>RequestAuthentication</code> correctly for cross-namespace waypoint proxies.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54051\">Issue #54051</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue that caused patches to a managed gateway/waypoint deployment to fail during upgrade to 1.24.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54145\">Issue #54145</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where non-default revisions controlling gateways lacked <code>istio.io/rev</code> labels.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54280\">Issue #54280</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the wording of the status message when L7 rules are present in an <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code> which is bound to ztunnel to be more clear.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54334\">Issue #54334</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where request mirror filter incorrectly computed the percentage.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54357\">Issue #54357</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where using a tag in the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label on a gateway causes the gateway to be improperly programmed and to lack status.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54458\">Issue #54458</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where out-of-order ztunnel disconnects could put <code>istio-cni</code> in a state where it believes it has no connections.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54544\">Issue #54544</a>),(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53843\">Issue #53843</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> excessive iptables info-level log entries for rule checks and deletions.\nDetailed logging can be re-enabled by switching to debug-level logs, if necessary.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54644\">Issue #54644</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue that caused <code>ExternalName</code> services to fail to resolve when using ambient mode and DNS proxying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing configuration to be rejected when there is a partial overlap between IP addresses across multiple services.\nFor example, a Service with <code>[IP-A]</code> and one with <code>[IP-B, IP-A]</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52847\">Issue #52847</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing <code>VirtualService</code> header name validation to reject valid header names.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue when upgrading waypoint proxies from Istio 1.23.x to Istio 1.24.x.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53883\">Issue #53883</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the <code>DAC_OVERRIDE</code> capability to the <code>istio-cni-node</code> <code>DaemonSet</code>. This fixes issues when running in environments\nwhere certain files are owned by non-root users.\nNote: prior to Istio 1.24, the <code>istio-cni-node</code> ran as <code>privileged</code>. Istio 1.24 removed this, but removed some required\nprivileges which are now added back. Relatively to Istio 1.23, <code>istio-cni-node</code> still has fewer privileges than it does with this change.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> unconfined AppArmor annotation to the <code>istio-cni-node</code> <code>DaemonSet</code> to avoid conflicts with\nAppArmor profiles which block certain privileged pod capabilities. Previously, AppArmor\n(when enabled) was bypassed for the <code>istio-cni-node</code> <code>DaemonSet</code> since privileged was set to true\nin the <code>SecurityContext</code>. This change ensures that the AppArmor profile is set to unconfined\nfor the <code>istio-cni-node</code> <code>DaemonSet</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ambient <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policies were overly strict.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53884\">Issue #53884</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a possible race conditions in JWK resolution cache for JWT policies that, when triggered, would cause\ncache misses &amp; failures to update signing keys when rotated.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52121\">Issue #52121</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in ambient (only) where multiple <code>STRICT</code> port-level mTLS rules in a <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policy would effectively result\nin a permissive policy due to incorrect evaluation logic (<code>AND</code> vs. <code>OR</code>).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54146\">Issue #54146</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient destinations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for additional label exchange for telemetry in sidecar mode.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54000\">Issue #54000</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new <code>service.istio.io/workload-name</code> label that can be added to a <code>Pod</code> or <code>WorkloadEntry</code> to override the &ldquo;workload name&rdquo; reported in telemetry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a fallback to use the <code>WorkloadGroup</code> name as the &ldquo;workload name&rdquo; (as reported in telemetry) for <code>WorkloadEntry</code>s created by a <code>WorkloadGroup</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> <code>$(HOST_IP)</code> interpolation causes istio-proxy failures when Datadog tracing enabled on IPv6 clusters.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54267\">Issue #54267</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access log order instability caused connection draining.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54672\">Issue #54672</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where many panels in the Grafana dashboards showed <strong>No data</strong> if Prometheus had a scrape\ninterval configured to be larger than <code>15s</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2020/09/28/new-in-grafana-7.2-__rate_interval-for-prometheus-rate-queries-that-just-work/\">Background information</a> and <a href=\"https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/using-istio-dashboard/\">usage</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> OpenCensus support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> Both <code>platform</code> and <code>profile</code> Helm values overrides now equivalently support global or local override forms, e.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--set global.platform=foo</code></li>\n<li><code>--set global.profile=bar</code></li>\n<li><code>--set platform=foo</code></li>\n<li><code>--set profile=bar</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the ztunnel Helm chart to set resource names to <code>.Release.Name</code> instead of being hard-coded to ztunnel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> new messages to the <code>WaypointBound</code> condition to represent a service binding to a waypoint proxy for ingress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl install</code> not working on Windows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a pod <code>dnsPolicy</code> of <code>ClusterFirstWithHostNet</code> to <code>istio-cni</code> when it runs with <code>hostNetwork=true</code> (i.e. ambient mode).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> GKE platform profile for ambient mode. When installing on GKE, use <code>--set global.platform=gke</code> (Helm) or <code>--set values.global.platform=gke</code> (istioctl) to apply GKE-specific value overrides. This replaces the previous GKE auto detection based on K8S version used in the <code>istio-cni</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for Envoy config parameter to skip deprecated logs, with the default set to true. Setting the <code>ENVOY_SKIP_DEPRECATED_LOGS</code> environment variable to false will enable deprecated logs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> ambient dataplane exclusion labels to Istio-shipped gateways by default, to avoid out-of-the-box confusing behavior if installing gateways outside of <code>istio-system</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54824\">Issue #54824</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>ipset</code> entry creation would fail on certain kinds of Docker-based Kubernetes nodes.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53512\">Issue #53512</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> Helm render to properly apply annotations on pilot <code>serviceAccount</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51289\">Issue #51289</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a issue where <code>includeInboundPorts: &quot;&quot;</code> not working when <code>istio-cni</code> is enabled.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54288\">Issue #54288</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI installation left temporary files when a container was repeatedly killed during the binary copy, which could have filled the storage space.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54311\">Issue #54311</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the gateway chart where <code>--set platform</code> worked but <code>--set global.platform</code> did not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where  <code>gateway</code> injection template did not respect the <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-logs-container</code>\nand <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container</code> annotations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the <code>istio-iptables</code> command to fail when a non-built-in table is present in the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue preventing the <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code> <code>maxUnavailable</code> field from being customizable.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54087\">Issue #54087</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where injection configuration errors were being silenced (i.e. logged and not returned) when the sidecar injector was unable to process the sidecar config.

bug with mixed-case Hosts in Gateway and TLS redirect resulted in stale RDS.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49638\">Issue #49638</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Ambient <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policies were overly strict.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53884\">Issue #53884</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> failure to patch managed gateway/waypoint deployments during upgrade to 1.24.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54145\">Issue #54145</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in where multiple STRICT port-level mTLS rules in an ambient mode PeerAuthentication policy would effectively result\nin a permissive policy due to incorrect evaluation logic (AND vs. OR).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54146\">Issue #54146</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the wording of the status message when L7 rules are present in an AuthorizationPolicy which is bound to ztunnel, to be clearer.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54334\">Issue #54334</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the request mirror filter incorrectly computed the percentage.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54357\">Issue #54357</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where using a tag in the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label on a gateway caused the gateway to be improperly programmed, and to lack status.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54458\">Issue #54458</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where out-of-order ztunnel disconnects could put <code>istio-cni</code> in a state where it believes it has no connections.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54544\">Issue #54544</a>),(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53843\">Issue #53843</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access log order caused instability during connection draining.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54672\">Issue #54672</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the gateway chart where <code>--set platform</code> worked but <code>--set global.platform</code> did not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient mode destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the <code>istio-iptables</code> command to fail when a non-built-in table is present in the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing configuration to be rejected when there is a partial overlap between IP addresses across multiple services.\nFor example, a Service with <code>[IP-A]</code> and one with <code>[IP-B, IP-A]</code>.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52847\">Issue #52847</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-early-days\">The early days<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-early-days\" name=\"the-early-days\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yace-gains-momentum\">Yace Gains Momentum<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#yace-gains-momentum\" name=\"yace-gains-momentum\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\">Gratitude and Future Vision<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#gratitude-and-future-vision\" name=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"try-out-yace-on-your-own\">Try out YACE on your own<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#try-out-yace-on-your-own\" name=\"try-out-yace-on-your-own\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

Prometheus 3.0 aims to \ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-new\">What's New<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-new\" name=\"whats-new\"></a>\n</h1>\n<div class=\"toc toc-right\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\">New UI\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\">OTLP Support\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\">Native Histograms\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes\n</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-ui\">New UI<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\" name=\"new-ui\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please \n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\" name=\"remote-write-2-0\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. \nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\" name=\"utf-8-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"otlp-support\">OTLP Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\" name=\"otlp-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features \nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\" name=\"otlp-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\" name=\"utf-8-normalization\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:%7E:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"native-histograms\">Native Histograms<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\" name=\"native-histograms\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\" name=\"breaking-changes\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"performance\">Performance<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#performance\" name=\"performance\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a> \nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-next\">What's Next<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-next\" name=\"whats-next\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and… \nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong>\n</li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"try-it-out\">Try It Out!<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#try-it-out\" name=\"try-it-out\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"looking-back-at-2023\">Looking back at 2023<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#looking-back-at-2023\" name=\"looking-back-at-2023\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-year-ahead\">The year ahead<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-year-ahead\" name=\"the-year-ahead\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\">OTLP Ingestion GA<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion-ga\" name=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\">Support UTF-8 metric and label names<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\" name=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\">Native support for resource attributes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-support-for-resource-attributes\" name=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\">OTLP export in the ecosystem<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\" name=\"otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"delta-temporality\">Delta temporality<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#delta-temporality\" name=\"delta-temporality\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"call-for-contributions\">Call for contributions!<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#call-for-contributions\" name=\"call-for-contributions\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute.

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\">History of the Forwarding Use Case<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\" name=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (: </p>\n\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"remote-write\">Remote Write<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write\" name=\"remote-write\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"prometheus-agent-mode\">Prometheus Agent Mode<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#prometheus-agent-mode\" name=\"prometheus-agent-mode\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\">The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\" name=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\">Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\" name=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\">How to Use Agent Mode in Detail<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\" name=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">usage: prometheus [&lt;flags&gt;]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#summary\" name=\"summary\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"preamble\">Preamble<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#preamble\" name=\"preamble\"></a>\n</h1>\n<div class=\"toc toc-right\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-categories\">New Categories\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#call-for-action\">Call for Action\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#register-for-being-tested\">Register for being tested\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#full-prometheus-compatibility\">Full Prometheus Compatibility\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#projects\">Projects\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#aas\">aaS\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#agent-collector\">Agent/Collector\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#passing\">Passing\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#not-passing\">Not passing\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</ul></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-categories\">New Categories<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-categories\" name=\"new-categories\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"call-for-action\">Call for Action<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#call-for-action\" name=\"call-for-action\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"register-for-being-tested\">Register for being tested<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#register-for-being-tested\" name=\"register-for-being-tested\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"test-results\">Test results<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#test-results\" name=\"test-results\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"full-prometheus-compatibility\">Full Prometheus Compatibility<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#full-prometheus-compatibility\" name=\"full-prometheus-compatibility\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"projects\">Projects<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#projects\" name=\"projects\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"passing\">Passing<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#passing\" name=\"passing\"></a>\n</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"not-passing\">Not passing<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#not-passing\" name=\"not-passing\"></a>\n</h4>\n\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>.

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This release fixes a lot of issues that have been present since the release of v2.0.0. v2.0.0 has been gaining adoption slowly and it has only been recently that users have been reporting some of the issues related with dual-stack configurations.</p>\n<p>The big additions for this release include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing broken compatibility with iptables-legacy systems experienced with the upstream kube-router container since version v2.1.0 (which is when Alpine 3.19 was introduced). There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
