Traditional full backup approaches face challenges with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Long backup windows</em>: Full volume backups can take hours for large datasets, making it difficult\nto complete within maintenance windows.</li>\n<li><em>High resource utilization</em>: Backup operations consume substantial network bandwidth and I/O\nresources, especially for large data volumes and data-intensive applications.</li>\n<li><em>Increased storage costs</em>: Repetitive full backups store redundant data, causing storage\nrequirements to grow linearly even when only a small percentage of data actually changes between\nbackups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Changed Block Tracking API addresses these challenges by providing native Kubernetes support for\nincremental backup capabilities through the CSI interface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-components\">Key components</h2>\n<p>The implementation consists of three primary components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>CSI SnapshotMetadata Service API</em>: An API, offered by gRPC, that provides volume\nsnapshot and changed block data.</li>\n<li><em>SnapshotMetadataService API</em>: A Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that\nadvertises CSI driver metadata service availability and connection details to\ncluster clients.</li>\n<li><em>External Snapshot Metadata Sidecar</em>: An intermediary component that connects CSI\ndrivers to backup applications via a standardized gRPC interface.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"implementation-requirements\">Implementation requirements</h2>\n<h3 id=\"storage-provider-responsibilities\">Storage provider responsibilities</h3>\n<p>If you're an author of a storage integration with Kubernetes and want to support the changed block tracking feature, you must implement specific requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Implement CSI RPCs</em>: Storage providers need to implement the <code>SnapshotMetadata</code> service as defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/csi.proto\">CSI specifications protobuf</a>. This service requires server-side streaming implementations for the following RPCs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GetMetadataAllocated</code>: For identifying allocated blocks in a snapshot</li>\n<li><code>GetMetadataDelta</code>: For determining changed blocks between two snapshots</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Storage backend capabilities</em>: Ensure the storage backend has the capability to track and report block-level changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Deploy external components</em>: Integrate with the <code>external-snapshot-metadata</code> sidecar to expose the snapshot metadata service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Register custom resource</em>: Register the <code>SnapshotMetadataService</code> resource using a CustomResourceDefinition and create a <code>SnapshotMetadataService</code> custom resource that advertises the availability of the metadata service and provides connection details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Support error handling</em>: Implement proper error handling for these RPCs according to the CSI specification requirements.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"backup-solution-responsibilities\">Backup solution responsibilities</h3>\n<p>A backup solution looking to leverage this feature must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Set up authentication</em>: The backup application must provide a Kubernetes ServiceAccount

      "summary": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes community, I am thrilled to announce that the Pod Level Resources feature has graduated to Beta in the Kubernetes v1.34 release and is enabled by default! This significant milestone introduces a new layer of flexibility for defining and managing resource allocation for your Pods. This flexibility stems from the ability to specify CPU and memory resources for the Pod as a whole. Pod level resources can be combined with the container-level specifications to express the exact resource requirements and limits your application needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pod-level-specification-for-resources\">Pod-level specification for resources</h2>\n<p>Until recently, resource specifications that applied to Pods were primarily defined\nat the individual container level. While effective, this approach sometimes required\nduplicating or meticulously calculating resource needs across multiple containers\nwithin a single Pod. As a beta feature, Kubernetes allows you to specify the CPU,\nmemory and hugepages resources at the Pod-level. This means you can now define\nresource requests and limits for an entire Pod, enabling easier resource sharing\nwithout requiring granular, per-container management of these resources where\nit's not needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-pod-level-specification-matter\">Why does Pod-level specification matter?</h2>\n<p>This feature enhances resource management in Kubernetes by offering <em>flexible resource management</em> at both the Pod and container levels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It provides a consolidated approach to resource declaration, reducing the need for\nmeticulous, per-container management, especially for Pods with multiple\ncontainers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources enable containers within a pod to share unused resoures\namongst themselves, promoting efficient utilization within the pod. For example,\nit prevents sidecar containers from becoming performance bottlenecks.

At runtime, the pod-level limit acts as a hard ceiling\nfor the combined resource usage of all containers.

      "summary": "<p>Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) is a Kubernetes API for managing scarce resources across Pods and containers.\nIt enables flexible resource requests, going beyond simply allocating <em>N</em> number of devices to support more granular usage scenarios.\nWith DRA, users can request specific types of devices based on their attributes, define custom configurations tailored to their workloads, and even share the same resource among multiple containers or Pods.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we focus on the device sharing feature and dive into a new capability introduced in Kubernetes 1.34: <em>DRA consumable capacity</em>,\nwhich extends DRA to support finer-grained device sharing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background-device-sharing-via-resourceclaims\">Background: device sharing via ResourceClaims</h2>\n<p>From the beginning, DRA introduced the ability for multiple Pods to share a device by referencing the same ResourceClaim.\nThis design decouples resource allocation from specific hardware, allowing for more dynamic and reusable provisioning of devices.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes 1.33, the new support for <em>partitionable devices</em> allowed resource drivers to advertise slices of a device that are available, rather than exposing the entire device as an all-or-nothing resource.\nThis enabled Kubernetes to model shareable hardware more accurately.</p>\n<p>But there was still a missing piece: it didn't yet support scenarios\nwhere the device driver manages fine-grained, dynamic portions of a device resource — like network bandwidth — based on user demand,\nor to share those resources independently of ResourceClaims, which are restricted by their spec and namespace.</p>\n<p>That’s where <em>consumable capacity</em> for DRA comes in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-dra-consumable-capacity-support\">Benefits of DRA consumable capacity support</h2>\n<p>Here's a taste of what you get in a cluster with the <code>DRAConsumableCapacity</code>\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> enabled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"device-sharing-across-multiple-resourceclaims-or-devicerequests\">Device sharing across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests</h3>\n<p>Resource drivers can now support sharing the same device — or even a slice of a device — across multiple ResourceClaims or across multiple DeviceRequests.</p>\n<p>This means that Pods from different namespaces can simultaneously share the same device,\nif permitted and supported by the specific DRA driver.</p>\n<h3 id=\"device-resource-allocation\">Device resource allocation</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes extends the allocation algorithm in the scheduler to support allocating a portion of a device's resources, as defined in the <code>capacity</code> field.\nThe scheduler ensures that the total allocated capacity across all consumers never exceeds the device’s total capacity, even when shared across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests.\nThis is very similar to the way the scheduler allows Pods and containers to share allocatable resources on Nodes;\nin this case, it allows them to share allocatable (consumable) resources on Devices.</p>\n<p>This feature expands support for scenarios where the device driver is able to manage resources <strong>within</strong> a device and on a per-process basis — for example,\nallocating a specific amount of memory (e.g., 8 GiB) from a virtual GPU,\nor setting bandwidth limits on virtual network interfaces allocated to specific Pods. This aims to provide safe and efficient resource sharing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"distinctattribute-constraint\">DistinctAttribute constraint</h3>\n<p>This feature also introduces a new constraint: <code>DistinctAttribute</code>, which is the complement of the existing <code>MatchAttribute</code> constraint.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of <code>DistinctAttribute</code> is to prevent the same underlying device from being allocated multiple times within a single ResourceClaim, which could happen since we are allocating shares (or subsets) of devices.\nThis constraint ensures that each allocation refers to a distinct resource, even if they belong to the same device class.</p>\n<p>It is useful for use cases such as allocating network devices connecting to different subnets to expand coverage or provide redundancy across failure domains.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-consumable-capacity\">How to use consumable capacity?</h2>\n<p><code>DRAConsumableCapacity</code> is introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.34.

      "summary": "<p>The rise of AI/ML and other high-performance workloads has made specialized hardware like GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs a critical component of many Kubernetes clusters. However, as discussed in a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/\">previous blog post about navigating failures in Pods with devices</a>, when this hardware fails, it can be difficult to diagnose, leading to significant downtime. With the release of Kubernetes v1.34, we are excited to announce a new alpha feature that brings much-needed visibility into the health of these devices.</p>\n<p>This work extends the functionality of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4680-add-resource-health-to-pod-status\">KEP-4680</a>, which first introduced a mechanism for reporting the health of devices managed by Device Plugins. Now, this capability is being extended to <em>Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)</em>. Controlled by the <code>ResourceHealthStatus</code> feature gate, this enhancement allows DRA drivers to report device health directly into a Pod's <code>.status</code> field, providing crucial insights for operators and developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-expose-device-health-in-pod-status\">Why expose device health in Pod status?</h2>\n<p>For stateful applications or long-running jobs, a device failure can be disruptive and costly. By exposing device health in the <code>.status</code> field for a Pod, Kubernetes provides a standardized way for users and automation tools to quickly diagnose issues. If a Pod is failing, you can now check its status to see if an unhealthy device is the root cause, saving valuable time that might otherwise be spent debugging application code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>This feature introduces a new, optional communication channel between the Kubelet and DRA drivers, built on three core components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-new-grpc-health-service\">A new gRPC health service</h3>\n<p>A new gRPC service, <code>DRAResourceHealth</code>, is defined in the <code>dra-health/v1alpha1</code> API group. DRA drivers can implement this service to stream device health updates to the Kubelet. The service includes a <code>NodeWatchResources</code> server-streaming RPC that sends the health status (<code>Healthy</code>, <code>Unhealthy</code>, or <code>Unknown</code>) for the devices it manages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kubelet-integration\">Kubelet integration</h3>\n<p>The Kubelet’s <code>DRAPluginManager</code> discovers which drivers implement the health service. For each compatible driver, it starts a long-lived <code>NodeWatchResources</code> stream to receive health updates. The DRA Manager then consumes these updates and stores them in a persistent <code>healthInfoCache</code> that can survive Kubelet restarts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"populating-the-pod-status\">Populating the Pod status</h3>\n<p>When a device's health changes, the DRA manager identifies all Pods affected by the change and triggers a Pod status update. A new field, <code>allocatedResourcesStatus</code>, is now part of the <code>v1.ContainerStatus</code> API object. The Kubelet populates this field with the current health of each device allocated to the container.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-practical-example\">A practical example</h2>\n<p>If a Pod is in a <code>CrashLoopBackOff</code> state, you can use <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;</code> to inspect its status. If an allocated device has failed, the output will now include the <code>allocatedResourcesStatus</code> field, clearly indicating the problem:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">status</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">containerStatuses</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>my-gpu-intensive-container<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># ... other container statuses</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">allocatedResourcesStatus</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"claim:my-gpu-claim\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resources</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">resourceID</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"example.com/gpu-a1b2-c3d4\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">health</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"Unhealthy\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This explicit status makes it clear that the issue is with the underlying hardware, not the application.</p>\n<p>Now you can improve the failure detection logic to react on the unhealthy devices associated with the Pod by de-scheduling a Pod.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-this-feature\">How to use this feature</h2>\n<p>As this is an alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.34, you must take the following steps to use it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable the <code>ResourceHealthStatus</code> feature gate on your kube-apiserver and kubelets.</li>\n<li>Ensure you are using a DRA driver that implements the <code>v1alpha1 DRAResourceHealth</code> gRPC service.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"dra-drivers\">DRA drivers</h2>\n<p>If you are developing a DRA driver, make sure to think about device failure detection strategy and ensure that your driver is integrated with this feature. This way, your driver will improve the user experience and simplify debuggability of hardware issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>This is the first step in a broader effort to improve how Kubernetes handles device failures. As we gather feedback on this alpha feature, the community is planning several key enhancements before graduating to Beta:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Detailed health messages:</em> To improve the troubleshooting experience, we plan to add a human-readable message field to the gRPC API. This will allow DRA drivers to provide specific context for a health status, such as &quot;GPU temperature exceeds threshold&quot; or &quot;NVLink connection lost&quot;.</li>\n<li><em>Configurable health timeouts:</em> The timeout for marking a device's health as &quot;Unknown&quot; is currently hardcoded. We plan to make this configurable, likely on a per-driver basis, to better accommodate the different health-reporting characteristics of various hardware.</li>\n<li><em>Improved post-mortem troubleshooting:</em> We will address a known limitation where health updates may not be applied to pods that have already terminated. This fix will ensure that the health status of a device at the time of failure is preserved, which is crucial for troubleshooting batch jobs and other &quot;run-to-completion&quot; workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature was developed as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4680-add-resource-health-to-pod-status\">KEP-4680</a>, and community feedback is crucial as we work toward graduating it to Beta. We have more improvements of device failure handling in k8s and encourage you to try it out and share your experiences with the SIG Node community!</p>",

This marks a significant milestone in enhancing the accuracy of stateful pod scheduling by reducing failures due to outdated attachable volume capacity information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/introduction.html\">CSI drivers</a> report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node's lifecycle for various reasons, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manual or external operations attaching/detaching volumes outside of Kubernetes control.</li>\n<li>Dynamically attached network interfaces or specialized hardware (GPUs, NICs, etc.) consuming available slots.</li>\n<li>Multi-driver scenarios, where one CSI driver’s operations affect available capacity reported by another.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don't, leading to pods stuck in a <code>ContainerCreating</code> state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dynamically-adapting-csi-volume-limits\">Dynamically adapting CSI volume limits</h2>\n<p>With this new feature, Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler, as well as other components relying on this information, have the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Periodic Updates:</strong> CSI drivers specify an interval to periodically refresh the node's allocatable capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>Reactive Updates:</strong> An immediate update triggered when a volume attachment fails due to exhausted resources (<code>ResourceExhausted</code> error).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"enabling-the-feature\">Enabling the feature</h3>\n<p>To use this beta feature, the <code>MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount</code> feature gate must be enabled in these components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>kube-apiserver</code></li>\n<li><code>kubelet</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example-csi-driver-configuration\">Example CSI driver configuration</h3>\n<p>Below is an example of configuring a CSI driver to enable periodic updates every 60 seconds:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nkind: CSIDriver\nmetadata:\nname: example.csi.k8s.io\nspec:\nnodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds: 60\n</code></pre><p>This configuration directs kubelet to periodically call the CSI driver's <code>NodeGetInfo</code> method every 60 seconds, updating the node’s allocatable volume count. Kubernetes enforces a minimum update interval of 10 seconds to balance accuracy and resource usage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"immediate-updates-on-attachment-failures\">Immediate updates on attachment failures</h3>\n<p>When a volume attachment operation fails due to a <code>ResourceExhausted</code> error (gRPC code <code>8</code>), Kubernetes immediately updates the allocatable count instead of waiting for the next periodic update. The Kubelet then marks the affected pods as Failed, enabling their controllers to recreate them. This prevents pods from getting permanently stuck in the <code>ContainerCreating</code> state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>To enable this feature in your Kubernetes v1.34 cluster:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable the feature gate <code>MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount</code> on the <code>kube-apiserver</code> and <code>kubelet</code> components.</li>\n<li>Update your CSI driver configuration by setting <code>nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds</code>.</li>\n<li>Monitor and observe improvements in scheduling accuracy and pod placement reliability.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next steps</h2>\n<p>This feature is currently in beta and the Kubernetes community welcomes your feedback.

      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes typically uses ConfigMaps and Secrets to set environment variables,\nwhich introduces additional API calls and complexity,\nFor example, you need to separately manage the Pods of your workloads\nand their configurations, while ensuring orderly\nupdates for both the configurations and the workload Pods.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you might be using a vendor-supplied container\nthat requires environment variables (such as a license key or a one-time token),\nbut you don’t want to hard-code them or mount volumes just to get the job done.</p>\n<p>If that's the situation you are in, you now have a new (alpha) way to\nachieve that. Provided you have the <code>EnvFiles</code>\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a>\nenabled across your cluster, you can tell the kubelet to load a container's\nenvironment variables from a volume (the volume must be part of the Pod that\nthe container belongs to).\nthis feature gate allows you to load environment variables directly from a file in an emptyDir volume\nwithout actually mounting that file into the container.\nIt’s a simple yet elegant solution to some surprisingly common problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-this-all-about\">What’s this all about?</h2>\n<p>At its core, this feature allows you to point your container to a file,\none generated by an <code>initContainer</code>,\nand have Kubernetes parse that file to set your environment variables.\nThe file lives in an <code>emptyDir</code> volume (a temporary storage space that lasts as long as the pod does),\nYour main container doesn’t need to mount the volume.\nThe kubelet will read the file and inject these variables when the container starts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How It Works</h2>\n<p>Here's a simple example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Other volume types aren't supported for this feature.\nAt least one init container must mount that <code>emptyDir</code> volume (to write the file),\nbut the main container doesn’t need to—it just gets the variables handed to it at startup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-word-on-security\">A word on security</h2>\n<p>While this feature supports handling sensitive data such as keys or tokens,\nnote that its implementation relies on <code>emptyDir</code> volumes mounted into pod.\nOperators with node filesystem access could therefore\neasily retrieve this sensitive data through pod directory paths.</p>\n<p>If storing sensitive data like keys or tokens using this feature,\nensure your cluster security policies effectively protect nodes\nagainst unauthorized access to prevent exposure of confidential information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>This feature will eliminate a number of complex workarounds used today, simplifying\napps authoring, and opening doors for more use cases. Kubernetes stays flexible and\nopen for feedback. Tell us how you use this feature or what is missing.</p>",

      "published": "2025-10-02T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Embedded developers know this cycle well: write code, wait days or weeks to test on a hardware test bench, discover bugs, fix them, then wait again. Virtual testing environments promise faster feedback, but most implementations create new problems such as environment sprawl and escalating costs.</p>\n<p>GitLab's managed lifecycle environments solve these virtual testing challenges. Through virtual environment automation, GitLab accelerates embedded development cycles without the configuration complexity and cost overruns.</p>\n<h2>Virtual testing challenges</h2>\n<p>Virtual testing environments — simulated hardware setups that replicate embedded system behavior and real-world conditions — offer the potential to reduce hardware bottlenecks. Teams can test firmware on simulated processors, run model-in-the-loop (MIL) tests in MATLAB/Simulink, or verify software on virtual embedded systems without waiting for physical hardware access.</p>\n<p>However, teams often implement virtual environments using one of two common approaches, both of which create unsustainable challenges.</p>\n<h3>Flawed approach 1: Pipeline lifecycle environments</h3>\n<p><strong>Pipeline lifecycle environments re-create the entire testing setup for every CI/CD run.</strong> When code changes trigger your CI/CD pipeline, the system provisions infrastructure, installs software simulations, and configures everything from scratch before running tests.</p>\n<p>This approach works for simple scenarios but becomes inefficient as complexity rises. Consider software-in-the-loop (SIL) testing in a complex virtual environment, for example. Each pipeline run requires complete environment re-creation, including virtual processor provisioning, toolchain installations, and target configurations. <strong>These processes can eat up considerable time.</strong></p>\n<p>Moreover, as embedded systems require more sophisticated virtual hardware configurations, the provisioning <strong>costs quickly add up.</strong></p>\n<p>To avoid these rebuild costs and delays, many teams turn to long-lived environments that persist between test runs. But they come with downsides.</p>\n<h3>Flawed approach 2: Long-lived environments</h3>\n<p><strong>Long-lived environments persist indefinitely</strong> to avoid constant rebuilding. Developers request these environments from IT or DevOps teams, wait for approval, then need someone to manually provision the infrastructure. These environments are then tied to individual developers/teams rather than specific code changes, and they support ongoing development work across multiple projects.</p>\n<p>While this eliminates rebuild overhead, <strong>it creates environment sprawl.</strong> Environments accumulate without a clear termination date. Infrastructure costs climb as environments consume resources indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Long-lived environments also suffer from <strong>&quot;config rot&quot;</strong> — environments retain settings, cached data, or software versions from previous tests that can affect subsequent results. A test that should fail ends up passing due to the residue of previous testing.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, managing long-lived environments is a manual process that slows development velocity and increases operational overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>GitLab offers a third approach</strong> through “managed lifecycle environments.” This approach captures the benefits of both long-lived and pipeline lifecycle environments while avoiding the drawbacks.</p>\n<h2>Solution: Managed lifecycle environments</h2>\n<p>GitLab's managed lifecycle environments tie virtual testing setups to merge requests (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/\">MRs</a>) rather than pipeline runs or individual developers. You can also think of them as “managed MR test environments.” When you create an MR for a new feature, GitLab automatically orchestrates the provisioning of necessary virtual testing environments. These environments persist throughout the entire feature development process.</p>\n<h3>Key benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Persistent environments without rebuilding:</strong> The same virtual environment handles multiple pipeline runs as you iterate on your feature. Whether you're running MIL tests in MATLAB/Simulink or SIL tests on specialized embedded processors, the environment remains configured and ready.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automatic cleanup:</strong> When you merge your feature and delete the branch, GitLab automatically triggers environment cleanup, eliminating environment sprawl.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single source of truth:</strong> The MR records all build results, test outcomes, and environment metadata in one location. Team members can track progress and collaborate without shuffling between different tools or spreadsheets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch this overview video to see how managed lifecycle environments work in practice:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tfyVPK5DuI?si=Kj_xXNo02bnFBDhy&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>GitLab automates the entire testing workflow. Each time you run firmware tests, GitLab orchestrates testing in the appropriate virtual environment, records results, and provides full visibility into every pipeline run. This approach transforms complex virtual testing from a manual, error-prone process into automated, reliable workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>The result:</strong> Teams get reusable environments without runaway costs. And they increase efficiency while maintaining clean, isolated testing setups for each feature.</p>\n<p>See a demonstration of managed lifecycle environments for testing firmware on virtual hardware:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWdY-kTlpH4?si=D6rpoulr9sv6Sl6E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<h2>Business impact</h2>\n<p>GitLab's managed lifecycle environments deliver measurable improvements across embedded development workflows. Teams running MIL testing in MATLAB/Simulink and SIL testing on specialized processors like Infineon AURIX or BlackBerry QNX systems no longer face the tradeoff between constant environment rebuilds or uncontrolled environment sprawl. Instead, these complex virtual testing setups persist throughout feature development while automatically cleaning up when complete, enabling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster product development cycles</li>\n<li>Shorter time-to-market</li>\n<li>Lower infrastructure costs</li>\n<li>Higher quality assurance</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Start transforming virtual testing today</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.gitlab.com/embedded-en/whitepaper-unlocking-agility-embedded-development\"><strong>Download “Unlocking agility and avoiding runaway costs in embedded development”</strong></a> for a deeper exploration of managed lifecycle environments and learn how to accelerate embedded development workflows dramatically.</p>",

But on its own, it’s limited to\ntrained data or public sources, while developers often need access to\ninternal systems like project trackers, dashboards, databases, design files\nin Figma, or documents in Google Drive.</p>\n<p>Now integrated into <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-3-expanding-ai-orchestration-in-software-engineering/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a>, the Model Context Protocol (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ai/model-context-protocol/\">MCP</a>) gives AI secure access to internal tools so developers can get comprehensive assistance directly within their workflows.</p>\n<h2>What is MCP?</h2>\n<p>MCP, first introduced by Anthropic in 2024, is an open standard that connects AI with data and tools. It works as a secure two-way channel: MCP clients (AI applications, autonomous agents, or development tools) request data or actions, and MCP servers provide trusted, authorized responses from their connected data sources.</p>\n<p>MCP servers act as secure bridges to various systems: They can connect to databases, APIs, file systems, cloud services, or any external tool to retrieve and provide data. This enables AI tools and agents to go beyond their initial training data by allowing them to access real-time information and execute actions, such as rescheduling meetings or checking calendar availability, while maintaining strict security, privacy, and audit controls.</p>\n<h2>Why AI use MCP instead of APIs?</h2>\n<p>You may ask: Why use MCP if AI can already call system APIs directly? The challenge is that each API has its own authentication, data formats, and behaviors, which would require AI to use custom connectors for every system and continuously maintain them as APIs evolve, making direct integrations complex and error-prone. MCP addresses this by providing a standardized, secure interface that handles authentication, permissions, and data translation. This enables AI tools to connect reliably to any system, while simplifying integration and ensuring consistent, safe behavior.</p>\n<h2>GitLab's MCP support</h2>\n<p>GitLab extends <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-chat-gets-agentic-ai-makeover/\">Duo Agentic Chat</a> with MCP support, shattering the barriers that previously isolated AI from the tools developers use every day. This empowers developers to access their entire toolkit directly from their favorite IDE, in natural language, enabling GitLab Duo Agent Platform to deliver comprehensive assistance without breaking developer flow or forcing disruptive context switches.</p>\n<p>GitLab provides comprehensive MCP support through two complementary workflows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_clients/\">MCP client workflow</a>:</strong> Duo Agent Platform serves as an MCP client, allowing features to access various external tools and services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_server/\">MCP server workflow</a>:</strong> GitLab also provides MCP server capabilities, enabling AI tools and applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools to connect securely to your GitLab instance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Interactive walkthrough demo of the MCP client workflow</h2>\n<p><strong>Picture this common Monday morning scenario:</strong> Your company's checkout service is throwing timeout errors. Customers can't complete purchases, and you need to investigate fast. Normally, you'd open Jira to review the incident ticket, scroll through Slack for updates, and check Grafana dashboards for error spikes. With GitLab's MCP support, you can do all of this in natural language directly from the chat in your IDE. MCP correlates data across all your systems, giving you the full picture instantly, without leaving your development workflow.</p>\n<p>To experience this capability firsthand, we've created an <a href=\"https://gitlab.navattic.com/mcp\">interactive walkthrough</a> illustrating the payment service scenario above.

The steps include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Turn on Feature preview</strong> — In your Group settings, navigate to <strong>GitLab Duo</strong> in the left sidebar, then check the box for &quot;Turn on experiment and beta GitLab Duo features&quot; under the <strong>Feature preview</strong> section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Turn on MCP for your group</strong> — Enable MCP support in your GitLab group settings to allow Duo features to connect to external systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Set up MCP servers</strong> — Define the MCP servers in JSON format in the <code>mcp.json</code> file. Create the file in this location:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows:</strong> <code>C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\GitLab\\duo\\mcp.json</code></li>\n<li><strong>All other operating systems:</strong> <code>~/.gitlab/duo/mcp.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For workspace-specific configurations, see <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_clients/#create-workspace-configuration\">workspace configuration setup</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\n{\n  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {\n    &quot;server-name&quot;: {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;,\n      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;path/to/server&quot;,\n      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;--arg1&quot;, &quot;value1&quot;],\n      &quot;env&quot;: {\n        &quot;ENV_VAR&quot;: &quot;value&quot;\n      }\n    },\n    &quot;http-server&quot;: {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;http&quot;,\n      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000/mcp&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;sse-server&quot;: {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sse&quot;,\n      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000/mcp/sse&quot;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Install and configure your IDE — Ensure VSCodium or Visual Studio Code is installed along with the GitLab Workflow extension (Version 6.28.2 or later for basic MCP support, 6.35.6 or later for full support).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For full step-by-step instructions, configuration examples, and troubleshooting tips, see the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_clients/\">GitLab MCP clients documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Example project</h2>\n<p>To complement the walkthrough, we are sharing the project that served as its <strong>foundation</strong>. This project allows you to reproduce the same flow in your own environment and explore GitLab's MCP capabilities hands-on.</p>\n<p>It demonstrates MCP functionality in a simulated enterprise setup, using mock data from Jira, Slack, and Grafana to model an incident response scenario. The included <code>mcp.json</code> configuration shows how to connect to a local MCP server (<code>enterprise-data-v2</code>) or optionally extend the setup with AWS services for cloud integration.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\n{\n  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {\n    &quot;enterprise-data-v2&quot;: {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;, \n      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;node&quot;,\n      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;src/server.js&quot;],\n      &quot;cwd&quot;: &quot;/path/to/your/project&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;aws-knowledge&quot;: {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;\n      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;,\n      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;mcp-remote&quot;, &quot;https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws&quot;]\n    },\n    &quot;aws-console&quot;: {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;stdio&quot;\n      &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx&quot;, \n      &quot;args&quot;: [&quot;@imazhar101/mcp-aws-server&quot;],\n      &quot;env&quot;: {\n        &quot;AWS_REGION&quot;: &quot;YOUR_REGION&quot;,\n        &quot;AWS_PROFILE&quot;: &quot;default&quot;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security note:</strong> The <code>aws-console</code> uses a community-developed MCP server package (<code>@imazhar101/mcp-aws-server</code>) for AWS integration that has not been independently verified.\nThis is intended for demonstration and learning purposes only. For production use, evaluate packages thoroughly or use official alternatives.</p>\n<p>Additionally, configure AWS credentials using AWS CLI profiles or IAM roles rather than hardcoding them in the configuration file. The AWS SDK will automatically discover credentials from your environment, which is the recommended approach for enterprise governance and security compliance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To get started, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/mcp/gitlab-duo-mcp-demo.git\">clone the project</a>, install dependencies with <code>npm install</code>, then start the local MCP server with <code>npm start</code>. Create an <code>~/.gitlab/duo/mcp.json</code> file with the configuration above, update the file path to match your local setup, and restart VS Code to load the MCP configuration. Optionally, add your AWS credentials to experience live cloud integration.</p>\n<p>Clone the project here: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/mcp/gitlab-duo-mcp-demo.git\">GitLab Duo MCP Demo</a>.</p>\n<h2>Example prompts to try with the demo project</h2>\n<p>Once you've configured the example project, you can start exploring your data and tools directly from GitLab Duo Agentic Chat in your IDE.

We have shipped new solutions to our customers every month for 150+ months, and that tradition will continue.</p>\n<p>As we lead the industry, we remain committed to helping our customers translate these new capabilities into business value.</p>\n<p>We firmly believe that, in this era of accelerating AI-powered innovation across the technology ecosystem, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/why-are-organizations-moving-to-a-unified-devsecops-platform/\">a unified platform approach</a> to tackle our customers’ toughest engineering challenges has never been more important than today. This approach enables organizations to reduce integration overhead, close security gaps, and adopt innovation without disrupting existing software delivery workflows.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerate releases with agentic AI:</strong> Fragmented toolchains slow down code reviews and testing. GitLab Duo agents and flows automate tasks like code reviews, test generation, and vulnerability triage in the context of the full platform, helping teams shorten cycle times and improve quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Build securely from the start:</strong> Many organizations treat security as an afterthought, leading to costly rework and compliance gaps. GitLab embeds scanning, policy enforcement, and compliance checks into everyday workflows, catching risks earlier without slowing developers down.</li>\n<li><strong>Deploy with flexibility:</strong> Teams with strict regulatory or operational constraints need deployment options beyond multi-tenant SaaS. GitLab supports SaaS, self-managed, air-gapped, and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2025-05-19-gitlab-announces-gitlab-achieves-fedramp-moderate-authorization/\">FedRAMP Moderate Authorized</a> environments, ensuring customers maintain control where competitors cannot.</li>\n<li><strong>Deliver consistent innovation:</strong> Tool fragmentation makes adopting new features risky and disruptive. GitLab’s monthly releases deliver new capabilities, such as <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a>, expanded AI governance, and cloud integrations that teams can adopt without retooling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Customer use cases that matter most</h2>\n<p>Together with the Magic Quadrant, we think the 2025 Gartner Critical Capabilities for DevOps Platforms report evaluates how well platforms serve real-world customer scenarios. GitLab ranked 1st in 4 out of 6 use cases.</p>\n<p>GitLab supports the following areas of innovation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/platform/\"><strong>Integrated toolset</strong></a> for cloud-native delivery and enterprise scale</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/agile-delivery/\"><strong>Advanced planning tools</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/application-security-testing/\"><strong>extensive security features</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/package/\"><strong>Package management</strong></a> and feature flags for progressive delivery</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/analytics-and-insights/\"><strong>Value stream metrics</strong></a> for visibility and improvement across the lifecycle</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\"><strong>AI-native workflows</strong></a>, embedded directly into daily tasks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This versatility translates into real customer value, as Bal Kang, Engineering Platform Lead at NatWest, explains:</p>\n<p><em>“Having GitLab Duo AI agents embedded in our system of record for code, tests, CI/CD, and the entire software development lifecycle boosts productivity, velocity, and efficiency. The agents understand intent, break down problems, and take action — becoming true collaborators to our teams.”</em></p>\n<p>The shift toward unified platforms represents a fundamental change in how organizations approach software development.

Every team has ‘their way' of doing things. So creating a custom agent is just like training a fellow engineer on the ‘right way' to do things in your organization.</p>\n<p>For example, a custom Product Planning agent can file bugs in the specific format, following your labeling standards, or a Technical Writer agent can draft concise documentation following your conventions, or a Security agent can make sure your security and compliance standards are met for every MR. Instead of functioning as disconnected tools, these agents become part of the natural stream of work inside GitLab — helping accelerate tasks without disrupting established processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This capability is currently only available on GitLab.com as an Experiment. We plan to deliver this to our self-managed customers next month in the 18.5 release.</p>\n<h2>Stay in your flow</h2>\n<p><em>GitLab Duo Agentic Chat makes collaboration with agents seamless.</em></p>\n<h3>Smarter Agentic Chat to streamline collaboration with agents (Beta)</h3>\n<p>As the centerpiece of GitLab Duo Agent Platform (Beta), <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\">Agentic Chat</a> gives you a seamless way to collaborate with AI agents. The latest update to Agentic Chat with GitLab 18.4 improves the chat experience and expands how sessions are managed and surfaced.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Chat with custom agent</strong></p>\n<p>Let's start with your newly-created custom agent. Once designed, you can immediately put that agent to work through Agentic Chat. For example, you could ask your new agent “give me a list of assignments” to get started with your priorities for the day. Additionally, you now have the ability to start fresh conversations with new agents and resume previous conversations with agents without losing context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_selection/#select-a-model-to-use-in-gitlab-duo-agentic-chat\"><strong>User model selection</strong></a></p>\n<p>With previous releases, you're able to select models at a namespace level, but in 18.4 you can now choose models at the user level for a given chat session.

With Knowledge Graph, you can give your agents more context so they can reason faster and give you better results.</em></p>\n<h3>Introducing the GitLab Knowledge Graph (Beta)</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/rust/knowledge-graph/\">GitLab Knowledge Graph</a> in 18.4 transforms how developers and agents understand and navigate complex codebases. The Knowledge Graph provides a connected map of your entire project, linking files, routes, and references across the software development lifecycle. By leveraging tools such as go-to-definition, codebase search, and reference tracking through in-chat queries, developers gain the ability to ask precise questions like “show me all route files” or “what else does this change impact?”\nThis deeper context helps teams move faster and with more confidence — whether it's onboarding new contributors, conducting deep research across a project, or exploring how a modification impacts dependent code. The more of your ecosystem that lives in GitLab, the more powerful the Knowledge Graph becomes, giving both humans and AI agents the foundation to build with accuracy, speed, and full project awareness. In future releases, we'll be stitching all of your GitLab data into the Knowledge Graph, including plans, MRs, security vulnerabilities, and more.\nThis release of the Knowledge Graph focuses on local code indexing, where the <code>gkg</code> CLI turns your codebase into a live, embeddable graph database for RAG. You can install it with a simple one-line script, parse local repositories, and connect via MCP to query your workspace.\nOur vision for the Knowledge Graph project is twofold: building a vibrant community edition that developers can run locally today, which will serve as the foundation for a future, fully-integrated Knowledge Graph Service within GitLab.com and self-managed instances.\n&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1121017374?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;18.4 Knowledge Graph Demo&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>Automate your pipeline maintenance</h2>\n<p><em>Fix pipeline failures faster and stay in the flow with the Fixed Failed Pipelines Flow.</em></p>\n<h3>Fix Failed Pipelines Flow with business awareness</h3>\n<p>Keeping pipelines green is critical for your development velocity, but traditional approaches focus only on technical troubleshooting without considering the business impact. The <strong>Fix Failed Pipelines Flow</strong> addresses this challenge by combining technical analysis with strategic context. For example, it can automatically prioritize fixing a failed deployment pipeline for a customer-facing service ahead of a nightly test job, or flag build issues in a high-priority release branch differently than experimental feature branches.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Business-aware failure detection</strong> monitors pipeline executions while understanding the importance of different workflows and deployment targets.</li>\n<li><strong>Contextual root cause analysis</strong> analyzes failure logs alongside business requirements, recent changes, and cross-project dependencies to identify underlying causes.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic fix prioritization</strong> generates appropriate fixes while considering business impact, deadlines, and resource allocation priorities.</li>\n<li><strong>Workflow-integrated resolution</strong> automatically creates merge requests with fixes that maintain proper review processes while providing business context for prioritization decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This flow keeps pipelines green while maintaining strategic alignment, enabling automated fixes to support business objectives rather than just resolving technical issues in isolation.</p>\n<h2>Customize your AI environment</h2>\n<p><em>Automation only works if you trust the models behind it. That's why 18.4 delivers governance features like model selection and GitLab-managed keys.</em></p>\n<h3>GitLab Duo model selection to optimize feature performance</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_selection/\">Model selection</a> is now generally available, giving you direct control over which large language models (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-is-a-large-language-model-llm/\">LLMs</a>) power GitLab Duo. You and your team can select the models of your choice, apply them across the organization or tailor them per feature. You can set defaults to ensure consistency across namespaces and tools, with governance, compliance, and security requirements in mind.</p>\n<p>For customers using GitLab Duo Self-Hosted, newly added support for GPT OSS and GPT-5 provides additional flexibility for AI-powered development workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> GitLab Duo Self-Hosted is not available to GitLab.com customers, and GPT models are not supported on GitLab.com.</p>\n<h2>Protect your sensitive context</h2>\n<p><em>Alongside governance comes data protection, giving you fine-grained control over what AI can and can't see.</em></p>\n<h3>GitLab Duo Context Exclusion for granular data protection</h3>\n<p>It's no surprise — you need granular control over what information AI agents can access. <strong>GitLab Duo Context Exclusion</strong> in 18.4 provides project-level settings that let teams exclude specific files or file paths from AI access. Capabilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>File-specific exclusions</strong> to help protect sensitive files such as password configurations, secrets, and proprietary algorithms.</li>\n<li><strong>Path-based rules</strong> to create exclusion patterns based on directory structures or file naming conventions.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible configuration</strong> to apply exclusions at the project level while maintaining development workflow efficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Audit visibility</strong> to track what content is excluded to support compliance with data governance policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab Duo Context Exclusion helps you protect sensitive data while you accelerate development with agentic AI.</p>\n<h2>Extend your AI capabilities with new MCP tools</h2>\n<p><em>Expanded MCP tools extend those capabilities even further, connecting your GitLab environment with a broader ecosystem of intelligent agents.</em></p>\n<h3>New tools for GitLab MCP server</h3>\n<p>Expanding on the initial MCP server introduced in <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-3-expanding-ai-orchestration-in-software-engineering/\">18.3</a>, GitLab 18.4 adds more MCP tools — capabilities that define how MCP clients interact with GitLab. These new tools extend integration possibilities, enabling both first-party and third-party AI agents to take on richer tasks such as accessing project data, performing code operations, or searching across repositories, all while respecting existing security and permissions models. For a full list of MCP tools, including the new additions in 18.4, visit our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_server/\">MCP server documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Experience the future of intelligent software development</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a>, engineers can begin to move from working on one issue at a time in single threaded fashion, to multi-threaded collaboration with asynchronous agents that act like teammates to get work done, faster. We are bringing to market this unique vision with our customer's preferences for independence and choice: run in your preferred cloud environments using the LLMs and AI tools that work best for you, within the security and compliance guardrails you set.</p>\n<p>As an integral part of this innovation, GitLab 18.4 is more than a software upgrade — it's about making the day-to-day experience of developers smoother, smarter, and more secure.

      "summary": "<p>Modern businesses entirely depend on web-based platforms for customer interactions, financial\ntransactions, data processing, and core business operations. As digital transformation\naccelerates and remote or hybrid work becomes the norm, the attack surface for web applications has\nexpanded dramatically, making them prime targets for cybercriminals. Therefore, securing web applications has become more critical than ever.</p>\n<p>While static code analysis catches vulnerabilities in source code, it cannot identify\nruntime security issues that emerge when applications interact with real-world\nenvironments, third-party services, and complex user workflows. This is where Dynamic\nApplication Security Testing (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dast/\">DAST</a>) becomes invaluable. GitLab's integrated DAST solution provides teams with automated security testing capabilities directly within their CI/CD pipelines, on a schedule, or on-demand, enabling continuous security validation\nwithout disrupting development workflows.</p>\n<h2>Why DAST?</h2>\n<p>DAST should be implemented because it provides critical runtime security validation by testing applications\nin their actual operating environment, identifying vulnerabilities that static analysis cannot detect.\nAdditionally, GitLab DAST can be seamlessly integrated into shift-left security workflows, and\ncan enhance compliance assurance along with risk management.</p>\n<h3>Runtime vulnerability detection</h3>\n<p>DAST excels at identifying security vulnerabilities that only manifest when applications are running.\nUnlike static analysis tools that examine code at rest, DAST scanners interact with live applications\nas an external attacker would, uncovering issues such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Authentication and session management flaws</strong> that could allow unauthorized access</li>\n<li><strong>Input validation vulnerabilities,</strong> including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection</li>\n<li><strong>Configuration weaknesses</strong> in web servers, databases, and application frameworks</li>\n<li><strong>Business logic flaws</strong> that emerge from complex user interactions</li>\n<li><strong>API security issues,</strong> including improper authentication, authorization, and data exposure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DAST complements other security testing approaches to provide comprehensive application security coverage. When combined with Static Application Security Testing (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/\">SAST</a>), Software Composition Analysis (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/\">SCA</a>), manual\npenetration testing, and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/application-security-testing/\">many other scanner types</a>, DAST fills critical gaps in security validation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black-box testing perspective</strong> that mimics real-world attack scenarios</li>\n<li><strong>Environment-specific testing</strong> that validates security in actual deployment configurations</li>\n<li><strong>Third-party component testing,</strong> including APIs, libraries, and external services</li>\n<li><strong>Configuration validation</strong> across the entire application stack</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Seamless shift-left security integration</h3>\n<p>GitLab DAST seamlessly integrates into existing CI/CD pipelines, enabling teams to identify security\nissues early in the development lifecycle. This shift-left approach provides several key benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cost reduction</strong> — Fixing vulnerabilities during development is significantly less expensive than addressing them in production. Studies show that remediation costs can be 10 to 100 times higher in production environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster time-to-market</strong> — Automated security testing eliminates bottlenecks caused by manual security reviews, allowing teams to maintain rapid deployment schedules while ensuring security standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Developer empowerment</strong> — By providing immediate feedback on security issues, DAST helps developers build security awareness and improve their coding practices over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compliance and risk management</h3>\n<p>Many regulatory frameworks and industry standards require regular security testing of web applications.\nDAST helps organizations meet compliance requirements for standards such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PCI DSS</strong> for applications handling payment card data</li>\n<li><strong>SOC 2</strong> security controls for service organizations</li>\n<li><strong>ISO 27001</strong> information security management requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The automated nature of GitLab DAST ensures consistent, repeatable security testing that auditors can\nrely on, while detailed reporting provides the documentation needed for compliance validation.</p>\n<h2>Implementing DAST</h2>\n<p>Before implementing GitLab DAST, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GitLab version and Ultimate subscription</strong> — DAST is available in <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/ultimate/\">GitLab Ultimate</a> and requires GitLab 13.4 or later for full functionality; however, the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/\">latest version</a> is recommended.</li>\n<li><strong>Application accessibility</strong> — Your application must be accessible via HTTP/HTTPS with a publicly reachable URL or accessible within your GitLab Runner's network.</li>\n<li><strong>Authentication setup</strong> — If your application requires authentication, prepare test credentials or configure authentication bypass mechanisms for security testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Basic implementation</h3>\n<p>The simplest way to add DAST to your pipeline is by including the DAST template in your <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/#step-1-create-a-gitlab-ciyml-file\"><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code></a> file\nand providing a website to scan:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">include:\n  - template: DAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n\nvariables:\n  DAST_WEBSITE: &quot;https://your-application.example.com&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This basic configuration will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run a DAST scan against your specified website</li>\n<li>Generate a security report in GitLab's security dashboard</li>\n<li>Fail the pipeline if high-severity vulnerabilities are detected</li>\n<li>Store scan results as pipeline artifacts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, it is suggested to gain the full benefit of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/\">CI/CD</a>, you can first deploy the application\nand set DAST to run only after an application has been deployed. The application URL can be\ndynamically created and the DAST job can be configured fully with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/\">GitLab Job syntax</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">stages:\n  - build\n  - deploy\n  - dast\n\ninclude:\n  - template: Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n# Builds and pushes application to GitLab's built-in container registry\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  variables:\n    IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG:$CI_COMMIT_SHA\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $IMAGE .\n    - docker push $IMAGE\n\n# Deploys application to your suggested target, setsup the dast site dynamically, requires build to complete\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;DAST_WEBSITE=http://your-application.example.com&quot; &gt;&gt; deploy.env\n    - echo &quot;Perform deployment here&quot;\n  environment:\n    name: $DEPLOY_NAME\n    url: http://your-application.example.com\n  artifacts:\n    reports:\n      dotenv: deploy.env\n  dependencies:\n    - build\n\n# Configures DAST to run a an active scan on non-main branches, and a passive scan on the main branches and requires a deployment to complete before it is run\ndast:\n  stage: dast\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH\n      variables:\n        DAST_FULL_SCAN: &quot;false&quot;\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME != $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH\n      variables:\n        DAST_FULL_SCAN: &quot;true&quot;\n  dependencies:\n    - deploy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can learn from an example by seeing the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/tutorials/security-and-governance/tanuki-shop\">Tanuki Shop</a> demo application, which generates the\nfollowing pipeline:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Standard DAST Pipeline\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118303/rr3cyxjwyecxbmrdxon6.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Understanding passive vs. active scans</h3>\n<p>In the example above we enabled active scanning for non-default branches:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">- if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME != $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH\n  variables:\n    DAST_FULL_SCAN: &quot;true&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>GitLab DAST employs two distinct scanning methodologies (passive and active), each serving\ndifferent security testing needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive scans</strong> analyze application responses without sending potentially harmful requests. This approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examines HTTP headers, cookies, and response content for security misconfigurations</li>\n<li>Identifies information disclosure vulnerabilities like exposed server versions or stack traces</li>\n<li>Detects missing security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-options)</li>\n<li>Analyzes SSL/TLS configuration and certificate issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Active scans</strong> send crafted requests designed to trigger vulnerabilities. This approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tests for injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)</li>\n<li>Attempts to exploit authentication and authorization flaws</li>\n<li>Validates input sanitization and output encoding</li>\n<li>Tests for business logic vulnerabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The DAST scanner is set to passive by default.</p>\n<p>DAST has several configuration options that can be applied via environment variables.\nFor a list of all the possible configuration options for DAST, see the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dast/browser/configuration/customize_settings/\">DAST documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Authentication configuration</h3>\n<p>DAST requires authentication configuration in CI/CD jobs to achieve complete security coverage. Authentication enables DAST to simulate real attacks and test user-specific features only accessible after login. The DAST job typically authenticates by submitting login forms in a browser, then verifies success before continuing to crawl the application with saved credentials. Failed authentication stops the job.</p>\n<p>Supported authentication methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single-step login form</li>\n<li>Multi-step login form</li>\n<li>Authentication to URLs outside the target scope</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example for a single-step login form in a <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/tutorials/security-and-governance/tanuki-shop/-/merge_requests/20\">Tanuki Shop MR</a> which adds\nadmin authentication to non-default branches.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">dast:\n  stage: dast\n  before_script:\n    - echo &quot;DAST_TARGET_URL set to '$DAST_TARGET_URL'&quot; # Dynamically loaded from deploy job\n    - echo &quot;DAST_AUTH_URL set to '$DAST_TARGET_URL'&quot; # Dynamically loaded from deploy jobs\n  rules:\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH\n      variables:\n        DAST_FULL_SCAN: &quot;false&quot;\n    - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME != $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH\n      variables:\n        DAST_FULL_SCAN: &quot;true&quot; # run both passive and active checks\n        DAST_AUTH_USERNAME: &quot;admin@tanuki.local&quot; # The username to authenticate to in the website\n        DAST_AUTH_PASSWORD: &quot;admin123&quot; # The password to authenticate to in the website\n        DAST_AUTH_USERNAME_FIELD: &quot;css:input[id=email]&quot; # A selector describing the element used to enter the username on the login form\n        DAST_AUTH_PASSWORD_FIELD: &quot;css:input[id=password]&quot; # A selector describing the element used to enter the password on the login form\n        DAST_AUTH_SUBMIT_FIELD: &quot;css:button[id=loginButton]&quot; # A selector describing the element clicked on to submit the login form\n        DAST_SCOPE_EXCLUDE_ELEMENTS: &quot;css:[id=navbarLogoutButton]&quot; # Comma-separated list of selectors that are ignored when scanning\n        DAST_AUTH_REPORT: &quot;true&quot; # generate a report detailing steps taken during the authentication process\n        DAST_REQUEST_COOKIES: &quot;welcomebanner_status:dismiss,cookieconsent_status:dismiss&quot; # A cookie name and value to be added to every request\n        DAST_CRAWL_GRAPH: &quot;true&quot; # generate an SVG graph of navigation paths visited during crawl phase of the scan\n  dependencies:\n    - deploy-kubernetes\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see if the authentication was successful by viewing the job logs:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Auth logs\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118293/zdxgwb6jmseyzwcjscrz.png\" /></p>\n<p>Once this job completes it provides an authentication report which includes screenshots of the login page:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Auth report\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118292/idm62deg3ezeehcubmc1.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can also see more examples on DAST with authentication in our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/demos/dast/\">DAST demos</a> group.\nTo learn more about how to perform DAST with authentication with your specific requirements, see the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dast/browser/configuration/authentication/\">DAST authentication documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Viewing results in MR</h2>\n<p>GitLab's DAST seamlessly integrates security scanning into your development workflow\nby displaying results directly within merge requests:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"DAST MR 1\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118293/rrx4n3pgxi9vmzlas8vp.png\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"DAST MR 2\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118294/rh9vwv6ohoaenpvicujm.png\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"DAST MR 3\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118294/ficelmulsc0r7bijf24m.png\" /></p>\n<p>These results include comprehensive vulnerability data within MRs to help developers identify and address\nsecurity issues before code is merged. Here's what DAST typically reports:</p>\n<h3>Vulnerability details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Vulnerability name and type (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)</li>\n<li>Severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)</li>\n<li>CVSS score when applicable</li>\n<li>Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier</li>\n<li>Confidence level of the finding</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Location information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>URL/endpoint where the vulnerability was detected</li>\n<li>HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.)</li>\n<li>Request/response details showing the vulnerable interaction</li>\n<li>Parameter names that are vulnerable</li>\n<li>Evidence demonstrating the vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Technical context</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Description of the vulnerability and potential impact</li>\n<li>Proof of concept showing how the vulnerability can be exploited</li>\n<li>Request/response pairs that triggered the finding</li>\n<li>Scanner details (which DAST tool detected it)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remediation guidance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Solution recommendations for fixing the vulnerability</li>\n<li>References to security standards (OWASP, etc.)</li>\n<li>Links to documentation for remediation steps</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Viewing results in GitLab Vulnerability Report</h2>\n<p>For managing vulnerabilities located in the default (or production) branch, the GitLab Vulnerability Report provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring all security findings (in the default branch) across your entire project or organization. This comprehensive view aggregates all security scan results, offering filtering and sorting capabilities to help security teams prioritize remediation efforts.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Vulnerability Report\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118304/o8jjgngtxqplcgux9h5p.png\" /></p>\n<p>When selecting a vulnerability, you are taken to its vulnerability page:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Vulnerability Page 1\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118303/rolcgxhe0lh2s54zz2kc.png\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"Vulnerability Page 2\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118303/dubic3yacd5n11ine1vi.png\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"Vulnerability Page 3\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118303/iojrm3zasqxljuybbqcs.png\" /></p>\n<p>Just like in merge requests, the vulnerability page provides comprehensive vulnerability data, as seen above. From here you can triage vulnerabilities by assigning them with a status:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Needs triage (Default)</li>\n<li>Confirmed</li>\n<li>Dismissed (Acceptable risk, False positive, Mitigating control, Used in tests, Not applicable)</li>\n<li>Resolved</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a vulnerability status is changed, the audit log includes a note of who changed it, when it was changed, and the reason it was changed. This comprehensive system allows security teams to efficiently prioritize, track, and manage vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle with clear accountability and detailed risk context.</p>\n<h2>On-demand and scheduled DAST</h2>\n<p>GitLab provides flexible scanning options beyond standard CI/CD pipeline integration through\non-demand and scheduled DAST scans. On-demand scans allow security teams and developers to\ninitiate DAST testing manually whenever needed, without waiting for code commits or pipeline triggers.\nThis capability is particularly valuable for ad-hoc security assessments, incident response scenarios,\nor when testing specific application features that may not be covered in regular pipeline scans.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"On-demand 1\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118296/hs3fhn42ceycmd94oaua.png\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"On-demand 2\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118298/wiptmr948xey6rrodosg.png\" /></p>\n<p>On-demand scans can be configured with custom parameters, target URLs, and scanning profiles, making\nthem ideal for focused security testing of particular application components or newly-deployed features.\nScheduled DAST scans provide automated, time-based security testing that operates independently of\nthe development workflow. These scans can be configured to run daily, weekly, or at custom intervals,\nensuring continuous security monitoring of production applications.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Scheduling DAST\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118300/dbxgkeahij4fklkpcpck.png\" /></p>\n<p>To learn how to implement on-demand or scheduled scans within your project, see the\n<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dast/on-demand_scan/\">DAST on-demand scan documentation</a></p>\n<h2>DAST in compliance workflows</h2>\n<p>GitLab's security policies framework allows organizations to enforce consistent security\nstandards across all projects, while maintaining flexibility for different teams and environments.\nSecurity policies enable centralized governance of DAST scanning requirements, ensuring that\ncritical applications receive appropriate security testing without requiring individual project\nconfiguration. By defining security policies at the group or instance level, security teams can\nmandate DAST scans for specific project types, deployment environments, or risk classifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Scan/Pipeline Execution Policies</strong> can be configured to automatically trigger DAST scans based on\nspecific conditions such as merge requests to protected branches, scheduled intervals, or deployment events.\nFor example, a policy might require full active DAST scans for all applications before production deployment,\nwhile allowing passive scans only for development branches. These policies can include custom variables,\nauthentication configurations, and exclusion rules that are automatically applied to all covered projects,\nreducing the burden on development teams and ensuring security compliance.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Scan Execution Policy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118299/twe0967sayasvassimf3.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Merge Request Approval Policies</strong> provide an additional layer of security governance by enforcing human\nreview for code changes that may impact security. These policies can be configured to require security team\napproval when DAST scans detect new vulnerabilities, when security findings exceed defined thresholds, or\nwhen changes affect security-critical components. For example, a policy might automatically require approval\nfrom a designated security engineer when DAST findings include high-severity vulnerabilities, while allowing\nlower-risk findings to proceed with standard code review processes.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"MR Approval Policy\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118295/w0odyhf3gnkxis3f61ma.png\" /></p>\n<p>To learn more about GitLab security policies, see the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/\">policy documentation</a>.\nAdditionally, for compliance, GitLab provides <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/security_inventory/\">Security Inventory</a>\nand <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_center/\">Compliance center</a>, which can allow you to oversee\nif DAST is running in your environment and where it is required.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Security Inventory\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758118300/hro6gykf7igpnnczmpyg.png\" /></p>\n<p>To learn more about these features, visit our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/software-compliance/\">software compliance solutions page</a>.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>GitLab DAST represents a powerful solution for integrating dynamic security testing into modern development workflows. By implementing DAST in your CI/CD pipeline, your team gains the ability to automatically detect runtime vulnerabilities, maintain compliance with security standards, and build more secure applications without sacrificing development velocity.</p>\n<p>The key to successful DAST implementation lies in starting with basic configuration and gradually expanding to more sophisticated scanning profiles as your security maturity grows. Begin with simple website scanning, then progressively add authentication, custom exclusions, and advanced reporting to match your specific security requirements.</p>\n<p>Remember that DAST is most effective when combined with other security testing approaches. Use it alongside static analysis, dependency scanning, and manual security reviews to create a comprehensive security testing strategy. The automated nature of GitLab DAST ensures that security testing becomes a consistent, repeatable part of your development process rather than an afterthought.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To learn more about GitLab security, check out our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/application-security-testing/\">security testing solutions page</a>.

      "summary": "<p>GitLab has been recognized for the second time as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants. We see this recognition as validation of a key pillar in our broader AI strategy, where intelligent code assistance evolves into comprehensive AI that transforms how entire teams plan, build, secure, and deploy software.\n<img alt=\"2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758121248/jfkmhddve6qvlg79xico.png\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gartner-mq-ai-code-assistants/\">Download the report.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>From AI features to intelligent collaboration</h2>\n<p>The Gartner evaluation, we feel, focused on GitLab Duo's generative AI code assistance capabilities. While GitLab Duo began as an AI add-on to the GitLab DevSecOps platform, it laid the groundwork for where we are going today with agentic AI built natively into the GitLab DevSecOps platform.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform enables developers to work alongside multiple AI agents that automate tasks across the software lifecycle. Agents collaborate with each other and with humans, using GitLab’s Knowledge Graph to act with full project context. This empowers teams to move faster while keeping visibility and control.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Specialized agents</strong> handle tasks such as code generation, security analysis, and research in parallel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Knowledge Graph</strong> connects agents to a unified system of record across code, issues, pipelines, and compliance data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Human + agent collaboration</strong> happens through natural-language chat and customizable flows, with review and oversight built in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interoperability with external tools and systems</strong> is supported through Model Context Protocol (MCP) and agent-to-agent frameworks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With agents handling routine work under human guidance, teams can move faster, focus on higher-value tasks, and keep projects secure and compliant.</p>\n<h2>Secure by design, flexible in practice</h2>\n<p>The GitLab Duo Agent Platform is designed to keep security and compliance front and center. Agents run inside GitLab’s trusted DevSecOps environment, with every action visible and reviewable before changes are made. Secure integrations help ensure credentials and sensitive data are handled safely, while interoperability through open standards connects agents to external tools without exposing an organization to risk.</p>\n<p>The platform gives teams confidence that AI is enhancing productivity without compromising governance. Here's how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developers</strong> can stay focused on complex, high-impact work, while handing off routine tasks to agents for faster results and more granular context delivered through their existing workflows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engineering leaders</strong> gain visibility into how work moves across the lifecycle, with agents operating within clear guardrails. They also can ensure their teams stay aligned to priorities and simplify onboarding with guided support through agent-driven context and workflows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>IT organizations</strong> maintain control over agent activity with governance features that enforce coding and security policies, offer model selection flexibility, and ensure secure interoperability — all while keeping humans in the loop.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Leading the move to AI-native development</h2>\n<p>GitLab continues to build on the vision that began with Duo, and will continue to expand GitLab Duo Agent Platform with new agents, advanced workflows, and more orchestration capabilities. This commitment to innovation ensures you can amplify team productivity on the platform you know and trust. Stay tuned for exciting updates on our roadmap as we continue to revolutionize AI-native DevSecOps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gartner-mq-ai-code-assistants/\">Download the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants</a> and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Source: Gartner, Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants, Philip Walsh, Haritha Khandabattu, Matt Brasier, Keith Holloway, Arun Batchu, 15 September 2025</em></p>\n<p><em>GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally, and MAGIC QUADRANT is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates and are used herein with permission.

      "summary": "<p>Creating dbt models manually is a tedious process that can consume hours of a data engineer's time. Especially when no (big) business transformations are made, it is not the most attractive part of an engineer's work with data.</p>\n<p>But what if you could automate this entire process? In this walkthrough, I'll show you exactly how <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a> can generate comprehensive dbt models in just minutes, complete with proper structure, tests, and documentation.</p>\n<h2>What we're building</h2>\n<p>Our marketing team wants to effectively manage and optimize advertising investments. One of the advertising platforms is Reddit, so, therefore, we are extracting data from the Reddit Ads API to our enterprise <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/\">Data Platform</a> Snowflake. At GitLab, we have three layers of storage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>raw</code> layer - first landing point for unprocessed data from external sources; not ready for business use</li>\n<li><code>prep</code> layer - first transformation layer with source models; still not ready for general business use</li>\n<li><code>prod</code> layer - final transformed data ready for business use and Tableau reporting</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Chart of storage layers\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1758030995/zo7vespktzfdtdtiauz7.png\" /></p>\n<p>For this walkthrough, data has already landed in the raw layer by our extraction solution Fivetran, and we'll generate dbt models that handle the data through the <code>prep</code> layer to the <code>prod</code> layer.</p>\n<p>Without having to write a single line of dbt code ourselves, by the end of the walkthrough we will have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source models</strong> in the prep layer</li>\n<li><strong>Workspace models</strong> in the prod layer</li>\n<li><strong>Complete dbt configurations</strong> for all 13 tables (which includes 112 columns) in the Reddit Ads dataset</li>\n<li><strong>Test queries</strong> to validate the outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The entire process will take less than 10 minutes, compared to the hours it would typically require manually. Here are the steps to follow:</p>\n<h2>1. Prepare the data structure</h2>\n<p>Before GitLab Duo can generate our models, it needs to understand the complete table structure. The key is running a query against Snowflake's information schema, because we are currently investigating how to connect GitLab Duo via Model Context Protocol (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ai/model-context-protocol/\">MCP</a>) to our Snowflake instance:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sql\">SELECT \n    table_name,\n    column_name,\n    data_type,\n    is_nullable,\n    CASE \n        WHEN is_nullable = 'NO' THEN 'PRIMARY_KEY'\n        ELSE NULL \n    END as key_type\nFROM raw.information_schema.columns\nWHERE table_schema = 'REDDIT_ADS'\nORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This query captures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All table and column names</li>\n<li>Data types for proper model structure</li>\n<li>Nullable constraints</li>\n<li>Primary key identification (non-nullable columns in this dataset)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> In the Reddit Ads dataset, all non-nullable columns serve as primary keys — a pattern. I validated by checking tables like <code>ad_group</code>, which has two non-nullable columns (<code>account_id</code> and <code>id</code>) that are both marked as primary keys. Running this query returned 112 rows of metadata that I exported as a CSV file for model generation. While this manual step works well today, we're investigating a direct GitLab Duo integration with our Data Platform via MCP to automate this process entirely.</p>\n<h2>2. Set up GitLab Duo</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to interact with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/get_started/getting_started_gitlab_duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Web UI chat function</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Visual Studio Code plugin</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I chose the VS Code plugin because I can run the dbt models locally to test them.</p>\n<h2>3. Enter the 'magic' prompt</h2>\n<p>Here's the exact prompt I used to generate all the dbt code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">Create dbt models for all the tables in the file structure.csv.\n\nI want to have the source models created, with a filter that dedupes the data based on the primary key. Create these in a new folder reddit_ads.\nI want to have workspace models created and store these in the workspace_marketing schema.\n\nTake this MR as example: [I've referenced to previous source implementation]. Here is the same done for Source A, but now it needs to be done for Reddit Ads. \n\nPlease check the dbt style guide when creating the code: https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/dbt-guide/\n</code></pre>\n<p>Key elements that made this prompt effective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear specifications</strong> for both source and workspace models.</li>\n<li><strong>Reference example</strong> from a previous similar merge request.</li>\n<li><strong>Style guide reference</strong> to ensure code quality and consistency.</li>\n<li><strong>Specific schema targeting</strong> for proper organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. GitLab Duo's process</h2>\n<p>After submitting the prompt, GitLab Duo got to work. The entire generation process took a few minutes, during which GitLab Duo:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Read and analyzed</strong> the CSV input file.</li>\n<li><strong>Examined table structures</strong> from the metadata.</li>\n<li><strong>Referenced our dbt style guide</strong> for coding standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Took similar merge request into account</strong> to properly structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Generated source models</strong> for all 13 tables.</li>\n<li><strong>Created workspace models</strong> for all 13 tables.</li>\n<li><strong>Generated supporting dbt files</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><code>sources.yml</code> configuration.</li>\n<li><code>schema.yml</code> files with tests and documentation.</li>\n<li>Updated <code>dbt_project.yml</code> with schema references.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The results</h2>\n<p>The output was remarkable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1 modified file:</strong> dbt_project.yml (added reddit_ads schema configuration)</li>\n<li><strong>29 new files:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>26 dbt models</strong> (13 source + 13 workspace)</li>\n<li><strong>3 YAML files</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Nearly 900 lines of code</strong> generated automatically</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in data tests,</strong> including unique constraints on primary key columns</li>\n<li><strong>Generic descriptions</strong> for all models and columns</li>\n<li><strong>Proper deduplication logic</strong> in source models</li>\n<li><strong>Clean, consistent code structure</strong> following the GitLab dbt style guide</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">transform/snowflake-dbt/\n├── dbt_project.yml                                                    [MODIFIED]\n└── models/\n    ├── sources/\n    │   └── reddit_ads/\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_ad_group_source.sql                        [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_ad_source.sql                              [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_business_account_source.sql                [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_campaign_source.sql                        [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_custom_audience_history_source.sql         [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_geolocation_source.sql                     [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_interest_source.sql                        [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_targeting_community_source.sql             [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_targeting_custom_audience_source.sql       [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_targeting_device_source.sql                [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_targeting_geolocation_source.sql           [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_targeting_interest_source.sql              [NEW]\n    │       ├── reddit_ads_time_zone_source.sql                       [NEW]\n    │       ├── schema.yml                                            [NEW]\n    │       └── sources.yml                                           [NEW]\n    └── workspaces/\n        └── workspace_marketing/\n            └── reddit_ads/\n                ├── schema.yml                                        [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_ad.sql                              [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_ad_group.sql                        [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_business_account.sql                [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_campaign.sql                        [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_custom_audience_history.sql         [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_geolocation.sql                     [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_interest.sql                        [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_targeting_community.sql             [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_targeting_custom_audience.sql       [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_targeting_device.sql                [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_targeting_geolocation.sql           [NEW]\n                ├── wk_reddit_ads_targeting_interest.sql              [NEW]\n                └── wk_reddit_ads_time_zone.sql                       [NEW]\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample generated code</h3>\n<p>Here's an example of the generated code quality.

CSV input files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> By connecting GitLab Duo via MCP to your (meta)data, you could exclude this manual step.</p>\n<h3>Provide clear context</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference existing example MRs when possible.</li>\n<li>Specify your coding standards and style guides.</li>\n<li>Be explicit about folder structure and naming conventions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Validate thoroughly</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Always create validation queries for data integrity.</li>\n<li>Test locally before merging.</li>\n<li>Run your CI/CD pipeline to catch any issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Leverage AI for follow-up tasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate test queries automatically.</li>\n<li>Create documentation templates.</li>\n<li>Build validation scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>This demonstration shows how AI-powered development tools like GitLab Duo are also transforming data engineering workflows. The ability to generate hundreds of lines of production-ready code in minutes —  complete with tests, documentation, and proper structure — represents a fundamental shift in how we approach repetitive development tasks.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI to handle the repetitive aspects of dbt model creation, data engineers can focus on higher-value activities like data modeling strategy, performance optimization, and business logic implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to try this yourself?</strong> Start with a small dataset, prepare your metadata carefully, and watch as GitLab Duo transforms hours of work into minutes of automated generation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">Trial GitLab Duo Agent Platform today.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Read more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-3-expanding-ai-orchestration-in-software-engineering/\">GitLab 18.3: Expanding AI orchestration in software engineering</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-public-beta/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform Public Beta: Next-gen AI orchestration and more</a></li>\n</ul>",

Effective Jan 1, 2026, our billing model will transition to a per-second basis for <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets\">Droplets</a>, with a minimum charge of 60 seconds. This new approach aims to optimize cost control by charging for exact usage over a minute, making it simple to get precise billing for your actual usage. For sustained workloads, the monthly cap of 672 hours (24 hours x 28 days) of usage remains in place, ensuring your bill never exceeds the predictable monthly price.</p>\n<p>Imagine your development team uses a CI/CD pipeline that uses $84/month CPU-Optimized Droplet to run automated tests taking 10 minutes. With hourly billing, each 10-minute task would charge you for the full hour, costing about $0.125. If you ran this job 20 times a day, your daily cost would have been around $2.50, even though the total active time was just over 3 hours. Now, with per-second billing, that same 10-minute task costs only about $0.02. By running the job 20 times a day, your total daily cost is just around $0.42.</p>\n<p>Per-second billing can provide a similarly dramatic cost reduction by ensuring you only pay for the precise compute time you use. Effective Jan 1, 2026, this change will apply automatically to all Droplets. Customers will be able to access detailed usage information, including Droplet start and end times, through their billing history and downloadable CSV reports.</p>\n<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CI/CD pipelines and automated testing:</strong> Only pay for the duration of testing jobs (minimum 60 seconds), not full hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Auto-scaled applications:</strong> Instances that briefly scale up will only be billed for active time (minimum 60 seconds), reducing costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Event-driven batch jobs:</strong> Intermittent, event-triggered tasks will be billed precisely for compute time (minimum 60 seconds), avoiding full-hour charges.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Granular cost control:</strong> Pay only for the seconds your Droplets are active, with a 60-second minimum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimized auto-scaling:</strong> Scale up and down to meet demand without incurring full hourly charges for brief usage, with a 60-second minimum per instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Budget predictability:</strong> Retain the monthly cap for continuous workloads.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get ready for this change, effective January 1, 2026: Read <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/details/pricing/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> to learn more and understand your current billing details in the <a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/billing?i=b1bbf4\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DigitalOcean console</a>.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"new-dedicated-droplet-plans-for-a-seamless-performance-upgrade\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#new-dedicated-droplet-plans-for-a-seamless-performance-upgrade\">New dedicated Droplet plans for a seamless performance upgrade</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#new-dedicated-droplet-plans-for-a-seamless-performance-upgrade\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Historically, upgrading from a shared CPU Droplet to a dedicated CPU Droplet for more consistent, sustained performance meant a large, costly leap in resources.

These approaches were operationally heavy, insecure, or costly. DigitalOcean’s new VPC NAT gateway available for public preview offers a fully managed, highly available, simple and scalable solution for SNAT and DNAT, designed to block external inbound connections and central egress traffic for consistent static IPs. NAT gateways preview is available for both Droplets and DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS). This enables pods and nodes within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to initiate outbound connections to the public internet using a single, shared public IP address, while keeping the IP addresses of internal resources private.</p>\n<p>Key features include easy setup, multiple NAT gateways per <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/vpc\">VPC</a> for specific Droplet egress, and predictable pricing at $40 per size 1 NAT gateway (including 100 GB bandwidth, $0.01/GB overage), making it significantly cheaper than some market alternatives.

With autoscaling, your database scales storage in lockstep with demand without manual intervention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preparing for volatile data such as log and event data growth: Apps that store logs, metrics, or IoT event data can balloon in size during an incident or audit period. Autoscaling means you can preserve all the data you need without scrambling for space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi-tenant growth within a SaaS company: In the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) industry, a single high-activity customer (or a rush of new sign-ups) can push your storage past its limit. Autoscaling makes that growth a non-event from an ops perspective.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Failproofing CI/CD test environments: Automated test runs often generate massive temporary datasets. Autoscaling helps ensure your test pipelines don’t fail mid-run due to full disks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Storage autoscaling provides a simple, yet powerful solution to a common problem. Now you can have confidence that your managed database can seamlessly handle data growth without manual intervention, allowing you to focus on what matters most: building an amazing application.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"get-started\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started\">Get started</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#get-started\"></a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new?activation_redirect=%2Fdatabases%2Fnew&amp;redirect_url=%2Fdatabases%2Fnew?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=autoscaling_for_storage\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spin up a database cluster to access Storage autoscaling</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/release-notes/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read our product documentation</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=autoscaling_for_storage\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Already have an account?

Every October, developers from all over the world come together to contribute their skills, big and small, to open-source projects.</p>\n<p>Code is the most common way people participate, but that’s not the only way you can help. Open source thrives on more than just commits. It needs documentation, testing, design, writing, and so much more.</p>\n<p>Before we get into the how, let’s cover the basics.</p>\n<p>First, the rules of Hacktoberfest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Register anytime before October 31.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Contribute to projects on GitHub or GitLab</strong> that have the <code>hacktoberfest</code> topic.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit at least 6 high-quality pull/merge requests</strong> between October 1 and October 31. These need to be accepted by project maintainers to count.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Everyone who signs up and gets at least one PR merged, gets a digital badge from Holopin (you can get up to 4 badges). If you’re among the first 10,000 people to complete 6 merged PRs/MRs, you’ll also get a limited edition Hactoberfest 2025 t-shirt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s it! You’re ready to dive in.</p>\n<p>Ways to contribute:</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-code-contributions\"><strong>1. Code Contributions</strong></h4>\n<p>This is what the majority of Hacktoberfest contributions consist of. Most participants jump in by submitting code to projects they care about. Maintainers, many of whom run projects purely out of passion, appreciate thoughtful, quality code more than anything.</p>\n<p>Whether this is your 12th Hacktoberfest or your very first pull request, now’s the time to fire up GitHub or GitLab and get started.</p>\n<p>Helpful resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source\">Introduction to GitHub and Open-Source Projects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/cheatsheets/how-to-use-git-a-reference-guide\">How to use Git</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.gitlab.com/nlPKcN\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">5 things for your first time contributing</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"2-maintaining-a-project\"><strong>2. Maintaining a project</strong></h4>\n<p>Hacktoberfest isn’t only for contributors. It’s for maintainers too. If you’ve got a project idea that could help the community, you can launch it now and take part as a maintainer.</p>\n<p>If you’re already maintaining an open-source project, here’s how to prepare it for Hacktoberfest contributions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the <code>hacktoberfest</code> topic to your repo.</li>\n<li>Label issues with <code>help wanted</code>, <code>good first issue</code>, and <code>hacktoberfest</code>.</li>\n<li>Keep issues well-scoped so new contributors don’t feel overwhelmed.</li>\n<li>Add a <a href=\"http://CONTRIBUTING.md\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></a> file with clear guidelines.</li>\n<li>Adopt a <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/pages/code-of-conduct\">code of conduct</a> to keep the community welcoming.</li>\n<li>Be ready to review contributions. Merge valid PRs/MRs, approve them, or mark them with <code>hacktoberfest-accepted</code>.</li>\n<li>Close spammy or invalid contributions with the <code>spam</code> or <code>invalid</code> labels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"3-low-and-no-code-contributions\"><strong>3. Low- and No-Code Contributions</strong></h4>\n<p>You don’t need to be a developer to participate. Open source projects need way more than code. Here are some impactful ways to contribute without writing a single line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve or write technical documentation.</li>\n<li>Help with user experience testing.</li>\n<li>Write tutorials, blog posts, or case studies.</li>\n<li>Share feedback on usability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Maintainers: if you want to accept these types of contributions, you may need to set up an activity log so participants can submit PRs/MRs that count toward Hacktoberfest.</p>\n<p>A note from MLH (Hacktoberfest sponsor)</p>\n<p>Hacktoberfest wouldn’t be possible without the open-source community or without sponsors like MLH. As Mike Swift from MLH put it:</p>\n<p>“The same way that hackathons are a dedicated space to work on personal projects, Hacktoberfest is an opportunity for all of us to get involved in the open source community. Whether you’re a first-time contributor or a long-term maintainer, by participating in Hacktoberfest you’re part of a worldwide movement to grow the open source ecosystem and train the next generation of open source citizens.”</p>\n<p>Get involved</p>\n<p>No matter how you participate, Hacktoberfest is about showing up with good energy, respecting maintainers, and making meaningful contributions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.com/register/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Registration is open!</a></p>\n<p>Bring your skills, your curiosity, and your open-source spirit. Let’s make Hacktoberfest 2025 a success together.</p>\n</details>",

Hacktoberfest is our month-long celebration of all things open source that kicks off on October 1. Each year, maintainers and contributors come together to contribute to the open-source projects that many individual maintainers, companies (including DigitalOcean), and builders of every skill level rely on. In the 12 years since its inception, Hacktoberfest has exploded from a group of just 676 contributors to a global open-source phenomenon, with over 90,000 participants last year across the globe. That’s a lot of love for open source!</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-participate-in-hacktoberfest-2025\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-to-participate-in-hacktoberfest-2025\">How to participate in Hacktoberfest 2025</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-to-participate-in-hacktoberfest-2025\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Hacktoberfest challenges you to support open-source projects by creating 6 pull or merge requests that project maintainers accept during October. We’re doing awards a little differently this year and bringing back t-shirts! If you’re among the first 10,000 contributors to complete 6 PRs, you will receive an official Hacktoberfest 2025 t-shirt and have a tree planted in your name.</p>\n<p>We’re also partnering with <a href=\"https://www.holopin.io/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Holopin</a> this year to share the open-source love digitally.

While it’s not the final release, this milestone gives us a sneak peek into what’s coming next for GitOps practitioners and platform teams.</p><p>This release candidate brings a collection of exciting new features along with critical bug fixes, and in this post, we’ll highlight the most important updates you should be aware of.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please note that Argo CD v2.x will not be supported once the Argo CD v3.2 release is released</p><h3>Health Checks Added for GitOps Promoter</h3><p>This PR introduces comprehensive health checks for GitOps Promoter resources, enabling enhanced monitoring and reliability for promotion workflows within Argo CD.</p><p>The new health checks cover various GitOps Promoter custom resource definitions, such as CommitStatus, PullRequest, PromotionStrategy, and ChangeTransferPolicy, providing detailed runtime status to help users better diagnose and maintain promotion pipelines.</p><p>Shoutout to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a> (Intuit) for this feature!</p><h3>New Deletion Strategy for Progressive Sync</h3><p>With Argo CD v3.2 RC, Progressive Sync now supports configurable deletion strategies for applications deployed by an ApplicationSet. Until now, deletions have always happened all at once, with every application removed in parallel and without any defined order. While this behavior remains the default, a new Reverse option has been introduced. When enabled, applications are deleted in the opposite order of their deployment, as defined in progressiveSync. This ensures that each application is fully removed before proceeding to the next, making it especially useful for workloads that depend on a specific teardown sequence.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’re deploying applications in a specific order using <strong>Progressive Sync</strong>. With the new deletionOrder field, you can now control how those applications are torn down.</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: ApplicationSet<br />metadata:<br />  name: sample-appset<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    type: RollingSync<br />    rollingSync:<br />      steps:<br />        - matchExpressions:<br />            - key: environment<br />              operator: In<br />              values: [ &quot;dev&quot; ]<br />        - matchExpressions:<br />            - key: environment<br />              operator: In<br />              values: [ &quot;staging&quot; ]<br />    deletionOrder: Reverse</pre><p>In this example, applications are deployed first to <em>dev</em> and then to <em>staging</em>. With deletionOrder: Reverse, Argo CD will delete <em>staging</em> before <em>dev</em>, ensuring a clean and safe teardown sequence that respects dependency order.

      "summary": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_-6V9xGQM6vGmsiD_dNEog.png\" /></figure><p>The results of the 2025 Argo CD user survey are in! We had a fantastic response, with 185 submissions, which shows the community is more engaged than ever.</p><p>This year, our goal was to capture a well-rounded view of how folks use Argo CD. We strive to stay closely connected to our users, understand where we’re excelling, and identify current pain points so we can prioritize improvements and proactively address community needs.</p><p>This year’s theme is environment promotion, as it has emerged as one of the most significant pain points currently experienced by Argo CD users.</p><p>Here’s what we learned.</p><h4>TL;DR</h4><p>Argo CD is growing fast and becoming a standard for deployments to production!</p><p>Compared to 2023, significantly more organizations rely on it in production. Over 60% of respondents have been actively using it in Production for more than 2 years. Patterns like ApplicationSets and self-healing have become widely adopted. Argo CD is increasingly being used at scale, with instances managing more applications, often spanning multiple clusters. We can expect scalability and performance to become the pressure points, as well as growing interest in enterprise-like capabilities from the community.</p><p>Environment promotion is where things start to get tricky. Most teams still lean on custom scripts or manual steps to get the job done. Many organizations seek solutions to improve traceability and visibility, and to standardize workflows across environments. We will likely see more maturity and new capabilities in this area.</p><p>We’re also seeing more applications under management overall, with organizations connecting more clusters to each Argo CD instance, yet still running just one to five instances. This trend points to growing pressure on instance scalability and performance.</p><p>A few more highlights from the results:</p><ul><li>Argo Labs projects like Argo CD Image Updater, Argo CD Operator, and Argo CD Vault Plugin are gaining traction, reflecting a push toward automation.</li><li>Helm is by far the most popular Argo CD installation method.</li><li>Platform engineers now make up a larger share of the community, reflecting broader organizational shifts.</li></ul><h4>What do developers really think of Argo CD?</h4><p>We kicked off the survey by asking users how likely they were to recommend Argo CD to others — one of the simplest ways to get a feel for overall satisfaction.</p><p>The 2025 result? Overwhelmingly positive 🎉 Even more users this year said they’d recommend Argo CD compared to an already strong showing in 2023. That shift says a lot about how far the tool has come and the growing trust the community has in it. In fact, Argo CD achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 79 — an increase of 3 points from two years ago — highlighting exceptional user satisfaction!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZY4tGNGXZGrHgLfn\" /></figure><p>We were overwhelmed by the encouraging and positive comments, reflecting just how much people love the project and deeply value the vibrant Argo community. Here’s what some users had to say:</p><blockquote><em>“Argo CD is incredible, I have no idea how we survived without it in the past.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Thanks for this great tool ❤️”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re awesome!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Please keep going!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Keep up the good work! :)”</em></blockquote><p>We asked which features users find most valuable. The winners?</p><ul><li>ApplicationSets</li><li>Argo CD’s intuitive UI</li></ul><p>Together, they make it much easier to manage and visualise complex deployments.</p><p>Also mentioned: auto-sync, drift detection, rollbacks, RBAC, multi-source support, and integrations.</p><h4>Who’s using Argo CD these days?</h4><p>The community remains consistent and is made up mostly of DevOps and platform engineers, but platform engineers have grown from 25% in 2023 to 37% in 2025. DevOps engineers declined slightly from 43% to 36%. This shift likely reflects the broader industry trend toward adopting a platform mindset, resulting in increased demand for dedicated platform engineering roles. Roles like architects and SREs remained steady.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZXUJ5osL9R28zoUn\" /></figure><h4>What does adoption look like in 2025?</h4><p>With the adoption being consistently high, 93% of respondents use Argo CD in production in 2023 and 97% in 2025, the implementation maturity grows significantly. In 2023, only 28% had used Argo CD in production for over 2 years. In 2025, that number jumped to 60%, and fewer than 10% were still evaluating or in early phases.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e0xsvHzotjrhkIYg\" /></figure><p>Almost 60% of respondents said that 75% or more of their production applications now run on Kubernetes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gWqJBdpN4BHjbFFs\" /></figure><p>As Kubernetes adoption deepens, Argo CD has become an essential part of the CI/CD infrastructure. As more organizations rely on Argo CD, we’ll likely see continued investment from both the community and vendors, as well as more contributors joining the project.</p><p>When it comes to Argo CD installation, Helm is by far the top choice, followed by tools like Kustomize and Terraform. Interesting to note: 19% use cluster-wide installs versus just 10% using namespace-scoped ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x4RJRiUclqZg-VgN\" /></figure><h4>What does the Argo CD footprint look like?</h4><p>The most noticeable trend is the growing number of applications. Organizations are managing bigger setups with fewer, larger instances.</p><p>In 2023, just over 15% managed more than 500 Applications; by 2025, this rose to 42%. Notably, these numbers don’t correlate with how long organizations have used Argo CD and how many applications they have.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eRwUqAp_3dbairfo\" /></figure><p>The number of Argo CD instances is growing compared to 2023, but the increase is not as significant as the rise in the number of applications. In 2023, 77% of respondents reported having fewer than 6 instances, while this percentage fell to 64% in 2025. Nevertheless, most organizations still use only a handful of instances.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q_ePbizmF7pE04-k\" /></figure><p>Even though the number of Argo CD instances hasn’t changed much, the number of applications certainly has! This means each instance is likely connecting to more clusters. For example, back in 2023, about 42% of instances were linked to one Kubernetes cluster. Fast forward to 2025, and that number has dropped to 25%. At the same time, the share of instances connecting to more than 20 clusters has jumped significantly, going from 5% to 25%.</p><p>In summary, organizations manage a significantly larger number of applications, with more clusters connected to a single Argo CD instance, typically keeping the number of instances between 1 and 5.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the community and the project? Well, it seems that managing lots of Argo CD instances might not be the biggest hurdle for most teams. Instead, the real pressure points are around scalability and performance as organizations push Argo CD to handle more clusters and Applications. Users are already calling out these challenges, and they’re likely to become even more important moving forward. The good news? Some of this work is already underway.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Interested in how to scale Argo CD? Take a look at the </em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-agent\"><em>argocd-agent project</em></a><em> or read an </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\"><em>article about scaling up Argo CD</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to contribute to measuring and improving Argo scalability, take a look at the Scalability special interest group (</em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/main/sigs/sig-scalability\"><em>Argo SIG Scalability</em></a><em>).</em></p><h4>What patterns and tools are catching on?</h4><p>More and more teams are following Argo CD’s recommended practices. App-of-Apps, ApplicationSets, and built-in self-healing are now widely used to manage complex GitOps setups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG5_7BB_xx5xn1U_\" /></figure><p>We also asked about sub-projects, an area that shows the ecosystem dynamics. The most used are:</p><ul><li>Argo CD Image Updater</li><li>Argo CD Operator</li><li>Argo CD Vault Plugin</li></ul><p>Like the patterns mentioned earlier, the popularity of these Argo Labs projects reflects growing efforts to make Argo CD implementations more structured and automation-friendly.</p><p><em>ℹ️ You can manage secrets with </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/secret-management/#secret-management\"><em>Kubernetes operators</em></a><em>, one of the recommended ways of managing secrets on the destination cluster. This keeps Argo CD out of direct secret management, helping avoid accidental updates and reducing the risk of leaks.</em></p><p>Image Updater is the most adopted sub-project (used by 34% of respondents). While still under active development and intended for non-critical environments, its popularity shows just how hungry teams are for better deployment and promotion automation.</p><p>But Image Updater only solves part of the deployment automation puzzle. There’s still no go-to comprehensive solution out there. We’ll explore this further in the next section on environment promotion.</p><h4>Environment promotion</h4><p>Given how widely Argo CD is used in production, we wanted to explore how teams handle environment promotion. Is it a pain point for GitOps users? And how do their approaches compare to the more traditional promotion strategies used on other platforms?</p><p>First, we looked at the number of environments teams work with. Now, most respondents use 3 or fewer. Only 12% reported having more than 8.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lwhiMHHc0r41nELe\" /></figure><p>This introduces complexity, as teams must coordinate across multiple instances. And that’s where challenges like consistent observability start to show up.</p><p>To dig deeper into this, we asked teams about their biggest pain points. What came up most?</p><ul><li>Traceability across environments, what version of a deployed app is running where (51%)</li><li>Release gates (44%)</li><li>Understanding app health and status across environments (37%)</li><li>Keeping pipeline definitions consistent (36%)</li><li>Troubleshooting failed promotions (29%)</li></ul><p>Most teams reported multiple challenges, with traceability and release gates often mentioned together.</p><p>To understand what drives these challenges, we asked how teams promote applications across environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IV4zO6ktxeE6AFz0\" /></figure><p>The most common setup is DIY. Around 67% use scripts, in-house tools, or both.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of teams handle promotions solely through manual manifest updates, and almost half use some form of manual step, often paired with scripts.</p><p>So, how can we make sense of this combination? One possibility is that teams are using Argo CD Image Updater, currently the most popular sub-project, for simple, image-only updates. For more complex tasks, like updating configuration files, many might rely on manual steps. In other words, automation helps with the easy stuff, but more involved changes still need hands-on work.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Manual manifest updates are often where teams start with Argo CD. They can work well for small setups, like a few static infrastructure manifests.</em></p><p><em>But as you scale, they tend to fall short. It’s easy to run into slower deployments, more manual overhead, and challenges around security and compliance. If you’re growing with Argo CD, it’s worth moving toward full CI/CD automation to keep things on track.</em></p><p>A few out-of-the-box solutions for automated environment promotion are starting to show up in the survey. The most mentioned, though still only used by 4% of respondents, is <a href=\"https://argo-gitops-promoter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">GitOps Promoter</a>. It’s part of the Argo CD ecosystem and works alongside <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/proposals/manifest-hydrator/\">Hydrator</a> to handle promotions via pull requests. Others mentioned Codefresh GitOps and Kargo.</p><p>Here’s how one person summed it up:</p><blockquote><em>“Some sort of environment promotion. Lots of players in the game now and it’s hard to settle on one. Lots of manual reviews required for manifest changes that can be tiresome to compare against other environments. Some sort of environment comparison tool would be good.”</em></blockquote><p>That quote really captures where things stand. Plenty is happening in this space, but no clear winner or standard approach just yet. As more teams adopt Argo CD and take on more advanced deployment setups, tackling challenges like traceability, testing, and consistent configuration will only become more important.</p><p>This is definitely a space to watch. Expect more tooling, more investment, and, hopefully, comprehensive user-friendly solutions soon.</p><h4>What challenges are teams facing?</h4><p>After digging into environment promotion, we zoomed out and asked about broader challenges, too.</p><p>Nearly 30% of respondents said they had no major challenges with Argo CD, which is a great sign.</p><p>The most common challenge, flagged by 37%, was environment modeling and promotion workflows (covered earlier).</p><p>Other pain points included:</p><ul><li>Troubleshooting deployments and app issues (25%)</li><li>Too much manual work or not enough automation (23%)</li><li>Limited visibility into deployment status (16%)</li></ul><h4>What features are missing?</h4><p>To wrap up, we asked what users think is missing from Argo CD. Many of the responses built on earlier themes.</p><p>Some areas users want to see improved:</p><ul><li>Support for promoting apps through stages and managing service dependencies.</li><li>Better templating in ApplicationSets, progressive syncs, and built-in promotion workflows.</li><li>Multi-cluster visibility and faster UI performance.</li><li>Enterprise-grade features like fine-grained RBAC, audit trails, Vault and Prometheus integrations, and better error messages.</li></ul><p>As teams scale up, these requests point toward a natural next step: evolving Argo CD into a full-featured, enterprise-ready platform.</p><h4>Final words</h4><p>The 2025 survey gave us a ton to think about. We saw just how far Argo CD has come, what’s working well, and what needs more attention. All these insights are gold for the project’s future evolution.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to share feedback!</p><p>Special shoutout to those who offered to help with case studies, blog posts, talks, or quotes.

With v3.1, the first batch of features comes out of the gate; featuring <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">OCI</a> support, CLI Plugins, Hydrator updates, UI improvements, plus much more.</p><p>Along with new features, this release comes with a whole slew of security fixes, bug fixes, and general quality of life improvements.</p><p>You can download the v3.1 on the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">Argo CD Releases Page</a>!</p><p>We are really excited to have you try out the new features and look forward to any feedback from the border community! With that, let’s dive into what this release holds!</p><h3>OCI Support</h3><p>Argo CD has supported obtaining Kubernetes manifests from either a Git repository, a Helm chart repository, and later support for getting manifests from a Helm chart stored within an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry. As OCI registries have more frequently been used to store content aside from container images, more and more projects have been adding support for using OCI as a storage mechanism and a source of truth.</p><p>Starting with Argo CD v3.1, we now support OCI by enabling the use of OCI-compliant container registries as sources for configuration artifacts. This means Argo CD can pull Kubernetes manifests packaged as OCI artifacts from registries that follow the OCI image and distribution specifications. This enhances security and portability, as it allows users to leverage the same registries they use for container images to also store and distribute deployment configurations. Argo CD OCI support comes into beta with this release.</p><p>BIG thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">@blakepettersson</a> from Akuity for leading this effort!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements</h3><p>Manifest changes are often just image tag bumps. For example, the manifest change associated with a code change. The manifest hydrator writes metadata to the hydrated branch to associate the hydrated commit back to its corresponding dry commit.</p><p>Starting in v3.1, the Hydrator now allows for a way to associate a dry commit with a code commit. This is done by adding information about the upstream repo url, that commit SHA hash, the author of that commit, and any messages associated with that code commit. This information is then added to the Hydrator manifest metadata; this enables future work to be able to display this metadata in the Argo CD UI.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a> from Intuit for this improvement.</p><h3>Server-Side Apply Stabilization</h3><p>Argo CD now supports client-side apply migration, which helps transitioning from client-side apply to server-side apply by moving a resource’s managed fields from one manager to Argo CD’s manager. This feature is particularly useful when you need to migrate existing resources that were created using kubectl client-side apply to server-side apply with Argo CD. You can also specify your own field manager to migrate from using an annotation. This is useful when you have other operators managing resources that are no longer in use and would like Argo CD to own all the fields for that operator.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">@pjiang-dev</a> from Intuit for this contribution.</p><h3>UI Parameterized Action</h3><p>The Argo CD UI in many ways is the first Kubernetes dashboard, providing not only a UI for GitOps users; but also a feature rich UI for Kubernetes end users. In this release, we’ve added the ability to perform additional action on Kubernetes resources, beyond just deleting.</p><p>This feature enables users to scale resources directly from the Argo CD UI. Users will be able to increase or decrease the number of replicas (Pods) for Deployments and StatefulSets by using an input field. The feature aims to enhance user experience, especially for non-technical users, by eliminating the need to modify configuration files or use kubectl commands for scaling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7C4pCbBqylNOEFKm\" /><figcaption>Scaling resource from Argo CD UI</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ratulbasak\">@ratulbasak</a> from Deutsche Bank for contributing!</p><h3>And We Didn’t Stop There</h3><p>There are other notable updates/improvements in this release.</p><ul><li>Similar to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/\">kubectl plugin mechanism</a>, support for <em>argocd</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20074\">CLI plugins</a> is available in this release. — <a href=\"https://github.com/nitishfy\">@nitishify</a></li><li>You can now <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22482\">explicitly set auto-sync</a> on an Application — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li>The sync option <em>SkipDryRunOnMissingResource</em> was only available as an annotation before; now you can set this as an Application sync option — <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">@pasha-codefresh</a></li><li>Improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22781\">AppSet Progressive Sync in the UI</a>, paving the path for it to enter Beta — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23057\">Add cooldown</a> to prevent resetting autoheal exp backoff preemptively — <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">@gdsoumya</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22864\">Added GitHub API metrics</a> to better debug rate limiting — <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a></li></ul><h3>Dependency, Platform, and Security Updates</h3><p>Some notable dependency, platform, and security updates included in v3.1</p><p><strong>Go 1.24.4</strong></p><ul><li>All builds, CI, and images now use the latest Go.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x.

Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>.

One such example would be some performance-related configurations.</p><p>This release will also address long-existing technical debt, caused by supporting legacy configurations we started with when Argo CD was young, and which we no longer recommend on using, as Argo CD had matured.</p><h3><strong>What Is Changing in This Version?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/milestone/27?closed=1\">Here</a> is a non-exhaustive list of changes in this release, among those:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19768\">Removal</a> of support for legacy argocd-cm repository config</li><li>Enabling fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19988\">by default</a></li><li>Making applyNestedSelectors: true the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/14152\">default and only</a> option for matrix/merge generators</li><li>Having an <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">opinion</a> on secrets — while we remained un-opinionated regarding secret management with Argo CD since day 1, maintainability and security lessons learned surfaced the need to be better aligned with the industry in this domain</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21207\">Preventing</a> the usage of in-cluster, when in-cluster is explicitly disabled</li></ol><h3>Backwards Compatibility &amp; Migration</h3><p>We aim for v3 release to be so inoffensive, that upgrading to 3.0 is almost as easy as upgrading between 2.x minor versions has been.</p><p>For each change, the documentation will contain clear description of:</p><ol><li>What the change is</li><li>How to determine whether the user is affected by the change (i.e which command to run)</li><li>How to migrate</li><li>For relatively high-risk changes - how to opt out (i.e switch back to the old default)</li></ol><h3>Get Involved</h3><p>You can read the full proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21422\">here</a>. Please give us your feedback!</p><p>If there are additional breaking changes you are aware of, that are aligned with the 3.0 proposed concepts, and can further improve Argo CD configuration, please open an issue for those.</p><p>We look forward to continuing the conversation with the Argo CD community.</p><h3>Call for Contributions</h3><p>We have labeled some issues planned for v3, which we would love to get contributions for (and this is a breathing list!), <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av3.0%20%20label%3Acontributions-wanted\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>This is your opportunity to become an active part of this release!</p><h3><strong>Support for Older Versions</strong></h3><p>At the release date of v3 GA, the following versions will be supported: v2.14 and v2.13, as per the regular support policy for minor versions.</p><h3>Planned Release Dates</h3><p>The v3 RC is currently planned for Mar. 17, 2025 and v3 GA for May 6, 2025.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=df05c0b39ad6\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/announcing-argo-cd-v3-small-but-mighty-df05c0b39ad6\">Announcing Argo CD v3: Small But Mighty</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

favor of the IPv6 state when deciding whether new iptables rules needed to be applied.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56587\">Issue #56587</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where our tag watcher code didn&rsquo;t consider the default revision to be the same as the default tag. This would cause issues where Kubernetes gateways wouldn&rsquo;t be programmed.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56767\">Issue #56767</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing Gateway chart installation failures with Helm v3.18.5 due to a stricter JSON schema validator. The chart&rsquo;s schema has been updated to be compatible.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57354\">Issue #57354</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>PreserveHeaderCase</code> option was overriding other HTTP/1.x protocol options, such as HTTP/1.0.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57528\">Issue #57528</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a change in output of <code>istioctl proxy-status</code> to be more consistent with previous versions.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57339\">Issue #57339</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> iptables detection logic to fall back to <code>iptables-nft</code> when the <code>iptable_nat</code> module is missing.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57380\">Issue #57380</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug that incorrectly rejected traffic policies when only <code>retry_budget</code> was set.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>According to Istio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-policy\">support policy</a>, minor releases like 1.25 are supported until six weeks after the N+2 minor release (1.27 in this case). <a href=\"https://istio.io/news/releases/1.27.x/announcing-1.27/\">Istio 1.27 was released on August 11th, 2025</a>, and support for 1.25 will end on September 22nd, 2025.</p>\n<p>At that point we will stop back-porting fixes for security issues and critical bugs to 1.25, so we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version of Istio (1.27.1). If you don&rsquo;t do this you may put yourself in the position of having to do a major upgrade on a short timeframe to pick up a critical fix.</p>\n<p>We care about you and your clusters, so please be kind to yourself and upgrade.</p>",

href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> is an official Kubernetes project designed to optimize the self-hosting of Generative AI models on Kubernetes. It provides a standardized, vendor-neutral approach to intelligent AI traffic management.</p>\n<p>Istio 1.27 includes a <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/gateways/#istio\">fully-compliant implementation</a> of the extension when using the Gateway API for cluster ingress traffic control.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2025/inference-extension-support/\">Learn more about the extension and Istio&rsquo;s implementation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambient-multicluster\">Ambient Multicluster</h3>\n<p>Support for multi-cluster deployments in ambient mode is now available in Alpha. This enables multiple ambient mode clusters to be connected into the same mesh, expanding the scope of no-sidecar networking to larger and more distributed environments.</p>\n<p>In this initial release, testing has been focused on multi-network, multi-primary topologies, where each cluster runs its own control plane. Support for more complex topologies will follow as the baseline feature matures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-support-for-plugged-in-cas\">CRL Support for Plugged-in CAs</h3>\n<p>Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support is now available for users who have &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; their own certificate authority, rather than using the default provided by Istio.  This allows proxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of mesh deployments using plugged-in CAs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"listenersets-support\">ListenerSets Support</h3>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1713\">ListenerSets</a> API allows you to define a reusable set of listeners that can be attached to a <code>Gateway</code> resource. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication when managing multiple Gateways that share common listener configurations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"native-nftables-support-in-sidecar-mode\">Native nftables Support in Sidecar Mode</h3>\n<p>Istio now supports the <a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47821\">native nftables</a> backend in Sidecar mode. nftables is the modern successor to iptables, providing better performance, improved maintainability, and more flexible rule management for transparent traffic redirection to and from the Envoy sidecar proxy.</p>\n<p>Many major Linux distributions are adopting nftables as the default packet filtering framework, and Istio’s native support ensures compatibility with this shift.</p>\n<p>Support for nftables in ambient mode is actively being developed and will arrive in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-127\">Upgrading to 1.27</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.27.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> traffic distribution to disregard subzone when the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field is set to <code>PreferClose</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for multiple server certificates in gateway (istio &amp; Gateway API). (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36181\">Issue #36181</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> alpha support for specifying <code>ServiceScope</code> in the MeshConfig in ambient multicluster configurations.\n<code>ServiceScope</code> enables the selection of individual services or services in a namespace to be global or local.\nA locally scoped service is only discoverable by the data plane in the same cluster as the service. A local\nservice is not discoverable by the data planes in other clusters. A globally-scoped service is discoverable\nby the data planes in all clusters. Defining selectors for the <code>serviceScopeConfigs</code> determines which services\nand workloads are shared with the data plane and which clusters and listeners are configured for the waypoints\n(including e/w gateways) in the mesh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature flag <code>EnableGatewayAPICopyLabelsAnnotations</code> to allow\nusers to choose whether the deployment resources will inherit attributes from\nthe parent Gateway API resource. This feature is enabled by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>PreferSameNode</code> and <code>PreferSameZone</code> on the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Pilot environment variables <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV4_PREFIX</code> and <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV6_PREFIX</code> to configure the IP CIDR prefix(es) for auto-allocated IPs. This allows users to set a specific range of IPs for auto-allocation, providing more control over the IP address space used for VIPs by the ipallocate controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> logging of a secret&rsquo;s namespace and name when a certificate is invalid.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56651\">Issue #56651</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a>.\nThis feature is off by default and can be turned on with the <code>SUPPORT_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION</code> environment variable.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55768\">Issue #55768</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for merge operations when applying to <code>LISTENER_FILTER</code> in EnvoyFilter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> that allows to enable lazy initialization of sidecar resources,\nOnly computing internal indexes when <code>SidecarScopes</code> are actually used by a Proxy. This feature supersedes the\nprevious <code>PILOT_CONVERT_SIDECAR_SCOPE_CONCURRENCY</code> which would allow concurrent conversion with specific given concurrency,\ninstead <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> will use the same concurrency as <code>PILOT_PUSH_THROTTLE</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for native <code>nftables</code> when using Istio sidecar mode. This update makes it possible to use <code>nftables</code>\ninstead of iptables to manage network rules, offering more efficient approach to traffic redirection for pods and\nservices. To enable the <code>nftables</code> mode, use <code>--set values.global.nativeNftables=true</code> at the time of installation.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56487\">Issue #56487</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying traffic distribution mode for services. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53354\">Issue #53354</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_PROXY_FIND_POD_BY_IP</code> that allows enabling association of Pods to Proxies by IP address, if the association by name and namespace fails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support of retry budget in <code>DestinationRule</code> resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the gateway status controller leader election was not running per revision, which could lead to issues in multi-revision setups.\nThe leader election is now correctly scoped to each revision, ensuring that the gateway status controller operates independently for each revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55717\">Issue #55717</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where virtual service routes were ignored when the virtual service was configured with hosts containing mixed-case letters.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55767\">Issue #55767</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a regression in Istio 1.26.0 that caused a panic in istiod when processing Gateway API hostnames.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56300\">Issue #56300</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where mTLS was disabled unexpectedly when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> or <code>PILOT_ENDPOINT_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> was set to <code>false</code>\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56352\">Issue #56352</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ambient host network iptables rules were being skipped due to higher-priority CNI rules in some deployments.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56414\">Issue #56414</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with <code>targetRefs</code> matched incorrect resources.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56417\">Issue #56417</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> ambient index to filter configurations by their revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477\">Issue #56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label was not properly skipped on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> were in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI plugin incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod, which had been deleted, to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurred, ztunnel would not be able to become ready.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56738\">Issue #56738</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio&rsquo;s outbound route configuration did not include the absolute domain name  (fully-qualified domain name with trailing dot) in the domains list for <code>VirtualHost</code> entries. This change ensures that requests using absolute domain names (ending with a dot, e.g., <code>my-service.my-ns.svc.cluster.local.</code>) are properly routed to the intended service instead of falling back to <code>PassthroughCluster</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56007\">Issue #56007</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for omitting the issuer claim in JWT tokens. Either the issuer claim or a <code>JWKSUri</code> is required,\nbut not both. This allows for more flexible configurations when using JWT tokens for authentication, particularly\nin scenarios where the issuer claim may be dynamic. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14400\">Issue #14400</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an opt-in feature when using istio-cni in ambient mode, to create an Istio-owned CNI config\nfile which contains the contents of the primary CNI config file and the Istio CNI plugin. This\nopt-in feature is a solution to the issue of traffic bypassing the mesh on node restart when the\nIstio CNI <code>DaemonSet</code> is not ready, the Istio CNI plugin is not installed, or the plugin is not\ninvoked to configure traffic redirection from pods their node ztunnels. This feature is enabled by\nsetting <code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfig</code> to true in the istio-cni Helm chart values. If no value is set for\n<code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code>, the Istio-owned CNI config file will be named <code>02-istio-cni.conflist</code>.\nThe <code>istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code> value must have a higher lexicographical priority than the primary CNI.\nAmbient and chained CNI plugins must be enabled for this feature to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> validation for the istioctl <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument. It should not have more than one alias per cluster.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> by migrating from <code>certificates.k8s.io/v1alpha1</code> to the stable <code>v1beta1</code> API in Kubernetes 1.33+. This improves compatibility and future-proofs Istio’s certificate distribution mechanism.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56306\">Issue #56306</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for external Secret Discovery Service (SDS) providers in the Gateway TLS configuration. Istio now provides\nimproved integration with external SDS providers for TLS certificate management at the Gateway.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56522\">Issue #56522</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> certificate revocation list (CRL) support for plugged-in CAs, enabling Istio to watch for <code>ca-crl.pem</code> files and\nautomatically distribute CRLs across all namespaces in the cluster. This enhancement allows\nproxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of service mesh deployments\nusing plugged-in CAs.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56529\">Issue #56529</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) option to <code>COMPLIANCE_POLICY</code>.\nThis policy enforces TLS <code>v1.3</code>, cipher suites <code>TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> and <code>TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code>,\nand post-quantum-safe key exchange <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.\nTo enable this compliance policy in ambient mode, it must be set in the pilot and ztunnel containers.\nThis policy applies to the following data paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mTLS communication between Envoy proxies and ztunnels;</li>\n<li>regular TLS on the downstream and the upstream of Envoy proxies (e.g. gateway);</li>\n<li>Istio xDS server.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56330\">Issue #56330</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where sidecars with the old <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> setting were not able to connect to istiod with the new <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> settings when <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument was being used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the <code>pluginca</code> feature where <code>istiod</code> would silently fallback to the self-signed CA if the provided <code>cacerts</code> bundle was incomplete.\nThe system now properly validates the presence of all required CA files and fails with an error if the bundle is incomplete.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Grafana dashboard was linking to the Istio Mesh Dashboard using path-based links that no longer work. Workload and Service links now use dashboard UIDs.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50124\">Issue #50124</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not being updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825\">Issue #56825</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> support of the <code>Lightstep</code> tracing provider.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54002\">Issue #54002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"extensibility\">Extensibility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added</strong> an option to reload the Wasm VM on new requests if the VM has failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> the environment variable <code>ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS</code> to default to <code>true</code>. This means native sidecars will be injected into all eligible pods unless explicitly disabled.\nThis can be disabled explicitly or for specific workloads by adding the annotation <code>sidecar.istio.io/native-side: &quot;false&quot;</code> to individual pods or pod templates.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/48794\">Issue #48794</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a setting <code>values.global.trustBundleName</code> that allows configuring the name of the ConfigMap that istiod uses to propagate its root CA certificate in the cluster. This allows running multiple control planes with overlapping namespaces in the same cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for customizing ambient enablement Labels.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53578\">Issue #53578</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring <code>additionalContainers</code> and <code>initContainers</code> on the Gateway Helm Chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring ztunnel tolerations via Helm chart values.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56086\">Issue #56086</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring istio-cni tolerations via Helm chart values.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56087\">Issue #56087</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> defined defaults for <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> and <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> divisors to fix an Argo perpetual out-of-sync issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> bootstrap override config for the <code>gateway-injection-template</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28302\">Issue #28302</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS</code> Helm value in the compatibility profiles of Istio 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26, allowing users to disable the default enabling of native sidecars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for proxy protocol on status port. (<a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/reference/commands/pilot-agent/#envvars\">reference</a>)\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39868\">Issue #39868</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Helm value <code>.Values.istiodRemote.enabledLocalInjectorIstiod</code> to support sidecar injection in remote clusters.\nWhen <code>profile=remote</code>, <code>.Values.istiodRemote.enabledLocalInjectorIstiod=true</code>, and <code>.Values.global.remotePilotAddress=&quot;${DISCOVERY_ADDRESS}&quot;</code>,\nthe remote worker cluster installs <code>istiod</code> for local sidecar injection, while XDS is still served by the remote primary cluster.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56328\">Issue #56328</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label to the istio remote service when <code>istiodRemote</code> is enabled\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56142\">Issue #56142</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>deploymentAnnotations</code> in the istiod Helm chart. Users can now specify custom annotations to be applied to the istiod Deployment object, in addition to the existing <code>podAnnotations</code> support. This is useful for integration with monitoring tools, GitOps workflows, and policy enforcement systems that operate at the deployment level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>ISTIO_KUBE_APP_PROBERS</code> environment variable was not set for probe rewrites when the Istio webhook was re-invoked.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56102\">Issue #56102</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where secrets references in the env of <code>istio/gateway</code> Helm chart were incorrectly rendered as a string.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55141\">Issue #55141</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an injection failure that occurred when the <code>gateway</code> template was combined with another template, like <code>spire</code>,\nwhich overrides <code>workload-socket</code>, resulted in Kubernetes not creating other volumes, like those with <code>emptyDir</code> and <code>csi</code> settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a panic in <code>istioctl manifest translate</code> when the <code>IstioOperator</code> config contained multiple gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56223\">Issue #56223</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> assignment of incorrect UIDs and GIDs for <code>istio-proxy</code> and <code>istio-validation</code> containers on OpenShift clusters when TPROXY mode was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> was not properly configured when <code>ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API</code> was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> unused multicluster-related Helm values.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the <code>--kubeclient-timeout</code> flag to <code>istioctl</code> root flags. May be unset, or set to a valid <code>time.Duration</code> string.\nWhen specified, this will override the default <code>15s</code> timeout for all <code>istioctl</code> commands that use the Kubernetes client.\nThis is useful for environments with slow Kubernetes API servers, such as those with high latency or low bandwidth.\nNote that this flag is just used for the Kubernetes client, and does not affect other timeouts in <code>istioctl</code>, such as\ninstallation timeouts. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54962\">Issue #54962</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>--revision</code> flags for <code>istioctl dashboard controlz</code> and <code>istioctl dashboard istiod-debug</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support in the <code>istioctl proxy-status</code> command to dynamically display all xDS/CRD types as columns in the output table.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56005\">Issue #56005</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for customizing the timeout of <code>istioctl waypoint status</code> and <code>istioctl waypoint apply</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56453\">Issue #56453</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for displaying <code>stack-trace-level</code> in the command <code>istioctl admin log</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56465\">Issue #56465</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for displaying <code>traffic type</code> in the command <code>istioctl waypoint list</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>--weight</code> parameter in the command <code>istioctl experimental workload group create</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring the log level of <code>ip-autoallocate</code> in <code>istioctl admin log</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55741\">Issue #55741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where, during installation, <code>istio-revision-tag-default</code> and <code>MutatingWebhookConfiguration</code> were not created when the revision was not the default.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55980\">Issue #55980</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where false positive of IST0134 were raised in <code>istioctl analyze</code> when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE</code> was set to <code>true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56083\">Issue #56083</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where analysis included Kubernetes system namespaces (e.g., <code>kube-system</code>, <code>kube-node-lease</code>).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55022\">Issue #55022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>create-remote-secret</code> created redundant RBAC resources.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56558\">Issue #56558</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

a <code>tie</code> situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing false positives with <code>istioctl analyze</code> raising IST0134 even when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE</code> was set to <code>true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56083\">Issue #56083</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a panic in <code>istioctl manifest translate</code> when the IstioOperator config contained multiple gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56223\">Issue

enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> logic to properly ignore the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> are in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not updated when the referenced service was

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>. In the spirit of End User confidence, we decided to track their results while they position themselves as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.</p>\n<h3>aaS</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronosphere</li>\n<li>Grafana Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>New Relic</li>\n<li>Sysdig Monitor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: As Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on Cortex just like Grafana Cloud, we expect them to pass after the next update cycle.</p>\n<h2>Agent/Collector</h2>\n<h3>Passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafana Agent 0.19.0</li>\n<li>OpenTelemetry Collector 0.37.0</li>\n<li>Prometheus 2.30.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Telegraf 1.20.2</li>\n<li>Timber Vector 0.16.1</li>\n<li>VictoriaMetrics Agent 1.67.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: We tested Vector 0.16.1 instead of 0.17.0 because there are no binary downloads for 0.17.0 and our test toolchain currently expects binaries.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>It has been more than half a year since our last official kube-router release, so I think we're more than past time to do so. Additionally, there have been quite a few items that have been fixed or upgraded.</p>\n<h3>Highlights &amp; Changed Functionality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Network Services Controller (enabled via <code>--run-service-proxy</code>) now fetches metrics when the metrics URL is hit rather than on the sync period (<code>--ipvs-sync-period</code>). This allows for more fine-grained and up-to-date metrics on IPVS services. (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rkojedzinszky\">@rkojedzinszky</a>!)</li>\n<li>Service's <code>externalIP</code> and <code>LoadBalancerIP</code> are now labels on IPVS metrics which can increase cardinality, but also provides better visibility for services. Prior to this, only the <code>ClusterIP</code> or <code>NodePort</code> labels were added to metrics.</li>\n<li>The GoBGP port can be changed or disabled via <code>--gpbgp-admin-port</code> to create more secure / flexible deployments of kube-router</li>\n<li>We converted a lot of exec's  out to <code>iproute2</code> into <code>netlink</code> library calls, making the code more idiomatic, faster, and less fragile to userspace tooling changes</li>\n<li>When both DSR and Maglev is enabled on a service kube-router will automatically enable the kernel option <code>sloppy_tcp</code> for IPVS which allows for greater service routing consistency when transitioning nodes (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/AnupamGhosh\">@AnupamGhosh</a>!)</li>\n<li>All references to Endpoints has been removed since the API is now fully deprecated and EndpointSlices is now used behind the scenes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1895\">1895</a> - IPv6 NDP NA/NS dropped when using egress network policy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1875\">1875</a> - Collect service statistics real-time</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1860\">1888</a> -

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

This one fixes an issue with TCP MSS clamping (e.g. packet MTU's not being properly negotiated during TCP handshake) and an issue where iptables wasn't properly identifying that rules existed in chains causing iptables definitions to increase with every call to sync NetworkPolicy ending up in linear growth of iptables rule definitions.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rkojedzinszky\">@rkojedzinszky</a> for fixing the TCP MSS clamping on DSR services.</p>\n<h2>Other Notes</h2>\n<p>The iptables definition growth was seemingly caused by iptables user-space tooling v1.8.10 which means that this likely only affected users of the kube-router container that was updated to alpine 3.19. User's using kube-router as a daemon outside a container runtime, may want to be wary of updating the iptables user-space to that version.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/f6c45f37e42d96f8498aa01e81bb41f25fe11edc\"><tt>f6c45f3</tt></a> - feat(alpine): revert 3.19 -&gt; 3.18 <code>&lt;Aaron U'Ren&gt;</code></li>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e980a17bddf4525b2f9a9f762e9b3c798b3226f4\"><tt>e980a17</tt></a> - fix(nsc): remove previous TCPMSS rules during setting up DSR <code>&lt;Richard Kojedzinszky&gt;</code></li>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/defdf64a83b860411e37b09327964efbddcbf2b1\"><tt>defdf64</tt></a> - fix(nsc): remove previous TCPMSS rules <code>&lt;Aaron U'Ren&gt;</code></li>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/b1070f113f6c0f35673af1d64c5fe58fecd21f76\"><tt>b1070f1</tt></a> - feat(nsc): apply TCPMSS rules on kube-bridge interface only <code>&lt;Richard Kojedzinszky&gt;</code></li>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/5fdde0681fa9abd94fcab386ef10677a1a9d6366\"><tt>5fdde06</tt></a> - fix(nsc): TCPMSS rules are created per-service and for reply packets only <code>&lt;Richard Kojedzinszky&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>",
