This v1.31 enhancement allowed the watch cache to be used for strongly-consistent read requests for the first time, a huge win as it enabled <em>filtered collections</em> (e.g. &quot;a list of pods bound to this node&quot;) to be safely served from the cache instead of etcd, dramatically reducing its load for common workloads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"taming-large-responses-with-streaming-beta-in-v1-33\">Taming large responses with streaming (Beta in v1.33)</h3>\n<p>Another key improvement was tackling the problem of memory spikes when transmitting large responses. The streaming encoder, introduced in v1.33, allowed the API server to send list items one by one, rather than buffering the entire multi-gigabyte response in memory. This made the memory cost of sending a response predictable and minimal, regardless of its size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-missing-piece\">The missing piece</h3>\n<p>Despite these huge improvements, a critical gap remained. Any request for a historical <code>LIST</code>—most commonly used for paginating through large result sets—still had to bypass the cache and query <code>etcd</code> directly. This meant that the cost of <em>retrieving</em> the data was still unpredictable and could put significant memory pressure on the API server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-1-34-snapshots-complete-the-picture\">Kubernetes 1.34: snapshots complete the picture</h2>\n<p>The <em>snapshottable API server cache</em> solves this final piece of the puzzle.\nThis feature enhances the watch cache, enabling it to generate efficient, point-in-time snapshots of its state.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works: for each update, the cache creates a lightweight snapshot.\nThese snapshots are &quot;lazy copies,&quot; meaning they don't duplicate objects but simply store pointers, making them incredibly memory-efficient.</p>\n<p>When a <strong>list</strong> request for a historical <code>resourceVersion</code> arrives, the API server now finds the corresponding snapshot and serves the response directly from its memory.\nThis closes the final major gap, allowing paginated requests to be served entirely from the cache.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-era-of-api-server-performance\">A new era of API Server performance 🚀</h2>\n<p>With this final piece in place, the synergy of these three features ushers in a new era of API server predictability and performance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get Data from Cache</strong>: <em>Consistent reads</em> and <em>snapshottable cache</em> work together to ensure nearly all read requests—whether for the latest data or a historical snapshot—are served from the API server's memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Send data via stream</strong>: <em>Streaming list responses</em> ensure that sending this data to the client has a minimal and constant memory footprint.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The result is a system where the resource cost of read operations is almost fully predictable and much more resiliant to spikes in request load.\nThis means dramatically reduced memory pressure, a lighter load on <code>etcd</code>, and a more stable, scalable, and reliable control plane for all Kubernetes clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-started\">How to get started</h2>\n<p>With its graduation to Beta, the <code>SnapshottableCache</code> feature gate is <strong>enabled by default</strong> in Kubernetes v1.34. There are no actions required to start benefiting from these performance and stability improvements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Special thanks for designing, implementing, and reviewing these critical features go to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ahmad Zolfaghari</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/ah8ad3\">@ah8ad3</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Ben Luddy</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/benluddy\">@benluddy</a>) – <em>Red Hat</em></li>\n<li><strong>Chen Chen</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/z1cheng\">@z1cheng</a>) – <em>Microsoft</em></li>\n<li><strong>Davanum Srinivas</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/dims\">@dims</a>) – <em>Nvidia</em></li>\n<li><strong>David Eads</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/deads2k\">@deads2k</a>) – <em>Red Hat</em></li>\n<li><strong>Han Kang</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/logicalhan\">@logicalhan</a>) – <em>CoreWeave</em></li>\n<li><strong>haosdent</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/haosdent\">@haosdent</a>) – <em>Shopee</em></li>\n<li><strong>Joe Betz</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/jpbetz\">@jpbetz</a>) – <em>Google</em></li>\n<li><strong>Jordan Liggitt</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/liggitt\">@liggitt</a>) – <em>Google</em></li>\n<li><strong>Łukasz Szaszkiewicz</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/p0lyn0mial\">@p0lyn0mial</a>) – <em>Red Hat</em></li>\n<li><strong>Maciej Borsz</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/mborsz\">@mborsz</a>) – <em>Google</em></li>\n<li><strong>Madhav Jivrajani</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/MadhavJivrajani\">@MadhavJivrajani</a>) – <em>UIUC</em></li>\n<li><strong>Marek Siarkowicz</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/serathius\">@serathius</a>) – <em>Google</em></li>\n<li><strong>NKeert</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/NKeert\">@NKeert</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Tim Bannister</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/lmktfy\">@lmktfy</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Wei Fu</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/fuweid\">@fuweid</a>) - <em>Microsoft</em></li>\n<li><strong>Wojtek Tyczyński</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/wojtek-t\">@wojtek-t</a>) – <em>Google</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>...and many others in SIG API Machinery.

      "summary": "<p>The VolumeAttributesClass API, which empowers users to dynamically modify volume attributes, has officially graduated to General Availability (GA) in Kubernetes v1.34. This marks a significant milestone, providing a robust and stable way to tune your persistent storage directly within Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-volumeattributesclass\">What is VolumeAttributesClass?</h2>\n<p>At its core, VolumeAttributesClass is a cluster-scoped resource that defines a set of mutable parameters for a volume. Think of it as a &quot;profile&quot; for your storage, allowing cluster administrators to expose different quality-of-service (QoS) levels or performance tiers.</p>\n<p>Users can then specify a <code>volumeAttributesClassName</code> in their PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to indicate which class of attributes they desire. The magic happens through the Container Storage Interface (CSI): when a PVC referencing a VolumeAttributesClass is updated, the associated CSI driver interacts with the underlying storage system to apply the specified changes to the volume.</p>\n<p>This means you can now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamically scale performance: Increase IOPS or throughput for a busy database, or reduce it for a less critical application.</li>\n<li>Optimize costs: Adjust attributes on the fly to match your current needs, avoiding over-provisioning.</li>\n<li>Simplify operations: Manage volume modifications directly within the Kubernetes API, rather than relying on external tools or manual processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-new-from-beta-to-ga\">What is new from Beta to GA</h2>\n<p>There are two major enhancements from beta.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cancel-support-from-infeasible-errors\">Cancel support from infeasible errors</h3>\n<p>To improve resilience and user experience, the GA release introduces explicit cancel support when a requested volume modification becomes infeasible. If the underlying storage system or CSI driver indicates that the requested changes cannot be applied (e.g., due to invalid arguments), users can cancel the operation and revert the volume to its previous stable configuration, preventing the volume from being left in an inconsistent state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quota-support-based-on-scope\">Quota support based on scope</h3>\n<p>While VolumeAttributesClass doesn't add a new quota type, the Kubernetes control plane can be configured to enforce quotas on PersistentVolumeClaims that reference a specific VolumeAttributesClass.</p>\n<p>This is achieved by using the <code>scopeSelector</code> field in a ResourceQuota to target PVCs that have <code>.spec.volumeAttributesClassName</code> set to a particular VolumeAttributesClass name. Please see more details <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/#resource-quota-per-volumeattributesclass\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"drivers-support-volumeattributesclass\">Drivers support VolumeAttributesClass</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon EBS CSI Driver: The AWS EBS CSI driver has robust support for VolumeAttributesClass and allows you to modify parameters like volume type (e.g., gp2 to gp3, io1 to io2), IOPS, and throughput of EBS volumes dynamically.</li>\n<li>Google Compute Engine (GCE) Persistent Disk CSI Driver (pd.csi.storage.gke.io): This driver also supports dynamic modification of persistent disk attributes, including IOPS and throughput, via VolumeAttributesClass.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"contact\">Contact</h2>\n<p>For any inquiries or specific questions related to VolumeAttributesClass, please reach out to the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-storage\">SIG Storage community</a>.</p>",

      "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>In Kubernetes v1.34, the <em>Pod replacement policy</em> feature has reached general availability (GA).\nThis blog post describes the Pod replacement policy feature and how to use it in your Jobs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-pod-replacement-policy\">About Pod Replacement Policy</h2>\n<p>By default, the Job controller immediately recreates Pods as soon as they fail or begin terminating (when they have a deletion timestamp).</p>\n<p>As a result, while some Pods are terminating, the total number of running Pods for a Job can temporarily exceed the specified parallelism.\nFor Indexed Jobs, this can even mean multiple Pods running for the same index at the same time.</p>\n<p>This behavior works fine for many workloads, but it can cause problems in certain cases.</p>\n<p>For example, popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and\n<a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">JAX</a> expect exactly one Pod per worker index.\nIf two Pods run at the same time, you might encounter errors such as:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>/job:worker/task:4: Duplicate task registration with task_name=/job:worker/replica:0/task:4\n</code></pre><p>Additionally, starting replacement Pods before the old ones fully terminate can lead to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scheduling delays by kube-scheduler as the nodes remain occupied.</li>\n<li>Unnecessary cluster scale-ups to accommodate the replacement Pods.</li>\n<li>Temporary bypassing of quota checks by workload orchestrators like <a href=\"https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/\">Kueue</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Pod replacement policy, Kubernetes gives you control over when the control plane\nreplaces terminating Pods, helping you avoid these issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-pod-replacement-policy-works\">How Pod Replacement Policy works</h2>\n<p>This enhancement means that Jobs in Kubernetes have an optional field <code>.spec.podReplacementPolicy</code>.<br />\nYou can choose one of two policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>TerminatingOrFailed</code> (default): Replaces Pods as soon as they start terminating.</li>\n<li><code>Failed</code>: Replaces Pods only after they fully terminate and transition to the <code>Failed</code> phase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Setting the policy to <code>Failed</code> ensures that a new Pod is only created after the previous one has completely terminated.</p>\n<p>For Jobs with a Pod Failure Policy, the default <code>podReplacementPolicy</code> is <code>Failed</code>, and no other value is allowed.\nSee <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-failure-policy\">Pod Failure Policy</a> to learn more about Pod Failure Policies for Jobs.</p>\n<p>You can check how many Pods are currently terminating by inspecting the Job’s <code>.status.terminating</code> field:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display:

      "summary": "<p>As Kubernetes clusters grow in size and complexity, understanding the health and performance of individual nodes becomes increasingly critical. We are excited to announce that as of Kubernetes v1.34, <strong>Pressure Stall Information (PSI) Metrics</strong> has graduated to Beta.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-pressure-stall-information-psi\">What is Pressure Stall Information (PSI)?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/accounting/psi.html\">Pressure Stall Information (PSI)</a> is a feature of the Linux kernel (version 4.20 and later)\nthat provides a canonical way to quantify pressure on infrastructure resources,\nin terms of whether demand for a resource exceeds current supply.\nIt moves beyond simple resource utilization metrics and instead\nmeasures the amount of time that tasks are stalled due to resource contention.\nThis is a powerful way to identify and diagnose resource bottlenecks that can impact application performance.</p>\n<p>PSI exposes metrics for CPU, memory, and I/O, categorized as either <code>some</code> or <code>full</code> pressure:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>some</code></dt>\n<dd>The percentage of time that <strong>at least one</strong> task is stalled on a resource. This indicates some level of resource contention.</dd>\n<dt><code>full</code></dt>\n<dd>The percentage of time that <strong>all</strong> non-idle tasks are stalled on a resource simultaneously. This indicates a more severe resource bottleneck.</dd>\n</dl>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Diagram illustrating the difference between 'some' and 'full' PSI pressure.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/04/kubernetes-v1-34-introducing-psi-metrics-beta/psi-metrics-some-vs-full.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<h4>PSI: 'Some' vs. 'Full' Pressure</h4>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>These metrics are aggregated over 10-second, 1-minute, and 5-minute rolling windows, providing a comprehensive view of resource pressure over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psi-metrics-in-kubernetes\">PSI metrics in Kubernetes</h2>\n<p>With the <code>KubeletPSI</code> feature gate enabled, the kubelet can now collect PSI metrics from the Linux kernel and expose them through two channels: the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/node-metrics/#summary-api-source\">Summary API</a> and the <code>/metrics/cadvisor</code> Prometheus endpoint. This allows you to monitor and alert on resource pressure at the node, pod, and container level.</p>\n<p>The following new metrics are available in Prometheus exposition format via <code>/metrics/cadvisor</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>container_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_total</code></li>\n<li><code>container_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_total</code></li>\n<li><code>container_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_total</code></li>\n<li><code>container_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_total</code></li>\n<li><code>container_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_total</code></li>\n<li><code>container_pressure_io_waiting_seconds_total</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These metrics, along with the data from the Summary API, provide a granular view of resource pressure, enabling you to pinpoint the source of performance issues and take corrective action. For example, you can use these metrics to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identify memory leaks:</strong> A steadily increasing <code>some</code> pressure for memory can indicate a memory leak in an application.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize resource requests and limits:</strong> By understanding the resource pressure of your workloads, you can more accurately tune their resource requests and limits.</li>\n<li><strong>Autoscale workloads:</strong> You can use PSI metrics to trigger autoscaling events, ensuring that your workloads have the resources they need to perform optimally.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-enable-psi-metrics\">How to enable PSI metrics</h2>\n<p>To enable PSI metrics in your Kubernetes cluster, you need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ensure your nodes are running a Linux kernel version 4.20 or later and are using cgroup v2.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enable the <code>KubeletPSI</code> feature gate on the kubelet.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once enabled, you can start scraping the <code>/metrics/cadvisor</code> endpoint with your Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution or query the Summary API to collect and visualize the new PSI metrics. Note that PSI is a Linux-kernel feature, so these metrics are not available on Windows nodes. Your cluster can contain a mix of Linux and Windows nodes, and on the Windows nodes the kubelet does not expose PSI metrics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>We are excited to bring PSI metrics to the Kubernetes community and look forward to your feedback. As a beta feature, we are actively working on improving and extending this functionality towards a stable GA release. We encourage you to try it out and share your experiences with us.</p>\n<p>To learn more about PSI metrics, check out the official <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/understand-psi-metrics/\">Kubernetes documentation</a>. You can also get involved in the conversation on the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-node\">#sig-node</a> Slack channel.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>A new CPU Manager Static Policy Option called <code>prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache</code> was introduced in Kubernetes v1.32 as an alpha feature, and has graduated to <strong>beta</strong> in Kubernetes v1.34.\nThis CPU Manager Policy Option is designed to optimize performance for specific workloads running on processors with a <em>split uncore cache</em> architecture.\nIn this article, I'll explain what that means and why it's useful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-feature\">Understanding the feature</h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-uncore-cache\">What is uncore cache?</h3>\n<p>Until relatively recently, nearly all mainstream computer processors had a\nmonolithic last-level-cache cache that was shared across every core in a multiple\nCPU package.\nThis monolithic cache is also referred to as <em>uncore cache</em>\n(because it is not linked to a specific core), or as Level 3 cache.\nAs well as the Level 3 cache, there is other cache, commonly called Level 1 and Level 2 cache,\nthat <strong>is</strong> associated with a specific CPU core.</p>\n<p>In order to reduce access latency between the CPU cores and their cache, recent AMD64 and ARM\narchitecture based processors have introduced a <em>split uncore cache</em> architecture,\nwhere the last-level-cache is divided into multiple physical caches,\nthat are aligned to specific CPU groupings within the physical package.\nThe shorter distances within the CPU package help to reduce latency.\n<img alt=\"Diagram showing monolithic cache on the left and split cache on the right\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/02/kubernetes-v1-34-prefer-align-by-uncore-cache-cpumanager-static-policy-optimization/mono_vs_split_uncore.png\" /></p>\n<p>Kubernetes is able to place workloads in a way that accounts for the cache\ntopology within the CPU package(s).</p>\n<h3 id=\"cache-aware-workload-placement\">Cache-aware workload placement</h3>\n<p>The matrix below shows the <a href=\"https://github.com/nviennot/core-to-core-latency\">CPU-to-CPU latency</a> measured in nanoseconds (lower is better) when\npassing a packet between CPUs, via its cache coherence protocol on a processor that\nuses split uncore cache.\nIn this example, the processor package consists of 2 uncore caches.\nEach uncore cache serves 8 CPU cores.\n<img alt=\"Table showing CPU-to-CPU latency figures\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/02/kubernetes-v1-34-prefer-align-by-uncore-cache-cpumanager-static-policy-optimization/c2c_latency.png\" />\nBlue entries in the matrix represent latency between CPUs sharing the same uncore cache, while grey entries indicate latency between CPUs corresponding to different uncore caches. Latency between CPUs that correspond to different caches are higher than the latency between CPUs that belong to the same cache.</p>\n<p>With <code>prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache</code> enabled, the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/node-resource-managers/#static-policy\">static CPU Manager</a> attempts to allocates CPU resources for a container, such that all CPUs assigned to a container share the same uncore cache.\nThis policy operates on a best-effort basis, aiming to minimize the distribution of a container's CPU resources across uncore caches, based on the\ncontainer's requirements, and accounting for allocatable resources on the node.</p>\n<p>By running a workload, where it can, on a set of CPUS that use the smallest feasible number of uncore caches, applications benefit from reduced cache latency (as seen in the matrix above),\nand from reduced contention against other workloads, which can result in overall higher throughput.\nThe benefit only shows up if your nodes use a split uncore cache topology for their processors.</p>\n<p>The following diagram below illustrates uncore cache alignment when the feature is enabled.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Diagram showing an example workload CPU assignment, default static policy, and with prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/09/02/kubernetes-v1-34-prefer-align-by-uncore-cache-cpumanager-static-policy-optimization/cache-align-diagram.png\" /></p>\n<p>By default, Kubernetes does not account for uncore cache topology; containers are assigned CPU resources using a packed methodology.\nAs a result, Container 1 and Container 2 can experience a noisy neighbor impact due to\ncache access contention on Uncore Cache 0. Additionally, Container 2 will have CPUs distributed across both caches which can introduce a cross-cache latency.</p>\n<p>With <code>prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache</code> enabled, each container is isolated on an individual cache. This resolves the cache contention between the containers and minimizes the cache latency for the CPUs being utilized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-cases\">Use cases</h2>\n<p>Common use cases can include telco applications like vRAN, Mobile Packet Core, and Firewalls. It's important to note that the optimization provided by <code>prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache</code> can be dependent on the workload. For example, applications that are memory bandwidth bound may not benefit from uncore cache alignment, as utilizing more uncore caches can increase memory bandwidth access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-the-feature\">Enabling the feature</h2>\n<p>To enable this feature, set the CPU Manager Policy to <code>static</code> and enable the CPU Manager Policy Options with <code>prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache</code>.</p>\n<p>For Kubernetes 1.34, the feature is in the beta stage and requires the <code>CPUManagerPolicyBetaOptions</code>\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> to also be enabled.</p>\n<p>Append the following to the kubelet configuration file:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>KubeletConfiguration<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">featureGates</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>...<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">CPUManagerPolicyBetaOptions</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #a2f; font-weight: bold;\">true</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">cpuManagerPolicy</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"static\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">cpuManagerPolicyOptions</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"true\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">reservedSystemCPUs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"0\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #00f; font-weight: bold;\">...</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you're making this change to an existing node, remove the <code>cpu_manager_state</code> file and then restart kubelet.</p>\n<p><code>prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache</code> can be enabled on nodes with a monolithic uncore cache processor.

      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes 1.34 is here, and it has brought a huge wave of enhancements for Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)! This\nrelease marks a major milestone with many APIs in the <code>resource.k8s.io</code> group graduating to General Availability (GA),\nunlocking the full potential of how you manage devices on Kubernetes. On top of that, several key features have\nmoved to beta, and a fresh batch of new alpha features promise even more expressiveness and flexibility.</p>\n<p>Let's dive into what's new for DRA in Kubernetes 1.34!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-core-of-dra-is-now-ga\">The core of DRA is now GA</h2>\n<p>The headline feature of the v1.34 release is that the core of DRA has graduated to General Availability.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/\">Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)</a> provides\na flexible framework for managing specialized hardware and infrastructure resources, such as GPUs or FPGAs. DRA\nprovides APIs that enable each workload to specify the properties of the devices it needs, but leaving it to the\nscheduler to allocate actual devices, allowing increased reliability and improved utilization of expensive hardware.</p>\n<p>With the graduation to GA, DRA is stable and will be part of Kubernetes for the long run. The community can still\nexpect a steady stream of new features being added to DRA over the next several Kubernetes releases, but they will\nnot make any breaking changes to DRA. So users and developers of DRA drivers can start adopting DRA with confidence.</p>\n<p>Starting with Kubernetes 1.34, DRA is enabled by default; the DRA features that have reached beta are <strong>also</strong> enabled by default.\nThat's because the default API version for DRA is now the stable <code>v1</code> version, and not the earlier versions\n(eg: <code>v1beta1</code> or <code>v1beta2</code>) that needed explicit opt in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-promoted-to-beta\">Features promoted to beta</h2>\n<p>Several powerful features have been promoted to beta, adding more control, flexibility, and observability to resource\nmanagement with DRA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#admin-access\">Admin access labelling</a> has been updated.\nIn v1.34, you can restrict device support to people (or software) authorized to use it. This is meant\nas a way to avoid privilege escalation if a DRA driver grants additional privileges when admin access is requested\nand to avoid accessing devices which are in use by normal applications, potentially in another namespace.\nThe restriction works by ensuring that only users with access to a namespace with the\n<code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code> label are authorized to create\nResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplates objects with the <code>adminAccess</code> field set to true. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the feature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#prioritized-list\">Prioritized list</a> lets users specify\na list of acceptable devices for their workloads, rather than just a single type of device. So while the workload\nmight run best on a single high-performance GPU, it might also be able to run on 2 mid-level GPUs. The scheduler will\nattempt to satisfy the alternatives in the list in order, so the workload will be allocated the best set of devices\navailable on the node.</p>\n<p>The kubelet's API has been updated to report on Pod resources allocated through DRA. This allows node monitoring agents\nto know the allocated DRA resources for Pods on a node and makes it possible to use the DRA information in the PodResources API\nto develop new features and integrations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-alpha-features\">New alpha features</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.34 also introduces several new alpha features that give us a glimpse into the future of resource management with DRA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#extended-resource\">Extended resource mapping</a> support in DRA allows\ncluster administrators to advertise DRA-managed resources as <em>extended resources</em>, allowing developers to consume them using\nthe familiar, simpler request syntax while still benefiting from dynamic allocation. This makes it possible for existing\nworkloads to start using DRA without modifications, simplifying the transition to DRA for both application developers and\ncluster administrators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#consumable-capacity\">Consumable capacity</a> introduces a flexible\ndevice sharing model where multiple, independent resource claims from unrelated\npods can each be allocated a share of the same underlying physical device. This new capability is managed through optional,\nadministrator-defined sharing policies that govern how a device's total capacity is divided and enforced by the platform for\neach request. This allows for sharing of devices in scenarios where pre-defined partitions are not viable.\nA blog about this feature is coming soon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/#binding-conditions\">Binding conditions</a> improve scheduling\nreliability for certain classes of devices by allowing the Kubernetes scheduler to delay binding a pod to a node until its\nrequired external resources, such as attachable devices or FPGAs, are confirmed to be fully prepared. This prevents premature\npod assignments that could lead to failures and ensures more robust, predictable scheduling by explicitly modeling resource\nreadiness before the pod is committed to a node.</p>\n<p><em>Resource health status</em> for DRA improves observability by exposing the health status of devices allocated to a Pod via Pod Status.\nThis works whether the device is allocated through DRA or Device Plugin. This makes it easier to understand the cause of an\nunhealthy device and respond properly.\nA blog about this feature is coming soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n<p>While DRA got promoted to GA this cycle, the hard work on DRA doesn't stop. There are several features in alpha and beta that\nwe plan to bring to GA in the next couple of releases and we are looking to continue to improve performance, scalability\nand reliability of DRA. So expect an equally ambitious set of features in DRA for the 1.35 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p>A good starting point is joining the WG Device Management <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0409NGC1TK\">Slack channel</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qxI87VqGtgN7EAJlqVfxx86HGKEAc2A3SKru8nJHNkQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.tgg8gganowxq\">meetings</a>, which happen at US/EU and EU/APAC friendly time slots.</p>\n<p>Not all enhancement ideas are tracked as issues yet, so come talk to us if you want to help or have some ideas yourself!

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/29/kubernetes-v1-34-per-container-restart-policy/",
      "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>With the release of Kubernetes 1.34, a new alpha feature is introduced\nthat gives you more granular control over container restarts within a Pod. This\nfeature, named <strong>Container Restart Policy and Rules</strong>, allows you to specify a\nrestart policy for each container individually, overriding the Pod's global\nrestart policy. In addition, it also allows you to conditionally restart\nindividual containers based on their exit codes. This feature is available\nbehind the alpha feature gate <code>ContainerRestartRules</code>.</p>\n<p>This has been a long-requested feature. Let's dive into how it works and how you\ncan use it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-with-a-single-restart-policy\">The problem with a single restart policy</h2>\n<p>Before this feature, the <code>restartPolicy</code> was set at the Pod level. This meant\nthat all containers in a Pod shared the same restart policy (<code>Always</code>,\n<code>OnFailure</code>, or <code>Never</code>). While this works for many use cases, it can be\nlimiting in others.</p>\n<p>For example, consider a Pod with a main application container and an init\ncontainer that performs some initial setup. You might want the main container\nto always restart on failure, but the init container should only run once and\nnever restart. With a single Pod-level restart policy, this wasn't possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-per-container-restart-policies\">Introducing per-container restart policies</h2>\n<p>With the new <code>ContainerRestartRules</code> feature gate, you can now specify a\n<code>restartPolicy</code> for each container in your Pod's spec. You can also define\n<code>restartPolicyRules</code> to control restarts based on exit codes. This gives you\nthe fine-grained control you need to handle complex scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-cases\">Use cases</h2>\n<p>Let's look at some real-life use cases where per-container restart policies can\nbe beneficial.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-place-restarts-for-training-jobs\">In-place restarts for training jobs</h3>\n<p>In ML research, it's common to orchestrate a large number of long-running AI/ML\ntraining workloads. In these scenarios, workload failures are unavoidable. When\na workload fails with a retriable exit code, you want the container to restart\nquickly without rescheduling the entire Pod, which consumes a significant amount\nof time and resources. Restarting the failed container &quot;in-place&quot; is critical\nfor better utilization of compute resources. The container should only restart\n&quot;in-place&quot; if it failed due to a retriable error; otherwise, the container and\nPod should terminate and possibly be rescheduled.</p>\n<p>This can now be achieved with container-level <code>restartPolicyRules</code>. The workload\ncan exit with different codes to represent retriable and non-retriable errors.\nWith <code>restartPolicyRules</code>, the workload can be restarted in-place quickly, but\nonly when the error is retriable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"try-once-init-containers\">Try-once init containers</h3>\n<p>Init containers are often used to perform initialization work for the main\ncontainer, such as setting up environments and credentials. Sometimes, you want\nthe main container to always be restarted, but you don't want to retry\ninitialization if it fails.</p>\n<p>With a container-level <code>restartPolicy</code>, this is now possible. The init container\ncan be executed only once, and its failure would be considered a Pod failure. If\nthe initialization succeeds, the main container can be always restarted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pods-with-multiple-containers\">Pods with multiple containers</h3>\n<p>For Pods that run multiple containers, you might have different restart\nrequirements for each container. Some containers might have a clear definition\nof success and should only be restarted on failure. Others might need to be\nalways restarted.</p>\n<p>This is now possible with a container-level <code>restartPolicy</code>, allowing individual\ncontainers to have different restart policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-it\">How to use it</h2>\n<p>To use this new feature, you need to enable the <code>ContainerRestartRules</code> feature\ngate on your Kubernetes cluster control-plane and worker nodes running\nKubernetes 1.34+. Once enabled, you can specify the <code>restartPolicy</code> and\n<code>restartPolicyRules</code> fields in your container definitions.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-1-restarting-on-specific-exit-codes\">Example 1: Restarting on specific exit codes</h3>\n<p>In this example, the container should restart if and only if it fails with a\nretriable error, represented by exit code 42.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, the container has <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>, and a restart\npolicy rule that tells Kubernetes to restart the container in-place if it exits\nwith code 42.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Or maybe, you'd like to have custom aliases defined,\nbut not necessarily <a href=\"https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases\">generate hundreds of them manually</a>?\nLook no further. <a href=\"https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-cli/\">SIG-CLI</a>\nhas been working hard to add <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">user preferences to kubectl</a>,\nand we are happy to announce that this functionality is reaching beta as part\nof the Kubernetes v1.34 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>A full description of this functionality is available <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kuberc/\">in our official documentation</a>,\nbut this blog post will answer both of the questions from the beginning of this\narticle.</p>\n<p>Before we dive into details, let's quickly cover what the user preferences file\nlooks like and where to place it. By default, <code>kubectl</code> will look for <code>kuberc</code>\nfile in your default <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/\">kubeconfig</a>\ndirectory, which is <code>$HOME/.kube</code>. Alternatively, you can specify this location\nusing <code>--kuberc</code> option or the <code>KUBERC</code> environment variable.</p>\n<p>Just like every Kubernetes manifest, <code>kuberc</code> file will start with an <code>apiVersion</code>\nand <code>kind</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>kubectl.config.k8s.io/v1beta1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Preference<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># the user preferences will follow here</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"defaults\">Defaults</h3>\n<p>Let's start by setting default values for <code>kubectl</code> command options. Our goal\nis to always use interactive delete, which means we want the <code>--interactive</code>\noption for <code>kubectl delete</code> to always be set to <code>true</code>. This can be achieved\nwith the following addition to our <code>kuberc</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">defaults</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>delete<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">options</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>interactive<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"true\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above example, I'm introducing <code>defaults</code> section, which allows users to\ndefine default values for <code>kubectl</code> options. In this case, we're setting the\ninteractive option for <code>kubectl delete</code> to be <code>true</code> by default. This default\ncan be overridden if a user explicitly provides a different value such as\n<code>kubectl delete --interactive=false</code>, in which case the explicit option takes\nprecedence.</p>\n<p>Another highly encouraged default from SIG-CLI, is using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">Server-Side Apply</a>.\nTo do so, you can add the following snippet to your preferences:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># continuing defaults section</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>apply<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">options</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>server-side<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"true\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"aliases\">Aliases</h3>\n<p>The ability to define aliases allows us to save precious seconds when typing\ncommands. I bet that you most likely have one defined for <code>kubectl</code>, because\ntyping seven letters is definitely longer than just pressing <code>k</code>.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the ability to define aliases was a must-have when we decided\nto implement user preferences, alongside defaulting. To define an alias for any\nof the built-in commands, expand your <code>kuberc</code> file with the following addition:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">aliases</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gns<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>get<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">prependArgs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- namespace<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">options</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>output<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>json<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>There's a lot going on above, so let me break this down.

      "summary": "<p>Picture this: You're working on the Chromium project and you need to clone the repository. You run <code>git clone</code>, grab a coffee, check your email, maybe take a lunch break, and 95 minutes later, you finally have your working directory. This is the reality for developers working with large repositories containing 50GB+ of data.</p>\n<p>The productivity impact is staggering. CI/CD pipelines grind to a halt waiting for repository clones. Infrastructure costs skyrocket as compute resources sit idle. Developer frustration mounts as context-switching becomes the norm.</p>\n<p>But what if that 95-minute wait could be reduced to just 6 minutes? What if you could achieve a 93% reduction in clone times using proven techniques?</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-accelerates-embedded/misc/git-much-faster\">Git Much Faster</a> — a comprehensive benchmarking and optimization script that transforms how you work with large Git repositories. Built from real-world experience optimizing embedded development workflows, this script provides practical strategies delivering measurable performance improvements across standard git clones, optimized configurations, and Git's built-in Scalar tool.</p>\n<p>You'll discover how to dramatically reduce git clone times using optimization strategies, explore real-world performance benchmarks from major repositories like the Linux kernel and Chromium, and understand how to implement these optimizations safely in both development and CI/CD environments.</p>\n<h2>Project overview: What is Git Much Faster?</h2>\n<p>Git Much Faster is a script I wrote as an enablement tool to allow you to benchmark multiple clone optimization approaches on the same client — whether that is a traditional developer workstation, CI, cloud-hosted development environments or specialized clones for GitOps. It also contains the curated configuration settings for the fastest clone optimization. You can use these settings as a starting point and adapt or remove configurations that create too lean of a clone for your client's intended use of the repository clone.</p>\n<p>Git Much Faster addresses a fundamental challenge: Git's default clone behavior prioritizes safety over speed. While this works for small repositories, it becomes a significant bottleneck with large codebases, extensive binary assets, or complex monorepo structures.</p>\n<p>The problem manifests across increasingly common scenarios. Embedded development teams inherit repositories filled with legacy firmware binaries, bootloaders, and vendor SDKs stored directly in version control. Web applications accumulate years of marketing assets and design files. Game development projects contain massive 3D models and audio files growing repository sizes into tens of gigabytes.</p>\n<p>Enterprise CI/CD pipelines suffer particularly acute pain. Each job requires a fresh repository clone, and when operations take 20 to 90 minutes, entire development workflows grind to a halt. Infrastructure costs multiply as compute resources remain idle during lengthy clone operations.</p>\n<p>Git Much Faster solves this through comprehensive benchmarking comparing four distinct strategies: standard git clone (baseline with full history), optimized git clone (custom configurations with compression disabled and sparse checkout), Git's Scalar clone (integrated partial cloning), and current directory assessment (analyzing existing repositories without re-cloning).</p>\n<p>The tool provides measurable, repeatable benchmarking in controlled AWS environments, eliminating variables that make performance testing unreliable. The real power of Git Much Faster is to run all the benchmarks in whatever your target environment looks like — so if slow network connections are a reality for some developers, you can decipher the best clone optimization for their situation.</p>\n<h2>Technical deep dive: The optimization strategies</h2>\n<p>Understanding Git Much Faster's effectiveness requires examining specific configurations that address Git's performance bottlenecks through a layered approach tackling network transfer efficiency, CPU utilization, and storage patterns.</p>\n<p>The most significant gains come from two key settings: <code>core.compression=0</code> eliminates CPU-intensive compression during network operations,\nwhile <code>counterintuitive—surely</code> compresses data transfers faster. CPU cycles spent compressing often exceed bandwidth savings on modern high-speed networks. This optimization alone reduces clone times by 40% to 60%.</p>\n<p>The second major optimization, <code>http.postBuffer=1024M</code>, addresses Git's conservative HTTP buffer sizing. Large repositories benefit tremendously from increased buffer sizes, allowing Git to handle larger operations without breaking them into multiple requests, reducing protocol overhead.</p>\n<p>Git Much Faster leverages shallow clones using <code>--depth=1</code> (fetching only the latest commit) and partial clones with <code>--filter=blob:none</code> (deferring file content downloads until checkout). Shallow clones reduce data by 70%-90% for mature repositories, while partial clones prove particularly effective for repositories with large binary assets.</p>\n<p>Sparse checkout provides surgical precision in controlling checked-out files. Git Much Faster implements comprehensive exclusion covering 50+ binary file types — images, documents, archives, media files, and executables — reducing working directory size by up to 78% while maintaining full source code access.</p>\n<p>Git's Scalar tool, integrated into Git since Version 2.38, combines partial clone, sparse checkout, and background maintenance. However, benchmarking reveals Scalar doesn't implement the aggressive compression and buffer optimizations providing the most significant performance gains. Testing shows the custom optimized approach typically outperforms Scalar by 48%-67% while achieving similar disk space savings.</p>\n<h2>End-to-end load reduction</h2>\n<p>An interesting thing about optimizing the clone operation is that it also reduces complete system loading because you are reducing the size of your request. GitLab has a specialized, horizontal scaling layer known as <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/praefect/\">Gitaly Cluster</a>. When full history clones and large monorepos are the norm, the sizing of Gitaly Cluster is driven higher. This is because all git clone requests are serviced by a server-side binary to create “pack files” to be sent over the wire. Since these server-side git operations involve running compression utilities, it drives all three of memory, CPU, and I/O requirements at once.</p>\n<p>When git clone operations are optimized to reduce the size of the total content ask, it reduces load on the end-to-end stack: Client, Network, Gitaly Service and Storage. All layers speed up and become cheaper at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Real-world performance results</h2>\n<p>Git Much Faster's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous benchmarking across diverse, real-world repositories using consistent AWS infrastructure with Arm instances and controlled network conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Linux kernel repository (7.5GB total):</strong> Standard clone took 6 minutes 29 seconds. Optimized clone achieved 46.28 seconds — an 88.1% improvement, reducing the .git directory from 5.9GB to 284MB. Scalar took 2 minutes 21 seconds (63.7% improvement), completing 67.3% slower than the optimized approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Chromium repository (60.9GB total):</strong> Standard clone required 95 minutes 12 seconds. Optimized clone achieved 6 minutes 41 seconds — a dramatic 93% improvement, compressing the .git directory from 55.7GB to 850MB. Scalar took 13 minutes 3 seconds (86.3% improvement) but remained 48.8% slower than the optimized approach.</p>\n<p><strong>GitLab website repository (8.9GB total):</strong> Standard clone took 6 minutes 23 seconds. Optimized clone achieved 6.49 seconds — a remarkable 98.3% improvement, reducing the .git directory to 37MB. Scalar took 33.60 seconds (91.2% improvement) while remaining 80.7% slower.</p>\n<p>The benchmarking reveals clear patterns: Larger repositories show more dramatic improvements, binary-heavy repositories benefit most from sparse checkout filtering, and the custom optimization approach consistently outperforms both standard Git and Scalar across all repository types.</p>\n<h2>Practical implementation guide</h2>\n<p>Implementation requires understanding when to apply each technique based on use case and risk tolerance. For development requiring full repository access, use standard Git cloning. For read-heavy workflows needing rapid access to current code, deploy optimized cloning. For CI/CD pipelines where speed is paramount, optimized cloning provides maximum benefit.</p>\n<p>Getting started requires only simple download and execution:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">curl -L https://gitlab.com/gitlab-accelerates-embedded/misc/git-much-faster/-/raw/master/git-much-faster.sh -o ./git-much-faster.sh\n\n# For benchmarking\nbash ./git-much-faster.sh --methods=optimized,standard --repo=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>For production-grade testing, Git Much Faster includes complete Terraform infrastructure for AWS deployment, eliminating variables that skew local testing results.</p>\n<p>Optimized clones require careful consideration of limitations. Shallow clones prevent access to historical commits, limiting operations like <code>git log</code> across file history. For teams adopting optimizations it is best to create specific optimizations for high volume usage. For instance, developers can perform an optimized clone, and if and when needed, convert to full clones when needed via <code>git fetch --unshallow</code>. If a given CI job accesses commit history (e.g. using GitVersion), then you may need the full history, but not a checkout.</p>\n<h2>Use cases and industry applications</h2>\n<p>Embedded development presents unique challenges where projects historically stored compiled firmware and hardware design files directly in version control. These repositories often contain FPGA bitstreams, PCB layouts, and vendor SDK distributions ballooning sizes into tens of gigabytes. Build processes frequently require cloning dozens of external repositories, multiplying performance impact.</p>\n<p>Enterprise monorepos encounter Git performance challenges as repositories grow encompassing multiple projects and accumulated historical data. Media and asset-heavy projects compound challenges, as mentioned above — web applications accumulate marketing assets over years, while game development faces severe challenges with 3D models and audio files pushing repositories beyond 100GB.</p>\n<p>CI/CD pipelines represent the most impactful application. Each container-based CI job requires a fresh repository clone, and when operations consume 20 to 90 minutes, entire development workflows become unviable.</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>Git clone optimization represents a transformative opportunity delivering measurable improvements — up to 93% reduction in clone times and 98% reduction in disk space usage — that fundamentally change how teams interact with codebases.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that Git's default conservative approach leaves substantial performance opportunities untapped. By understanding specific bottlenecks — network transfer inefficiency, CPU-intensive compression, unnecessary data downloads — teams can implement targeted optimizations delivering transformative results.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to revolutionize your Git workflows?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-accelerates-embedded/misc/git-much-faster\">Clone the Git Much Faster repository</a> and run benchmarks against your largest repositories. Begin with read-only optimization in CI/CD pipelines where benefits are immediate and risks minimal. As your team gains confidence, gradually expand optimization to development workflows based on measured results.</p>\n<p>The future of Git performance optimization continues evolving, but fundamental principles — eliminating unnecessary work, optimizing for actual bottlenecks, measuring results rigorously — remain valuable regardless of future tooling evolution. Teams mastering these concepts today position themselves to leverage whatever improvements tomorrow's Git ecosystem provides.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Retailers often find application security challenging — in large part because the <strong>attack surface is broader than ever</strong> due to the complexity of modern commerce. From mobile apps and AI-powered personalization to omni-channel platforms and in-store IoT, every touchpoint increases the number of systems that must be secured and monitored. A single vulnerability doesn’t just affect one component, it can cascade across payment processors, inventory systems, customer data, and ultimately, brand trust.</p>\n<p>Traditional security approaches that once worked in simpler retail environments now struggle to keep up. Security processes are often bolted on as an afterthought, slowing teams down and increasing risk. But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern platforms embed security throughout the development lifecycle,</strong> making protection a seamless part of the developer workflow, not a barrier to delivery. This approach turns security into a strategic advantage, enabling innovation without compromising resilience.</p>\n<p>In this article, you'll discover how an integrated DevSecOps platform helps retail teams meet rising security demands <strong>without slowing down delivery or compromising customer experience</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Why retail security demands a different approach</h2>\n<p>In retail, security is about more than protecting data — it’s about protecting the customer experience that drives revenue. Any slowdown, outage, or vulnerability can lead to lost sales and broken trust. Retail platforms must stay online, meet compliance standards, and defend against nonstop attacks from the open internet. Unlike enterprise systems, they’re fully public-facing, with a much broader attack surface. Add in third-party integrations, APIs, and legacy systems, and it’s clear: traditional security approaches aren’t enough.</p>\n<p>Adding to the complexity, retailers face a unique set of challenges that further increase their security risks, including:</p>\n<h3>Supply chain fragility and API sprawl</h3>\n<p>Shipping delays, global instability, and interconnected systems disrupt logistics. Nearly half of retailers report product availability issues, and 25% lack real-time inventory visibility, according to a <a href=\"https://premierconstructionnews.com/2024/05/25/retails-revival-fluent-commerce-study-finds-93-of-uk-retailers-expect-business-growth-over-next-year-despite-economic-challenges-and-supply-chain-disruption/\">2024 Fluent Commerce survey</a>. While AI-powered forecasting helps, insecure APIs and fragile integrations across the digital supply chain create attack vectors.</p>\n<h3>Legacy systems meet modern demands</h3>\n<p>Many retailers operate on monolithic, outdated systems that struggle to support mobile apps, IoT devices, and real-time analytics securely. Without secure, agile foundations, each new digital touchpoint becomes a potential vulnerability.</p>\n<h3>AI and compliance complexity</h3>\n<p>AI reshapes retail experiences through personalized recommendations and advanced customer tracking technologies like beacon sensors, facial recognition, and mobile app location services that monitor movement and behavior within physical stores. These AI-powered systems enhance both customer experiences and demand forecasting capabilities for retailers. However, <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\">GDPR</a> (the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation) and similar global privacy laws require secure data handling and transparent AI logic. Security missteps can result in significant fines and lasting reputational damage.</p>\n<h3>Customer-facing automation risks</h3>\n<p>Self-checkouts, kiosks, and chatbots promise convenience and cost savings but often lack security hardening. These touchpoints become entry points for cyber attackers and enable traditional theft through weak fraud detection, limited monitoring, and easily manipulated systems that make shoplifting harder to detect.</p>\n<h3>Disparate threat surfaces</h3>\n<p>Retailers are in a unique position where they must secure across multiple vectors, often maintained by globally distributed teams (depending on the size of the organization). E-commerce platforms, mobile applications, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and in-store IoT devices all provide an entry point for threat actors with unique characteristics requiring different security solutions to ensure resiliency.</p>\n<p>This creates a unique paradox: Retailers must innovate faster than ever while maintaining higher security standards than most industries, all while delivering seamless customer experiences across every channel.</p>\n<h2>Why traditional AppSec falls short in retail</h2>\n<p>Most retailers rely on disconnected security tools such as static application security testing (SAST) scanners, license checkers, and vulnerability assessments that work in isolation. This fragmented approach creates critical gaps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Limited lifecycle coverage:</strong> Tools focus on narrow development phases, missing supply chain and runtime risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integration challenges:</strong> Legacy system gaps and poor tool connectivity create security blind spots between teams and solutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Manual processes:</strong> Security handoffs create bottlenecks, and issues are often discovered late, when they’re more costly to fix.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Team silos:</strong> Security remains isolated from daily development workflows and separate from compliance and IT teams.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The path forward</h3>\n<p>In today’s fast-paced retail landscape, security can’t slow down innovation. Embedding it directly into the development lifecycle and bringing every team together on a single unified DevSecOps platform makes security a strategic advantage rather than a bottleneck.</p>\n<h3>A DevSecOps platform enables secure innovation at scale</h3>\n<p>GitLab provides the most comprehensive set of security scanners to maximize application coverage, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/\">SAST</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dast/\">DAST</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/dependency_scanning_sbom/\">Dependency scanning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/container_scanning/\">Container scanning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/secret_detection/\">Secret detection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/iac_scanning/\">Infrastructure-as-code scanning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/api_fuzzing/\">Fuzz testing</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But security isn’t just about scanning. It's about <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_frameworks/\">enforcing the right policies</a> to ensure vulnerabilities are identified and remediated consistently. With GitLab, security teams get full control to ensure the right scan is run on the right application, at the right time, and that the findings are addressed before they reach production.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Security scans in pipeline\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1756988740/x2dteagn1z8tjfahmobv.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Security scans run in the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring immediate feedback on potential vulnerabilities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Vulnerability Report shows all vulnerabilities for a specific project or group.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1756988740/npsgvu5e0sd2kpoxug7f.png\" /></p>\n<p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vulnerability Report shows all vulnerabilities for a specific project or group.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</p>\n<h3>One platform for Dev, Sec, and Ops</h3>\n<p>Retail teams waste countless hours switching between tools, manually transferring data, losing information between systems due to fragile integrations, and reconciling conflicting reports. A unified platform eliminates this friction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single source of truth</strong> for source code, pipelines, vulnerabilities, and compliance</li>\n<li><strong>No integration overhead</strong> or tool compatibility issues</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent workflows</strong> across all teams and projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result?

      "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a> (available now in Beta) provides a framework for AI agents to interact with GitLab resources like issues and merge requests, enabling complex, multistep tasks from concept to completion. Agent Platform offers conversational (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-chat-gets-agentic-ai-makeover/\">agentic chat</a>) and automated (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-3-expanding-ai-orchestration-in-software-engineering/\">agent Flows</a>) experiences to assist with code generation, modernization, security vulnerability resolution, and project analysis — all while providing enterprise-grade security and customizable controls.</p>\n<p>&quot;Issue to MR&quot; is an agent Flow that streamlines turning a well-scoped issue into a draft merge request (MR). The Flow analyzes an issue’s description and requirements, opens a draft MR linked to the issue, creates a development plan, and proposes an implementation — right from the GitLab UI.</p>\n<h2>The developer challenge</h2>\n<p>Product tweaks such as rearranging a UI layout, adjusting component sizing, or making a minor workflow change shouldn't require hours of setup work. Yet developers find themselves caught in a frustrating cycle: hunting through codebases to locate the right files, creating branches, piecing together scattered changes across multiple components, and navigating complex review processes. And this is all before they can even see if their solution works. Development overhead transforms what should be quick iterations into time-consuming tasks, slowing down feedback loops and making simple product improvements feel like major undertakings.</p>\n<h2>How to use the Issue to MR Flow to accelerate an application update</h2>\n<p>You first need to fulfill these prerequisites before using the Issue to MR Flow.</p>\n<p>Prerequisites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An existing issue with clear requirements and acceptance criteria. This will help GitLab Duo Agent Platform better understand what you're trying to achieve and improve the quality of your output.</li>\n<li>Project access at Developer or higher permissions as the Flow will be making edits to your project's source code.</li>\n<li>GitLab Duo Agent Platform enabled for your group or project, with Flows allowed. For this, go to your project’s <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; GitLab Duo &gt; Allow flow execution</strong> toggle and enable it. GitLab is committed to helping provide guardrails, so agentic AI features require turning on these toggles to protect sensitive projects and ensure only the projects you want are accessible to GitLab Duo Agent Platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have fulfilled all the prerequisites above, you can follow these steps to take advantage of the Issue to MR Flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a project issue that describes what you’d like GitLab Duo Agent Platform to accomplish for you. Provide as much detail as possible in the issue description. If the issue already exists, open it by going to <strong>Plan &gt; Issues</strong> and clicking on the issue describing the update you want. Keep the issue well-scoped and specific.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Below the issue header, click on <strong>Generate MR with Duo</strong> to kick off the Flow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’d like to track the progress of the agents working on implementing your issue, go to <strong>Automate &gt; Agent sessions</strong> to see the live session log as agents plan and propose changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When the pipeline completes, a link to the MR appears in the issue’s activity. Open it to review the summary and file-level changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’d like to validate the proposed updates by GitLab Duo Agent Platform locally, you can pull the branch on your laptop, build and run your app, and verify that the update behaves as expected. If needed, make edits in the MR and proceed with normal review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’re happy with all the proposed application updates, merge the MR to the main branch.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Why the Issue to MR Flow works well for application changes</h2>\n<p>The Issue to MR Flow proposes code changes and updates the MR directly, so you spend less time locating files and only have to evaluate and review the result. In addition, the MR is automatically linked to the originating issue, keeping context tight for reviewers and stakeholders. Finally, you can monitor the agent session to understand what’s happening at each step.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of GitLab Duo Agent Platform</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agent Platform is <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-public-beta/\">an agentic orchestration layer</a> that brings <strong>full project context</strong>, including planning to coding, building, securing, deploying, and monitoring, so agents can help across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), not just code editing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Unified data model: GitLab Duo Agents operate on GitLab’s unified SDLC data, enabling higher-quality decisions and collaboration across tasks — including non-coding ones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security and compliance are built-in: GitLab Duo Agents run within enterprise guardrails and are usable even in highly-regulated or offline/air-gapped environments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interoperability and extensibility: Orchestrate flows across vendors and tools; connect external data via <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ai/model-context-protocol/\">MCP</a>/A2A for richer context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scale collaboration: GitLab Duo Agents work in the GitLab UI and IDEs, enabling many-to-many human-agent collaboration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Discoverable and shareable: Find and share agents and Flows in a centralized AI Catalog.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try the Issue to MR Flow today</h2>\n<p>For application updates, like a modest UI adjustment, the Issue to MR Flow helps you move from a clear issue to a reviewable MR quickly, with progress you can monitor and changes you can validate and merge through your standard workflow. It keeps context, reduces handoffs, and lets your team focus on quality rather than busywork.</p>\n<p>Watch the Issue to MR Flow in action:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrrMHN4gXF4?si=J7beTgWOLxvS4hOw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Try the Issue to MR Flow on GitLab Duo Agent Platform now with a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">free trial of GitLab Ultimate with Duo Enterprise</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

What happens when vendor priorities shift away from your critical requirements?</p>\n<p>Last month, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-3-expanding-ai-orchestration-in-software-engineering/\">we announced GitLab 18.3</a>, the latest release of our AI-native DevSecOps platform. Agent Insights, part of GitLab Duo Agent Platform, provides visibility into agent decision-making processes. Expanded AI model support means no vendor lock-in. Enhanced governance controls help enable compliance across multiple jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>These aren't just features. They're demonstrations of the transparency, independence, and developer-first approach that defines GitLab. Here's how this strategy translates into practice.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1115249475?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Who is GitLab_Robin_090225_FINAL&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>AI transparency across the DevSecOps lifecycle</h2>\n<p><strong>At GitLab, our decade-long commitment to transparency directly addresses these concerns.</strong> As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into development workflows, organizations are rightfully concerned about how their code and data are being used for AI training.</p>\n<p>The GitLab <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/ai-transparency-center/\">AI Transparency Center</a>, launched in April 2024, provides clear documentation of our data governance practices, privacy protections, and ethical AI principles. Unlike platforms that may operate AI features with unclear data usage policies, GitLab prioritizes transparency so that customers  can understand <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/data_usage/\">exactly how their data is processed</a>, stored, and protected — with no training on that data.</p>\n<p>Our approach extends to model flexibility and vendor independence. While some platforms lock customers into single, large language model (LLM) providers, creating additional vendor dependencies and potential single points of failure, GitLab's AI features are powered by a variety of models. This approach enables us to support a wide range of use cases, providing customers with the flexibility to align with their strategic priorities.</p>\n<p>As we further develop GitLab Duo Agent Platform, we remain focused on data control and maintaining comprehensive human-in-the-loop controls. And GitLab Duo Self-Hosted provides complete data sovereignty with air-gapped deployment options, zero-day data retention policies, and the ability to process all AI requests within your own infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Since May 2024, we've also maintained an <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ai/continuity-plan/\">AI continuity plan</a> with an industry-leading commitment: the ability to evaluate and move to a new model within 30 days if a provider changes its practices regarding customer data. This proactive approach to AI vendor risk management reflects our dedication to customer control.</p>\n<h2>Choice in deployment, choice in cloud provider</h2>\n<p><strong>You should be able to choose how and where to deploy your DevSecOps environment.</strong> GitLab provides genuine deployment flexibility. Organizations can choose from on-premises installations, multi-tenant SaaS, or GitLab Dedicated, our fully managed single-tenant SaaS solution, without sacrificing functionality or facing artificial restrictions designed to drive ecosystem lock-in. GitLab is also cloud-neutral, allowing customers to use the cloud provider that best suits their business needs and environment.</p>\n<p>This flexibility proves invaluable when navigating complex jurisdictional requirements and regulatory challenges. When new data localization laws emerge — as we've seen across the European Union and other regions — organizations using GitLab can rapidly adapt their deployment strategies without being constrained by ecosystem dependencies.</p>\n<p>From a procurement and risk management perspective, platform independence also provides crucial leverage in contract negotiations. Organizations aren't forced into restrictive licensing agreements that prioritize vendor interests over customer needs. This independence becomes particularly critical as enterprises become more vigilant about who controls their AI stack.</p>\n<h2>Security and compliance: Built-in and always a priority</h2>\n<p><strong>Security and compliance are now equally important to development features and should be built into the platform, not retrofitted as an afterthought.</strong> GitLab's single platform approach provides significant advantages over fragmented platforms that rely on third-party add-ins to match basic security and governance features. This architectural difference has significant implications for possible legal risk, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance. Each additional tool in the chain represents another potential point of failure, another set of terms and conditions to negotiate, and another source of risk.</p>\n<p>GitLab provides comprehensive built-in security and compliance capabilities, including custom compliance frameworks, dynamic application security testing (DAST), API fuzz testing, coverage-guided fuzzing, and infrastructure-as-code testing. These capabilities are natively integrated into the platform, offering consistent policy enforcement and reducing the compliance complexity and additional costs that come with managing multiple third-party tools.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_center/\">compliance center</a> provides a central location for teams to manage their compliance standards, adherence reporting, violations reporting, and compliance frameworks for their group. This unified approach to compliance management is particularly valuable for organizations operating in highly-regulated industries where audit trails and compliance documentation are critical.</p>\n<h2>Staying close to our open source community</h2>\n<p><strong>The best tools are shaped by the people who use them.</strong> Our commitment to open source and engagement with our community has been core to GitLab since our founding. For instance, our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/community/co-create/\">Co-Create program</a> is a collaborative initiative that enables customers to work directly with GitLab engineers to contribute features, fixes, and enhancements to the GitLab platform.</p>\n<p>Our transparency value remains fundamental to our business. An example of this is our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues\">open issue tracker</a>, where customers can follow our progress and engage directly with the GitLab team in discussions about ways we can improve our product. We recently launched our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/inside-gitlabs-healthy-backlog-initiative/\">Healthy Backlog Initiative</a> to give customers even greater visibility into our planning and direct their feedback to places with the greatest impact.</p>\n<p>Our approach enables organizations to contribute to and benefit from open source innovation while maintaining the governance, audit trails, and security controls required for regulated environments.</p>\n<h2>Data governance: Your data, your control</h2>\n<p><strong>You maintain complete control over your data and how it's processed.</strong> Data governance has become an increasingly critical factor in enterprise technology decisions, driven by a complex web of national and regional data protection laws and growing concern about control over sensitive intellectual property — like source code, customer insights, strategic initiatives, and competitive intelligence.</p>\n<p>With GitLab, you can manage who has access to AI-powered capabilities within the platform, extending beyond simple access controls to encompass encryption standards and audit capabilities aligned to regulatory frameworks. Also, customers' code and data are never used to train AI models.</p>\n<h2>The choice is clear</h2>\n<p>GitLab continues to lead in AI-native DevSecOps platform innovation – our recent <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-3-expanding-ai-orchestration-in-software-engineering/\">18.3 release</a> demonstrates this – while staying true to the independence and transparency commitments that have always guided us.</p>\n<p>Customers have a choice and it's clear: retaining control vs. vendor lock-in; transparency vs. uncertainty; dedication to innovation vs. whims of the larger ecosystem.</p>\n<p>GitLab provides the foundation for sustainable digital transformation that balances innovation with independence, helping you achieve business value for your customers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">Try GitLab Ultimate with GitLab Duo for free today.</a></p>",

      "summary": "<p>Ever find yourself switching between tabs in GitLab just to keep track of\nwhat’s happening in your project? Maybe you’re checking on an issue, then\njumping to a merge request, then over to an epic to see how everything\nconnects. Before you know it, you’ve got a browser full of tabs and you’ve\nlost your train of thought.</p>\n<p>If that sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone. So many teams waste time and energy flipping through various items in their project management software, just trying to get a handle on their work.</p>\n<p>That's why we created <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/#embedded-views\">embedded views</a>, powered by <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/\">GitLab Query Language (GLQL)</a>. With embedded views, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/08/21/gitlab-18-3-released/\">available in 18.3</a>, you get live, relevant information right where you’re already working in GitLab. No more endless context switching. No more outdated reports. Just the info you need, right when you need it.</p>\n<h2>Why embedded views matter</h2>\n<p>Embedded views are more than just a new feature, they're a fundamental shift in how teams understand and track their work within GitLab. With embedded views, teams can maintain context while accessing real-time information, creating shared understanding, and improving collaboration without ever leaving their current workflow. It’s about making work tracking feel natural and effortless, so you can focus on what matters.</p>\n<h2>How it works: Real-time data right where you need it the most</h2>\n<p>Embedded views let you insert live GLQL queries in Markdown code blocks throughout wiki pages, epics, issues, and merge requests. Here's what makes them so useful:</p>\n<h3>Always up to date</h3>\n<p>GLQL queries are dynamic, pulling fresh data each time the page loads, so your embedded views always reflect the current state of your work, not the state when you embedded the view. When changes happen to issues, merge requests, or milestones, a page refresh will show those updates in your embedded view.</p>\n<h3>Contextual awareness</h3>\n<p>Use functions like <code>currentUser()</code> and <code>today()</code> to make queries context-specific. Your embedded views automatically adapt to show relevant information for whoever is viewing them, creating personalized experiences without manual configuration.</p>\n<h3>Powerful filtering</h3>\n<p>Filter by fields like assignee, author, label, milestone, health status, creation date, and more. Use logical expressions to get exactly the data you want. We support more than 30 fields as of 18.3.</p>\n<h3>Customizable display</h3>\n<p>You can display your data as a table, a list, or a numbered list. Choose which fields to show, set a limit on the number of items, and specify the sort order to keep your view focused and actionable.</p>\n<h3>Availability</h3>\n<p>You can use embedded views in group and project wikis, epic and issue descriptions, merge requests, and comments. GLQL is available across all GitLab tiers: Free, Premium, and Ultimate, on GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated. Certain functionality, such as displaying epics, status, custom fields, iterations, and weights, is available in the Premium and Ultimate tiers. Displaying health status is available only in Ultimate.</p>\n<h2>See embedded views in action</h2>\n<p>The syntax of an embedded view's source is a superset of YAML that consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>query</code> parameter: Expressions joined together with a logical operator, such as <code>and</code>.</li>\n<li>Parameters related to the presentation layer, like <code>display</code>, <code>limit</code>, or <code>fields</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>description</code>\nrepresented as YAML.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A view is defined in Markdown as a code block, similar to other code blocks like Mermaid.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Display a table of first 5 open issues assigned to the authenticated user in <code>gitlab-org/gitlab</code>.\nDisplay columns <code>title</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>health</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>epic</code>, <code>milestone</code>, <code>weight</code>, and <code>updated</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">```glql\ndisplay: table\ntitle: GLQL table 🎉\ndescription: This view lists my open issues\nfields: title, state, health, epic, milestone, weight, updated\nlimit: 5\nquery: project = &quot;gitlab-org/gitlab&quot; AND assignee = currentUser() AND state = opened\n```\n</code></pre>\n<p>This source should render a table like the one below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755193172/ibzfopvpztpglnccwrjj.png\" /></p>\n<p>An easy way to create your first embedded view is to navigate to the <strong>More options</strong> dropdown in the rich text editor toolbar. Once in this toolbar, select <strong>Embedded view</strong>, which populates the following query in a Markdown code block:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">```glql\nquery: assignee = currentUser()\nfields: title, createdAt, milestone, assignee\ntitle: Issues assigned to current user\n```\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save your changes to the comment or description where the code block appears, and you're done! You've successfully created your first embedded view!</p>\n<h2>How GitLab uses embedded views</h2>\n<p>Whether tracking merge requests targeting security releases, triaging bugs to improve backlog hygiene, or managing team onboarding and milestone planning, we rely on embedded views for mission-critical processes every day. This isn't just a feature we built, it's a tool we depend on to run our business effectively. When you adopt embedded views, you're getting a tested solution that's already helping GitLab teams work more efficiently, make data-driven decisions, and maintain visibility across complex workflows. Simply stated, embedded views can transform how your team accesses and analyzes the work that matters most to your success.</p>\n<p>To learn and see more about how GitLab is using embedded views internally, check out <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-gitlab-measures-red-team-impact-the-adoption-rate-metric/\">How GitLab measures Red Team impact: The adoption rate metric</a>, and Global Search Release Planning issues for the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/search-team/team-tasks/-/issues/239\">18.1</a>, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/search-team/team-tasks/-/issues/241\">18.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/search-team/team-tasks/-/issues/245\">18.3</a> milestones.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>Embedded views are just the start of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/knowledge/\">Knowledge Group's</a> vision for work tracking. Learn more about what we're focusing on next in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15249\">embedded views post-GA epic</a>.

Building on that foundation, we're on a journey toward becoming the world's first AI-native platform for software engineering. At GitLab, we believe the future of software engineering is an inherently human and AI collaboration, and we want to bring the very best AI capabilities to every GitLab user.</p>\n<p>This transformation is happening at three distinct layers that go beyond what other AI dev tools are doing:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"AI-native transformation slide visualizing what's laid out below\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755762266/iwuugge3cxweiyvi0yjk.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>First, we are a system of record.</strong> Our unified data platform holds your most valuable digital assets. This includes your source code and intellectual property, as well as a wealth of unstructured data spanning project plans, bug backlogs, CI/CD configurations, deployment histories, security reports, and compliance data. This creates a treasure trove of contextual data that remains securely within your GitLab environment, unavailable to generic agents or large language models.</p>\n<p><strong>Second, we act as your software control plane.</strong> We orchestrate your most critical business processes through Git repositories, REST APIs, and webhook-based interfaces that power your end-to-end software delivery. Many of our customers consider this a tier-0 dependency that their critical business processes rely on daily.</p>\n<p><strong>Third, we deliver a powerful user experience.</strong> We deliver an integrated interface that helps eliminate the costly context-switching that slows down most engineering teams. With complete lifecycle visibility and collaboration tools in one platform, over 50 million registered users and our vast community depend on GitLab to get their work done. This expertise positions GitLab uniquely to pioneer intuitive human-to-AI collaboration that amplifies team productivity while preserving the workflows that our users know and trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Extending our platform with AI natively integrated at every layer</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a> integrates and extends all three of these layers. It is designed for extensibility and interoperability, enabling customers and partners to build solutions that create even more value. Our open platform approach emphasizes seamless connectivity with external AI tools and systems while being deeply integrated into our existing stack at all three layers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we're extending our unified data platform with a <strong>Knowledge Graph,</strong> which indexes and stitches together code with all of the rest of your unstructured data, specifically optimized for agentic access. AI thrives on context, and we believe this will not only accelerate reasoning and inference by agents but also deliver lower-cost and higher-quality agentic outcomes.</li>\n<li>Second, we're adding an important <strong>Orchestration Layer</strong> to our existing Control Plane in three distinct parts: enabling agents and flows to register as subscribers for GitLab SDLC events, building a new orchestration engine that allows for purpose-built, multi-agent flows, and exposing GitLab tools, agents, and flows via MCP and standard protocols for unparalleled interoperability.</li>\n<li>Finally, we're extending the <strong>GitLab experience</strong> to deliver first-class agents and agent flows across the entire software development lifecycle. You'll be able to assign async tasks to agents, @ mention them in comments, and create custom agents with context specific to your workflows — but more importantly, GitLab is shipping native agents for every stage of development while unlocking a rich ecosystem of third-party agents. This creates true human-to-AI collaboration where agents become as natural to work with as your human teammates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch this video to see what's coming in 18.3 and beyond, or read on.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111796316?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;GitLab_18.3 Release_081925_MP_v1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>What's new in GitLab 18.3</h2>\n<p>With 18.2, we introduced specialized <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-public-beta/#agents-that-work-out-of-the-box:~:text=Agents%20that%20work%20out%20of%20the%20box\">AI agents</a> that work alongside developers across the software development lifecycle, plus our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-public-beta/#agents-that-work-out-of-the-box:~:text=we%20are%20building%3A-,Software%20Development%20Flow,-(now%20in%20beta\">Software Development Flow</a> — a powerful feature that gives users the ability to orchestrate multiple agents to plan, implement, and test code changes end-to-end.</p>\n<p>GitLab 18.3 introduces expanded integrations and interoperability, more Flows, and enhanced context awareness across the entire software development lifecycle.</p>\n<h3>Expanded integrations and interoperability</h3>\n<p>We're delivering comprehensive AI extensibility through both first-party GitLab agents and a rich ecosystem of third-party agents, all with full access to project context and data. This approach maintains native GitLab workflows and governance while providing the flexibility to choose preferred tools through highly integrated orchestration between these agents and GitLab's core platform. Teams gain enhanced AI functionality while preserving key integration, oversight, and user experience benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MCP server - Universal AI integration:</strong> GitLab's MCP (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ai/model-context-protocol/\">Model Context Protocol</a>) server enables AI systems to securely integrate directly with your GitLab projects and development processes. This standardized interface eliminates custom integration overhead and allows your AI tools — including <a href=\"https://docs.cursor.com/en/tools/mcp\">Cursor</a> — to work intelligently within your existing GitLab environment. See our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_server/\">docs</a> for a full list of tools included with 18.3. <strong>This is only the start; additional tools are planned for 18.4.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Bringing GitLab workflows directly into Cursor is a critical step in reducing friction for developers. By minimizing the need for context switching, teams can check issue status, review merge requests, and monitor pipeline results without ever leaving their coding environment. This integration is a natural fit for our shared customers, and we look forward to a long-term partnership with GitLab to continue enhancing developer productivity.”</em></p>\n<p>- <strong>Ricky Doar, VP of Field Engineering at Cursor</strong></p>\n<p><em>“GitLab's MCP server and CLI agent support create powerful new ways for Amazon Q to integrate with development workflows. Amazon Q Developer can now connect directly through GitLab's remote MCP interface, while teams can delegate development tasks by simply @ mentioning Amazon Q CLI in issues and merge requests. The robust security and governance capabilities built into these integrations give enterprises the confidence to leverage AI coding tools while preserving their development standards.

This helps eliminate the manual effort and potential errors of rewriting CI configurations from scratch, enabling teams to migrate entire deployment pipelines with confidence. 18.3 includes support for Jenkins migrations. Additional support is planned for future releases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111783724?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Convert to CI Flow&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h3>Intelligent code and search</h3>\n<p>AI point solutions typically operate with limited visibility into isolated code snippets, but GitLab's Knowledge Graph provides agents with environment context to help inform faster and more intelligent responses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge Graph for real-time code intelligence:</strong> With 18.3, GitLab's Knowledge Graph now delivers real-time code indexing to enable faster code searches, delivering more accurate and contextual results. By understanding the relationships between files, dependencies, and development patterns across your entire codebase, our agents are designed to provide insights that would take human developers hours to uncover — <strong>and this is just the first step in unlocking the powerful capabilities that are planned for Knowledge Graph.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Enterprise governance</h3>\n<p>AI transparency and organizational control are critical challenges that can hold teams back from fully adopting AI-powered development tools, with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/software-innovation-report/\">85% of executives agreeing that agentic AI will create unprecedented security challenges</a>.</p>\n<p>These new features in 18.3 help address concerns around data governance, compliance requirements, and the need for visibility into AI decision-making processes so organizations can integrate AI within their existing security and policy frameworks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agent Insights for transparency through intelligence:</strong> Our built-in agent tracking provides visibility into agent decision-making processes. Users can optimize workflows and follow best practices through transparent activity tracking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111783244?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Agent Insights&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GitLab Duo Code Review for Self-Hosted:</strong> This brings the intelligence of GitLab Duo to organizations with strict data governance requirements by allowing teams to keep sensitive code in controlled environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid model configurations for flexible AI deployment:</strong> GitLab Duo Self-Hosted customers can now use hybrid model configurations, combining self-hosted AI models via their local AI gateway with GitLab's cloud models through GitLab's AI gateway, enabling access to various features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111783569?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Self Hosted Models Code Review&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced security with OAuth support:</strong> Our MCP server now includes full OAuth 2.0 authentication support, enabling secure connections to protected resources and sensitive development environments. This implementation follows the draft OAuth specification for MCP, handling authorization flows, token management, and dynamic client registration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Secure by Design platform: Governance that scales</h3>\n<p>True platform security requires consistent application of governance principles across every layer of the development lifecycle. The same security fundamentals that make AI adoption safe — least-privilege access, centralized policy management, proactive monitoring, and granular permissions — must be embedded throughout the entire SDLC to create a cohesive, defense-in-depth approach.</p>\n<p>GitLab 18.3 strengthens the foundational controls that help protect your entire software supply chain with these new updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Custom admin role:</strong> Provides granular, purpose-built administrative permissions, replacing blanket admin access with precise, least-privilege controls. Instead of granting blanket administrative privileges that create security risks, organizations can now create specialized roles tailored to specific functions — platform teams managing runners and monitoring, support teams handling user management, and leadership accessing dashboards and usage statistics. With complete role lifecycle management through UI and API, audit logging, and auto-generated documentation, this feature enables true least-privilege administration while helping maintain operational efficiency and improve overall instance security.</li>\n<li><strong>Instance-level compliance framework and security policy management</strong>: Organizations can now designate a dedicated compliance group that has the authority to apply standardized frameworks and security policies directly to top-level groups, automatically cascading enforcement to all their subgroups and projects. This centralized approach eliminates the compliance adoption blocker of fragmented policy management while maintaining group autonomy for additional local policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced violations reporting:</strong> Teams now receive immediate notifications when unauthorized changes are made to MR approval rules, framework policies lack proper approvals, or time-based compliance controls are violated. By directly linking violations to specific compliance framework controls, teams get actionable insights that tell them exactly which requirement was breached, turning compliance from a reactive checkbox exercise into a proactive, integrated part of the development and security workflow.</li>\n<li><strong>Fine-grained permissions for CI/CD job tokens:</strong> Replaces broad token access with granular, explicit permissions that grant CI/CD jobs access only to specific API endpoints they actually need. Instead of allowing jobs blanket access to project resources, teams can now define precise permissions for deployments, packages, releases, environments, and other critical resources, reducing the attack surface and potential for privilege escalation.</li>\n<li><strong>AWS Secrets Manager integration:</strong> Teams using AWS Secrets Manager can now retrieve secrets directly in GitLab CI/CD jobs, simplifying the build and deploy processes. Secrets are accessed by a GitLab Runner using OpenID Connect protocol-based authentication, masked to prevent exposure in job logs, and destroyed after use. This approach eliminates the need to store secrets in variables and integrates cleanly into existing GitLab and AWS-based workflows. Developed in close collaboration with Deutsche Bahn and the AWS Secrets Manager team, this integration reflects our commitment to building solutions alongside customers to solve real-world challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Artifact management: Securing your software supply chain</h3>\n<p>When artifacts aren't properly governed, small changes can have big consequences. Mutable packages, overwritten container images, and inconsistent rules across tools can trigger production outages, introduce vulnerabilities, and create compliance gaps. For enterprise DevSecOps, secure, centralized artifact management is essential for keeping the software supply chain intact.</p>\n<h4>Enterprise-grade artifact protection in 18.3</h4>\n<p>Building on our comprehensive package protection capabilities, GitLab 18.3 adds important new features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conan revisions support:</strong> New in 18.3, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/conan_2_repository/#conan-revisions\">Conan revisions</a> provide package immutability for C++ developers. When changes are made to a package without changing its version, Conan calculates unique identifiers to track these changes, enabling teams to maintain immutable packages while preserving version clarity.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Container Registry security:</strong> Following the successful launch of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/container_registry/immutable_container_tags/\">immutable container tags</a> in 18.2, we're seeing strong enterprise adoption. Once a tag is created that matches an immutable rule, no one — regardless of permission level — can modify that container image, preventing unintended changes to production dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These enhancements complement our existing protection capabilities for npm, PyPI, Maven, NuGet, Helm charts, and generic packages, enabling platform teams to implement consistent governance across their entire software supply chain — a requirement for organizations building secure internal developer platforms.</p>\n<p>Unlike standalone artifact solutions, GitLab's integrated approach eliminates context switching between tools while providing end-to-end traceability from code to deployment, enabling platform teams to implement consistent governance across their entire software delivery pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Embedded views: Real-time visibility and reports</h3>\n<p>As GitLab projects grow in complexity, teams find themselves navigating between issues, merge requests, epics, and milestones to maintain visibility into work status. The challenge lies in consolidating this information efficiently while ensuring teams have real-time access to project progress without context switching or breaking their flow.\n<strong>Launching real-time work status visibility in 18.3</strong>\nGitLab 18.3's <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/#embedded-views\">embedded views, powered by our powerful GitLab Query Language</a> (GLQL), eliminate context switching by bringing live project data directly into your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dynamic views:</strong> Insert live GLQL queries in Markdown code blocks throughout wiki pages, epics, issues, and merge requests that automatically refresh with current project states each time you load the page.</li>\n<li><strong>Contextual personalization:</strong> Views automatically adapt using functions like <code>currentUser()</code> and <code>today()</code> to show relevant information for whoever is viewing, without manual configuration.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful filtering:</strong> Filter by 25+ fields, including assignee, author, label, milestone, health status, and creation date.</li>\n<li><strong>Display flexibility:</strong> Present data as tables, lists, or numbered lists with customizable field selection, item limits, and sort orders to keep your views focused and actionable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike fragmented project management approaches, we've designed embedded views to maintain your workflow continuity while providing real-time visibility, enabling teams to make informed decisions without losing focus or switching between multiple tools and interfaces.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn about the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/08/21/gitlab-18-3-released/\">newest features in GitLab 18.3</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get started today</h2>\n<p>GitLab 18.3 is available now for GitLab Premium and Ultimate users on GitLab.com and self-managed environments.</p>\n<p>GitLab Dedicated customers are now upgraded to 18.2 and will be able to use the features released with GitLab 18.3 next month.</p>\n<p>Ready to experience the future of software engineering?<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/turn_on_off/#turn-on-beta-and-experimental-features\"> Enable beta and experimental features for GitLab Duo</a> and start collaborating with AI agents that understand your complete development context.</p>\n<p>New to GitLab? <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/-/trials/new\">Start your free trial</a> today and discover why the future of software engineering is human and AI collaboration, orchestrated through the world's most comprehensive DevSecOps platform.</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

With this launch, organizations can streamline user access, reduce IT overhead, and give teams a faster, more secure way to log in and start building. Single Sign-On represents a major step forward in strengthening security, simplifying user management, and empowering teams to be more productive on DigitalOcean.</p>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"why-single-sign-on-matters\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#why-single-sign-on-matters\">Why Single Sign-On matters</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#why-single-sign-on-matters\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>For growing teams, managing user accounts across multiple platforms can quickly become a challenge. Password resets, manual onboarding, and offboarding all add up, not just for the IT team–but developers feel it too in terms of lost productivity.</p>\n<p>Single Sign-On solves this by letting users sign in with their existing corporate credentials through trusted identity providers like Okta. That means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>No more juggling multiple usernames and passwords.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Centralized access management that scales with your team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No more wasting time being locked out of critical apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stronger, consistent security across your entire toolchain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-single-sign-on-can-benefit-your-business\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-single-sign-on-can-benefit-your-business\">How Single Sign-On can benefit your business</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-single-sign-on-can-benefit-your-business\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>As organizations grow, managing user access across multiple tools and platforms can become complex, time-consuming, and costly.

Remember to include human intervention when exploring MCP Server, as a safeguard. Use secure access controls, clear audit trails, and strong error handling to help keep your system reliable. A layer of human oversight helps to ensure that critical decisions aren’t left entirely to automation. As with most new technologies, regular testing, monitoring, and maintenance are ideal best practices to adopt for a successful and resilient setup.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"availability-pricing\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#availability-pricing\">Availability &amp; Pricing</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#availability-pricing\"></a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong>  <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/product-lifecycle/#public-preview\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supported</a> in production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"related-resources\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#related-resources\">Related Resources</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#related-resources\"></a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/mcp-digitalocean\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Model Context Protocol overview</a></li>\n<li>Docs coming soon</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"feedback-next-steps\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#feedback-next-steps\">Feedback &amp; Next Steps</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#feedback-next-steps\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>We’d love to hear what you build with MCP.

      "summary": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_-6V9xGQM6vGmsiD_dNEog.png\" /></figure><p>The results of the 2025 Argo CD user survey are in! We had a fantastic response, with 185 submissions, which shows the community is more engaged than ever.</p><p>This year, our goal was to capture a well-rounded view of how folks use Argo CD. We strive to stay closely connected to our users, understand where we’re excelling, and identify current pain points so we can prioritize improvements and proactively address community needs.</p><p>This year’s theme is environment promotion, as it has emerged as one of the most significant pain points currently experienced by Argo CD users.</p><p>Here’s what we learned.</p><h4>TL;DR</h4><p>Argo CD is growing fast and becoming a standard for deployments to production!</p><p>Compared to 2023, significantly more organizations rely on it in production. Over 60% of respondents have been actively using it in Production for more than 2 years. Patterns like ApplicationSets and self-healing have become widely adopted. Argo CD is increasingly being used at scale, with instances managing more applications, often spanning multiple clusters. We can expect scalability and performance to become the pressure points, as well as growing interest in enterprise-like capabilities from the community.</p><p>Environment promotion is where things start to get tricky. Most teams still lean on custom scripts or manual steps to get the job done. Many organizations seek solutions to improve traceability and visibility, and to standardize workflows across environments. We will likely see more maturity and new capabilities in this area.</p><p>We’re also seeing more applications under management overall, with organizations connecting more clusters to each Argo CD instance, yet still running just one to five instances. This trend points to growing pressure on instance scalability and performance.</p><p>A few more highlights from the results:</p><ul><li>Argo Labs projects like Argo CD Image Updater, Argo CD Operator, and Argo CD Vault Plugin are gaining traction, reflecting a push toward automation.</li><li>Helm is by far the most popular Argo CD installation method.</li><li>Platform engineers now make up a larger share of the community, reflecting broader organizational shifts.</li></ul><h4>What do developers really think of Argo CD?</h4><p>We kicked off the survey by asking users how likely they were to recommend Argo CD to others — one of the simplest ways to get a feel for overall satisfaction.</p><p>The 2025 result? Overwhelmingly positive 🎉 Even more users this year said they’d recommend Argo CD compared to an already strong showing in 2023. That shift says a lot about how far the tool has come and the growing trust the community has in it. In fact, Argo CD achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 79 — an increase of 3 points from two years ago — highlighting exceptional user satisfaction!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZY4tGNGXZGrHgLfn\" /></figure><p>We were overwhelmed by the encouraging and positive comments, reflecting just how much people love the project and deeply value the vibrant Argo community. Here’s what some users had to say:</p><blockquote><em>“Argo CD is incredible, I have no idea how we survived without it in the past.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Thanks for this great tool ❤️”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re awesome!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Please keep going!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Keep up the good work! :)”</em></blockquote><p>We asked which features users find most valuable. The winners?</p><ul><li>ApplicationSets</li><li>Argo CD’s intuitive UI</li></ul><p>Together, they make it much easier to manage and visualise complex deployments.</p><p>Also mentioned: auto-sync, drift detection, rollbacks, RBAC, multi-source support, and integrations.</p><h4>Who’s using Argo CD these days?</h4><p>The community remains consistent and is made up mostly of DevOps and platform engineers, but platform engineers have grown from 25% in 2023 to 37% in 2025. DevOps engineers declined slightly from 43% to 36%. This shift likely reflects the broader industry trend toward adopting a platform mindset, resulting in increased demand for dedicated platform engineering roles. Roles like architects and SREs remained steady.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZXUJ5osL9R28zoUn\" /></figure><h4>What does adoption look like in 2025?</h4><p>With the adoption being consistently high, 93% of respondents use Argo CD in production in 2023 and 97% in 2025, the implementation maturity grows significantly. In 2023, only 28% had used Argo CD in production for over 2 years. In 2025, that number jumped to 60%, and fewer than 10% were still evaluating or in early phases.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e0xsvHzotjrhkIYg\" /></figure><p>Almost 60% of respondents said that 75% or more of their production applications now run on Kubernetes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gWqJBdpN4BHjbFFs\" /></figure><p>As Kubernetes adoption deepens, Argo CD has become an essential part of the CI/CD infrastructure. As more organizations rely on Argo CD, we’ll likely see continued investment from both the community and vendors, as well as more contributors joining the project.</p><p>When it comes to Argo CD installation, Helm is by far the top choice, followed by tools like Kustomize and Terraform. Interesting to note: 19% use cluster-wide installs versus just 10% using namespace-scoped ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x4RJRiUclqZg-VgN\" /></figure><h4>What does the Argo CD footprint look like?</h4><p>The most noticeable trend is the growing number of applications. Organizations are managing bigger setups with fewer, larger instances.</p><p>In 2023, just over 15% managed more than 500 Applications; by 2025, this rose to 42%. Notably, these numbers don’t correlate with how long organizations have used Argo CD and how many applications they have.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eRwUqAp_3dbairfo\" /></figure><p>The number of Argo CD instances is growing compared to 2023, but the increase is not as significant as the rise in the number of applications. In 2023, 77% of respondents reported having fewer than 6 instances, while this percentage fell to 64% in 2025. Nevertheless, most organizations still use only a handful of instances.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q_ePbizmF7pE04-k\" /></figure><p>Even though the number of Argo CD instances hasn’t changed much, the number of applications certainly has! This means each instance is likely connecting to more clusters. For example, back in 2023, about 42% of instances were linked to one Kubernetes cluster. Fast forward to 2025, and that number has dropped to 25%. At the same time, the share of instances connecting to more than 20 clusters has jumped significantly, going from 5% to 25%.</p><p>In summary, organizations manage a significantly larger number of applications, with more clusters connected to a single Argo CD instance, typically keeping the number of instances between 1 and 5.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the community and the project? Well, it seems that managing lots of Argo CD instances might not be the biggest hurdle for most teams. Instead, the real pressure points are around scalability and performance as organizations push Argo CD to handle more clusters and Applications. Users are already calling out these challenges, and they’re likely to become even more important moving forward. The good news? Some of this work is already underway.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Interested in how to scale Argo CD? Take a look at the </em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-agent\"><em>argocd-agent project</em></a><em> or read an </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\"><em>article about scaling up Argo CD</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to contribute to measuring and improving Argo scalability, take a look at the Scalability special interest group (</em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/main/sigs/sig-scalability\"><em>Argo SIG Scalability</em></a><em>).</em></p><h4>What patterns and tools are catching on?</h4><p>More and more teams are following Argo CD’s recommended practices. App-of-Apps, ApplicationSets, and built-in self-healing are now widely used to manage complex GitOps setups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG5_7BB_xx5xn1U_\" /></figure><p>We also asked about sub-projects, an area that shows the ecosystem dynamics. The most used are:</p><ul><li>Argo CD Image Updater</li><li>Argo CD Operator</li><li>Argo CD Vault Plugin</li></ul><p>Like the patterns mentioned earlier, the popularity of these Argo Labs projects reflects growing efforts to make Argo CD implementations more structured and automation-friendly.</p><p><em>ℹ️ You can manage secrets with </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/secret-management/#secret-management\"><em>Kubernetes operators</em></a><em>, one of the recommended ways of managing secrets on the destination cluster. This keeps Argo CD out of direct secret management, helping avoid accidental updates and reducing the risk of leaks.</em></p><p>Image Updater is the most adopted sub-project (used by 34% of respondents). While still under active development and intended for non-critical environments, its popularity shows just how hungry teams are for better deployment and promotion automation.</p><p>But Image Updater only solves part of the deployment automation puzzle. There’s still no go-to comprehensive solution out there. We’ll explore this further in the next section on environment promotion.</p><h4>Environment promotion</h4><p>Given how widely Argo CD is used in production, we wanted to explore how teams handle environment promotion. Is it a pain point for GitOps users? And how do their approaches compare to the more traditional promotion strategies used on other platforms?</p><p>First, we looked at the number of environments teams work with. Now, most respondents use 3 or fewer. Only 12% reported having more than 8.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lwhiMHHc0r41nELe\" /></figure><p>This introduces complexity, as teams must coordinate across multiple instances. And that’s where challenges like consistent observability start to show up.</p><p>To dig deeper into this, we asked teams about their biggest pain points. What came up most?</p><ul><li>Traceability across environments, what version of a deployed app is running where (51%)</li><li>Release gates (44%)</li><li>Understanding app health and status across environments (37%)</li><li>Keeping pipeline definitions consistent (36%)</li><li>Troubleshooting failed promotions (29%)</li></ul><p>Most teams reported multiple challenges, with traceability and release gates often mentioned together.</p><p>To understand what drives these challenges, we asked how teams promote applications across environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IV4zO6ktxeE6AFz0\" /></figure><p>The most common setup is DIY. Around 67% use scripts, in-house tools, or both.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of teams handle promotions solely through manual manifest updates, and almost half use some form of manual step, often paired with scripts.</p><p>So, how can we make sense of this combination? One possibility is that teams are using Argo CD Image Updater, currently the most popular sub-project, for simple, image-only updates. For more complex tasks, like updating configuration files, many might rely on manual steps. In other words, automation helps with the easy stuff, but more involved changes still need hands-on work.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Manual manifest updates are often where teams start with Argo CD. They can work well for small setups, like a few static infrastructure manifests.</em></p><p><em>But as you scale, they tend to fall short. It’s easy to run into slower deployments, more manual overhead, and challenges around security and compliance. If you’re growing with Argo CD, it’s worth moving toward full CI/CD automation to keep things on track.</em></p><p>A few out-of-the-box solutions for automated environment promotion are starting to show up in the survey. The most mentioned, though still only used by 4% of respondents, is <a href=\"https://argo-gitops-promoter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">GitOps Promoter</a>. It’s part of the Argo CD ecosystem and works alongside <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/proposals/manifest-hydrator/\">Hydrator</a> to handle promotions via pull requests. Others mentioned Codefresh GitOps and Kargo.</p><p>Here’s how one person summed it up:</p><blockquote><em>“Some sort of environment promotion. Lots of players in the game now and it’s hard to settle on one. Lots of manual reviews required for manifest changes that can be tiresome to compare against other environments. Some sort of environment comparison tool would be good.”</em></blockquote><p>That quote really captures where things stand. Plenty is happening in this space, but no clear winner or standard approach just yet. As more teams adopt Argo CD and take on more advanced deployment setups, tackling challenges like traceability, testing, and consistent configuration will only become more important.</p><p>This is definitely a space to watch. Expect more tooling, more investment, and, hopefully, comprehensive user-friendly solutions soon.</p><h4>What challenges are teams facing?</h4><p>After digging into environment promotion, we zoomed out and asked about broader challenges, too.</p><p>Nearly 30% of respondents said they had no major challenges with Argo CD, which is a great sign.</p><p>The most common challenge, flagged by 37%, was environment modeling and promotion workflows (covered earlier).</p><p>Other pain points included:</p><ul><li>Troubleshooting deployments and app issues (25%)</li><li>Too much manual work or not enough automation (23%)</li><li>Limited visibility into deployment status (16%)</li></ul><h4>What features are missing?</h4><p>To wrap up, we asked what users think is missing from Argo CD. Many of the responses built on earlier themes.</p><p>Some areas users want to see improved:</p><ul><li>Support for promoting apps through stages and managing service dependencies.</li><li>Better templating in ApplicationSets, progressive syncs, and built-in promotion workflows.</li><li>Multi-cluster visibility and faster UI performance.</li><li>Enterprise-grade features like fine-grained RBAC, audit trails, Vault and Prometheus integrations, and better error messages.</li></ul><p>As teams scale up, these requests point toward a natural next step: evolving Argo CD into a full-featured, enterprise-ready platform.</p><h4>Final words</h4><p>The 2025 survey gave us a ton to think about. We saw just how far Argo CD has come, what’s working well, and what needs more attention. All these insights are gold for the project’s future evolution.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to share feedback!</p><p>Special shoutout to those who offered to help with case studies, blog posts, talks, or quotes. It really helps grow the community!</p><p>And thanks to Katie Lamkin-Fulsher, Dan Garfield, Henrik Blixt, Michael Crenshaw, Christian Hernandez, Regina Voloshin, Kostis Kapelonis, Jenny Blekh and Tegan Ali, who made this survey possible.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ab045f7d5d9a\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-cd-2025-user-survey-results-ab045f7d5d9a\">Argo CD 2025 User Survey Results</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With v3.1, the first batch of features comes out of the gate; featuring <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">OCI</a> support, CLI Plugins, Hydrator updates, UI improvements, plus much more.</p><p>Along with new features, this release comes with a whole slew of security fixes, bug fixes, and general quality of life improvements.</p><p>You can download the v3.1 on the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">Argo CD Releases Page</a>!</p><p>We are really excited to have you try out the new features and look forward to any feedback from the border community! With that, let’s dive into what this release holds!</p><h3>OCI Support</h3><p>Argo CD has supported obtaining Kubernetes manifests from either a Git repository, a Helm chart repository, and later support for getting manifests from a Helm chart stored within an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry. As OCI registries have more frequently been used to store content aside from container images, more and more projects have been adding support for using OCI as a storage mechanism and a source of truth.</p><p>Starting with Argo CD v3.1, we now support OCI by enabling the use of OCI-compliant container registries as sources for configuration artifacts. This means Argo CD can pull Kubernetes manifests packaged as OCI artifacts from registries that follow the OCI image and distribution specifications. This enhances security and portability, as it allows users to leverage the same registries they use for container images to also store and distribute deployment configurations. Argo CD OCI support comes into beta with this release.</p><p>BIG thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">@blakepettersson</a> from Akuity for leading this effort!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements</h3><p>Manifest changes are often just image tag bumps. For example, the manifest change associated with a code change. The manifest hydrator writes metadata to the hydrated branch to associate the hydrated commit back to its corresponding dry commit.</p><p>Starting in v3.1, the Hydrator now allows for a way to associate a dry commit with a code commit. This is done by adding information about the upstream repo url, that commit SHA hash, the author of that commit, and any messages associated with that code commit. This information is then added to the Hydrator manifest metadata; this enables future work to be able to display this metadata in the Argo CD UI.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a> from Intuit for this improvement.</p><h3>Server-Side Apply Stabilization</h3><p>Argo CD now supports client-side apply migration, which helps transitioning from client-side apply to server-side apply by moving a resource’s managed fields from one manager to Argo CD’s manager. This feature is particularly useful when you need to migrate existing resources that were created using kubectl client-side apply to server-side apply with Argo CD. You can also specify your own field manager to migrate from using an annotation. This is useful when you have other operators managing resources that are no longer in use and would like Argo CD to own all the fields for that operator.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">@pjiang-dev</a> from Intuit for this contribution.</p><h3>UI Parameterized Action</h3><p>The Argo CD UI in many ways is the first Kubernetes dashboard, providing not only a UI for GitOps users; but also a feature rich UI for Kubernetes end users. In this release, we’ve added the ability to perform additional action on Kubernetes resources, beyond just deleting.</p><p>This feature enables users to scale resources directly from the Argo CD UI. Users will be able to increase or decrease the number of replicas (Pods) for Deployments and StatefulSets by using an input field. The feature aims to enhance user experience, especially for non-technical users, by eliminating the need to modify configuration files or use kubectl commands for scaling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7C4pCbBqylNOEFKm\" /><figcaption>Scaling resource from Argo CD UI</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ratulbasak\">@ratulbasak</a> from Deutsche Bank for contributing!</p><h3>And We Didn’t Stop There</h3><p>There are other notable updates/improvements in this release.</p><ul><li>Similar to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/\">kubectl plugin mechanism</a>, support for <em>argocd</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20074\">CLI plugins</a> is available in this release. — <a href=\"https://github.com/nitishfy\">@nitishify</a></li><li>You can now <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22482\">explicitly set auto-sync</a> on an Application — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li>The sync option <em>SkipDryRunOnMissingResource</em> was only available as an annotation before; now you can set this as an Application sync option — <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">@pasha-codefresh</a></li><li>Improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22781\">AppSet Progressive Sync in the UI</a>, paving the path for it to enter Beta — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23057\">Add cooldown</a> to prevent resetting autoheal exp backoff preemptively — <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">@gdsoumya</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22864\">Added GitHub API metrics</a> to better debug rate limiting — <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a></li></ul><h3>Dependency, Platform, and Security Updates</h3><p>Some notable dependency, platform, and security updates included in v3.1</p><p><strong>Go 1.24.4</strong></p><ul><li>All builds, CI, and images now use the latest Go.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>.

Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months. If you are interested in contributing a canary step plugin to the community, simply open an issue under argo-rollouts requesting an argoproj-labs repository to host your plugin.</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a></p><h3>Analysis Consecutive Success Limit</h3><p>This provides the <em>inverse</em> of what an analysis currently does.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

#56587</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where our tag watcher code didn&rsquo;t consider the default revision to be the same as the default tag. This would cause issues where Kubernetes gateways wouldn&rsquo;t be programmed.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56767\">Issue #56767</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing Gateway chart installation failures with Helm v3.18.5 due to a stricter JSON schema validator. The chart&rsquo;s schema has been updated to be compatible.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57354\">Issue #57354</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>PreserveHeaderCase</code> option was overriding other HTTP/1.x protocol options, such as HTTP/1.0.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57528\">Issue #57528</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a change in output of <code>istioctl proxy-status</code> to be more consistent with previous versions.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57339\">Issue #57339</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> iptables detection logic to fall back to <code>iptables-nft</code> when the <code>iptable_nat</code> module is missing.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57380\">Issue #57380</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug that incorrectly rejected traffic policies when only <code>retry_budget</code> was set.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

</aside>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"inference-extension-support\">Inference Extension Support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> is an official Kubernetes project designed to optimize the self-hosting of Generative AI models on Kubernetes. It provides a standardized, vendor-neutral approach to intelligent AI traffic management.</p>\n<p>Istio 1.27 includes a <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/gateways/#istio\">fully-compliant implementation</a> of the extension when using the Gateway API for cluster ingress traffic control.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/2025/inference-extension-support/\">Learn more about the extension and Istio&rsquo;s implementation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambient-multicluster\">Ambient Multicluster</h3>\n<p>Support for multi-cluster deployments in ambient mode is now available in Alpha. This enables multiple ambient mode clusters to be connected into the same mesh, expanding the scope of no-sidecar networking to larger and more distributed environments.</p>\n<p>In this initial release, testing has been focused on multi-network, multi-primary topologies, where each cluster runs its own control plane. Support for more complex topologies will follow as the baseline feature matures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-support-for-plugged-in-cas\">CRL Support for Plugged-in CAs</h3>\n<p>Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support is now available for users who have &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; their own certificate authority, rather than using the default provided by Istio.  This allows proxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of mesh deployments using plugged-in CAs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"listenersets-support\">ListenerSets Support</h3>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1713\">ListenerSets</a> API allows you to define a reusable set of listeners that can be attached to a <code>Gateway</code> resource. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication when managing multiple Gateways that share common listener configurations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"native-nftables-support-in-sidecar-mode\">Native nftables Support in Sidecar Mode</h3>\n<p>Istio now supports the <a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47821\">native nftables</a> backend in Sidecar mode. nftables is the modern successor to iptables, providing better performance, improved maintainability, and more flexible rule management for transparent traffic redirection to and from the Envoy sidecar proxy.</p>\n<p>Many major Linux distributions are adopting nftables as the default packet filtering framework, and Istio’s native support ensures compatibility with this shift.</p>\n<p>Support for nftables in ambient mode is actively being developed and will arrive in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-127\">Upgrading to 1.27</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.27. You can provide feedback in the <code>#release-1.27</code> channel in our <a href=\"https://slack.istio.io/\">Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n<p>Would you like to contribute directly to Istio?

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> traffic distribution to disregard subzone when the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field is set to <code>PreferClose</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for multiple server certificates in gateway (istio &amp; Gateway API). (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36181\">Issue #36181</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> alpha support for specifying <code>ServiceScope</code> in the MeshConfig in ambient multicluster configurations.\n<code>ServiceScope</code> enables the selection of individual services or services in a namespace to be global or local.\nA locally scoped service is only discoverable by the data plane in the same cluster as the service. A local\nservice is not discoverable by the data planes in other clusters. A globally-scoped service is discoverable\nby the data planes in all clusters. Defining selectors for the <code>serviceScopeConfigs</code> determines which services\nand workloads are shared with the data plane and which clusters and listeners are configured for the waypoints\n(including e/w gateways) in the mesh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature flag <code>EnableGatewayAPICopyLabelsAnnotations</code> to allow\nusers to choose whether the deployment resources will inherit attributes from\nthe parent Gateway API resource. This feature is enabled by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>PreferSameNode</code> and <code>PreferSameZone</code> on the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Pilot environment variables <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV4_PREFIX</code> and <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV6_PREFIX</code> to configure the IP CIDR prefix(es) for auto-allocated IPs. This allows users to set a specific range of IPs for auto-allocation, providing more control over the IP address space used for VIPs by the ipallocate controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> logging of a secret&rsquo;s namespace and name when a certificate is invalid.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56651\">Issue #56651</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a>.\nThis feature is off by default and can be turned on with the <code>SUPPORT_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION</code> environment variable.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55768\">Issue #55768</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for merge operations when applying to <code>LISTENER_FILTER</code> in EnvoyFilter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> that allows to enable lazy initialization of sidecar resources,\nOnly computing internal indexes when <code>SidecarScopes</code> are actually used by a Proxy. This feature supersedes the\nprevious <code>PILOT_CONVERT_SIDECAR_SCOPE_CONCURRENCY</code> which would allow concurrent conversion with specific given concurrency,\ninstead <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> will use the same concurrency as <code>PILOT_PUSH_THROTTLE</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for native <code>nftables</code> when using Istio sidecar mode. This update makes it possible to use <code>nftables</code>\ninstead of iptables to manage network rules, offering more efficient approach to traffic redirection for pods and\nservices. To enable the <code>nftables</code> mode, use <code>--set values.global.nativeNftables=true</code> at the time of installation.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56487\">Issue #56487</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying traffic distribution mode for services. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53354\">Issue #53354</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_PROXY_FIND_POD_BY_IP</code> that allows enabling association of Pods to Proxies by IP address, if the association by name and namespace fails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support of retry budget in <code>DestinationRule</code> resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the gateway status controller leader election was not running per revision, which could lead to issues in multi-revision setups.\nThe leader election is now correctly scoped to each revision, ensuring that the gateway status controller operates independently for each revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55717\">Issue #55717</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where virtual service routes were ignored when the virtual service was configured with hosts containing mixed-case letters.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55767\">Issue #55767</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a regression in Istio 1.26.0 that caused a panic in istiod when processing Gateway API hostnames.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56300\">Issue #56300</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where mTLS was disabled unexpectedly when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> or <code>PILOT_ENDPOINT_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> was set to <code>false</code>\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56352\">Issue #56352</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ambient host network iptables rules were being skipped due to higher-priority CNI rules in some deployments.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56414\">Issue #56414</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with <code>targetRefs</code> matched incorrect resources.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56417\">Issue #56417</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> ambient index to filter configurations by their revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477\">Issue #56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label was not properly skipped on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> were in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI plugin incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod, which had been deleted, to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurred, ztunnel would not be able to become ready.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56738\">Issue #56738</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio&rsquo;s outbound route configuration did not include the absolute domain name  (fully-qualified domain name with trailing dot) in the domains list for <code>VirtualHost</code> entries. This change ensures that requests using absolute domain names (ending with a dot, e.g., <code>my-service.my-ns.svc.cluster.local.</code>) are properly routed to the intended service instead of falling back to <code>PassthroughCluster</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56007\">Issue #56007</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for omitting the issuer claim in JWT tokens. Either the issuer claim or a <code>JWKSUri</code> is required,\nbut not both. This allows for more flexible configurations when using JWT tokens for authentication, particularly\nin scenarios where the issuer claim may be dynamic. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14400\">Issue #14400</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an opt-in feature when using istio-cni in ambient mode, to create an Istio-owned CNI config\nfile which contains the contents of the primary CNI config file and the Istio CNI plugin. This\nopt-in feature is a solution to the issue of traffic bypassing the mesh on node restart when the\nIstio CNI <code>DaemonSet</code> is not ready, the Istio CNI plugin is not installed, or the plugin is not\ninvoked to configure traffic redirection from pods their node ztunnels. This feature is enabled by\nsetting <code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfig</code> to true in the istio-cni Helm chart values. If no value is set for\n<code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code>, the Istio-owned CNI config file will be named <code>02-istio-cni.conflist</code>.\nThe <code>istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code> value must have a higher lexicographical priority than the primary CNI.\nAmbient and chained CNI plugins must be enabled for this feature to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> validation for the istioctl <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument. It should not have more than one alias per cluster.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> by migrating from <code>certificates.k8s.io/v1alpha1</code> to the stable <code>v1beta1</code> API in Kubernetes 1.33+. This improves compatibility and future-proofs Istio’s certificate distribution mechanism.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56306\">Issue #56306</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for external Secret Discovery Service (SDS) providers in the Gateway TLS configuration. Istio now provides\nimproved integration with external SDS providers for TLS certificate management at the Gateway.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56522\">Issue #56522</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> certificate revocation list (CRL) support for plugged-in CAs, enabling Istio to watch for <code>ca-crl.pem</code> files and\nautomatically distribute CRLs across all namespaces in the cluster. This enhancement allows\nproxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of service mesh deployments\nusing plugged-in CAs.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56529\">Issue #56529</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) option to <code>COMPLIANCE_POLICY</code>.\nThis policy enforces TLS <code>v1.3</code>, cipher suites <code>TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> and <code>TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code>,\nand post-quantum-safe key exchange <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.\nTo enable this compliance policy in ambient mode, it must be set in the pilot and ztunnel containers.\nThis policy applies to the following data paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mTLS communication between Envoy proxies and ztunnels;</li>\n<li>regular TLS on the downstream and the upstream of Envoy proxies (e.g. gateway);</li>\n<li>Istio xDS server.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56330\">Issue #56330</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where sidecars with the old <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> setting were not able to connect to istiod with the new <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> settings when <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument was being used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the <code>pluginca</code> feature where <code>istiod</code> would silently fallback to the self-signed CA if the provided <code>cacerts</code> bundle was incomplete.\nThe system now properly validates the presence of all required CA files and fails with an error if the bundle is incomplete.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Grafana dashboard was linking to the Istio Mesh Dashboard using path-based links that no longer work. Workload and Service links now use dashboard UIDs.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50124\">Issue #50124</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not being updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825\">Issue #56825</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> support of the <code>Lightstep</code> tracing provider.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54002\">Issue #54002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"extensibility\">Extensibility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added</strong> an option to reload the Wasm VM on new requests if the VM has failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> the environment variable <code>ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS</code> to default to <code>true</code>. This means native sidecars will be injected into all eligible pods unless explicitly disabled.\nThis can be disabled explicitly or for specific workloads by adding the annotation <code>sidecar.istio.io/native-side: &quot;false&quot;</code> to individual pods or pod templates.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/48794\">Issue #48794</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a setting <code>values.global.trustBundleName</code> that allows configuring the name of the ConfigMap that istiod uses to propagate its root CA certificate in the cluster. This allows running multiple control planes with overlapping namespaces in the same cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for customizing ambient enablement Labels.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53578\">Issue #53578</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring <code>additionalContainers</code> and <code>initContainers</code> on the Gateway Helm Chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring ztunnel tolerations via Helm chart values.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56086\">Issue #56086</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring istio-cni tolerations via Helm chart values.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56087\">Issue #56087</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> defined defaults for <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> and <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> divisors to fix an Argo perpetual out-of-sync issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> bootstrap override config for the <code>gateway-injection-template</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/28302\">Issue #28302</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>ENABLE_NATIVE_SIDECARS</code> Helm value in the compatibility profiles of Istio 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26, allowing users to disable the default enabling of native sidecars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for proxy protocol on status port. (<a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/reference/commands/pilot-agent/#envvars\">reference</a>)\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39868\">Issue #39868</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Helm value <code>.Values.istiodRemote.enabledLocalInjectorIstiod</code> to support sidecar injection in remote clusters.\nWhen <code>profile=remote</code>, <code>.Values.istiodRemote.enabledLocalInjectorIstiod=true</code>, and <code>.Values.global.remotePilotAddress=&quot;${DISCOVERY_ADDRESS}&quot;</code>,\nthe remote worker cluster installs <code>istiod</code> for local sidecar injection, while XDS is still served by the remote primary cluster.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56328\">Issue #56328</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the <code>istio.io/rev</code> label to the istio remote service when <code>istiodRemote</code> is enabled\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56142\">Issue #56142</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>deploymentAnnotations</code> in the istiod Helm chart. Users can now specify custom annotations to be applied to the istiod Deployment object, in addition to the existing <code>podAnnotations</code> support. This is useful for integration with monitoring tools, GitOps workflows, and policy enforcement systems that operate at the deployment level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>ISTIO_KUBE_APP_PROBERS</code> environment variable was not set for probe rewrites when the Istio webhook was re-invoked.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56102\">Issue #56102</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where secrets references in the env of <code>istio/gateway</code> Helm chart were incorrectly rendered as a string.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55141\">Issue #55141</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an injection failure that occurred when the <code>gateway</code> template was combined with another template, like <code>spire</code>,\nwhich overrides <code>workload-socket</code>, resulted in Kubernetes not creating other volumes, like those with <code>emptyDir</code> and <code>csi</code> settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a panic in <code>istioctl manifest translate</code> when the <code>IstioOperator</code> config contained multiple gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56223\">Issue #56223</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> assignment of incorrect UIDs and GIDs for <code>istio-proxy</code> and <code>istio-validation</code> containers on OpenShift clusters when TPROXY mode was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> was not properly configured when <code>ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API</code> was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> unused multicluster-related Helm values.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the <code>--kubeclient-timeout</code> flag to <code>istioctl</code> root flags. May be unset, or set to a valid <code>time.Duration</code> string.\nWhen specified, this will override the default <code>15s</code> timeout for all <code>istioctl</code> commands that use the Kubernetes client.\nThis is useful for environments with slow Kubernetes API servers, such as those with high latency or low bandwidth.\nNote that this flag is just used for the Kubernetes client, and does not affect other timeouts in <code>istioctl</code>, such as\ninstallation timeouts.

caused service disruption due to preexisting iptables rules.\nThe iptables binary detection logic has been improved to verify a degree of baseline kernel support exists, and prefer <code>nft</code> in a <code>tie</code> situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing false positives with <code>istioctl analyze</code> raising IST0134 even when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE</code> was set to <code>true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56083\">Issue #56083</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a panic in <code>istioctl manifest translate</code> when the IstioOperator config contained multiple gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56223\">Issue #56223</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> ambient index to filter configs by revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477\">Issue #56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> incorrect UID and GID assignment for <code>istio-proxy</code> and <code>istio-validation</code> containers on OpenShift when TPROXY mode was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> logic to properly ignore the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> are in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

The Prometheus team worked hard to ensure backwards-compatibility and not to break existing installations, so all of the new features described below build on top of existing functionality. Most users should be able to try Prometheus 3.0 out of the box without any configuration changes.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>With over 7500 commits in the 7 years since Prometheus 2.0 came out there are too many new individual features and fixes to list, but there are some big shiny and breaking changes we wanted to call out. We need everyone in the community to try them out and report any issues you might find.\nThe more feedback we get, the more stable the final 3.0 release can be.</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-09-11/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view, and will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.\nSince the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs.

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

      "summary": "<blockquote>\n<p>Bartek Płotka has been a Prometheus Maintainer since 2019 and Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat. Co-author of the CNCF Thanos project. CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>.

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
