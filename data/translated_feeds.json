      "summary": "<p>On behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am excited to announce that the <strong>in-place Pod resize</strong> feature (also known as In-Place Pod Vertical Scaling), first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.27, has graduated to <strong>Beta</strong> and will be enabled by default in the Kubernetes v1.33 release! This marks a significant milestone in making resource management for Kubernetes workloads more flexible and less disruptive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-place-pod-resize\">What is in-place Pod resize?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, changing the CPU or memory resources allocated to a container required restarting the Pod. While acceptable for many stateless applications, this could be disruptive for stateful services, batch jobs, or any workloads sensitive to restarts.</p>\n<p>In-place Pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory requests and limits assigned to containers within a <em>running</em> Pod, often without requiring a container restart.</p>\n<p>Here's the core idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>spec.containers[*].resources</code> field in a Pod specification now represents the <em>desired</em> resources and is mutable for CPU and memory.</li>\n<li>The <code>status.containerStatuses[*].resources</code> field reflects the <em>actual</em> resources currently configured on a running container.</li>\n<li>You can trigger a resize by updating the desired resources in the Pod spec via the new <code>resize</code> subresource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can try it out on a v1.33 Kubernetes cluster by using kubectl to edit a Pod (requires <code>kubectl</code> v1.32+):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kubectl edit pod &lt;pod-name&gt; --subresource resize\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation:\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-in-place-pod-resize-matter\">Why does in-place Pod resize matter?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes still excels at scaling workloads horizontally (adding or removing replicas), but in-place Pod resizing unlocks several key benefits for vertical scaling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Disruption:</strong> Stateful applications, long-running batch jobs, and sensitive workloads can have their resources adjusted without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a Pod restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Resource Utilization:</strong> Scale down over-provisioned Pods without disruption, freeing up resources in the cluster. Conversely, provide more resources to Pods under heavy load without needing a restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Scaling:</strong> Address transient resource needs more quickly. For example Java applications often need more CPU during startup than during steady-state operation. Start with higher CPU and resize down later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-changed-between-alpha-and-beta\">What's changed between Alpha and Beta?</h2>\n<p>Since the alpha release in v1.27, significant work has gone into maturing the feature, improving its stability, and refining the user experience based on feedback and further development. Here are the key changes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-user-facing-changes\">Notable user-facing changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>resize</code> Subresource:</strong> Modifying Pod resources must now be done via the Pod's <code>resize</code> subresource (<code>kubectl patch pod &lt;name&gt; --subresource resize ...</code>). <code>kubectl</code> versions v1.32+ support this argument.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize Status via Conditions:</strong> The old <code>status.resize</code> field is deprecated. The status of a resize operation is now exposed via two Pod conditions:\n<ul>\n<li><code>PodResizePending</code>: Indicates the Kubelet cannot grant the resize immediately (e.g., <code>reason: Deferred</code> if temporarily unable, <code>reason: Infeasible</code> if impossible on the node).</li>\n<li><code>PodResizeInProgress</code>: Indicates the resize is accepted and being applied. Errors encountered during this phase are now reported in this condition's message with <code>reason: Error</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Sidecar Support:</strong> Resizing <a class=\"glossary-tooltip\" href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"An auxilliary container that stays running throughout the lifecycle of a Pod.\">sidecar containers</a> in-place is now supported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"stability-and-reliability-enhancements\">Stability and reliability enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refined Allocated Resources Management:</strong> The allocation management logic with the Kubelet was significantly reworked, making it more consistent and robust. The changes eliminated whole classes of bugs, and greatly improved the reliability of in-place Pod resize.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Checkpointing &amp; State Tracking:</strong> A more robust system for tracking &quot;allocated&quot; and &quot;actuated&quot; resources was implemented, using new checkpoint files (<code>allocated_pods_state</code>, <code>actuated_pods_state</code>) to reliably manage resize state across Kubelet restarts and handle edge cases where runtime-reported resources differ from requested ones. Several bugs related to checkpointing and state restoration were fixed. Checkpointing efficiency was also improved.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Resize Detection:</strong> Enhancements to the Kubelet's Pod Lifecycle Event Generator (PLEG) allow the Kubelet to respond to and complete resizes much more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced CRI Integration:</strong> A new <code>UpdatePodSandboxResources</code> CRI call was added to better inform runtimes and plugins (like NRI) about Pod-level resource changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Numerous Bug Fixes:</strong> Addressed issues related to systemd cgroup drivers, handling of containers without limits, CPU minimum share calculations, container restart backoffs, error propagation, test stability, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>Graduating to Beta means the feature is ready for broader adoption, but development doesn't stop here! Here's what the community is focusing on next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stability and Productionization:</strong> Continued focus on hardening the feature, improving performance, and ensuring it is robust for production environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Addressing Limitations:</strong> Working towards relaxing some of the current limitations noted in the documentation, such as allowing memory limit decreases.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/autoscaling/#scaling-workloads-vertically\">VerticalPodAutoscaler</a> (VPA) Integration:</strong> Work to enable VPA to leverage in-place Pod resize is already underway. A new <code>InPlaceOrRecreate</code> update mode will allow it to attempt non-disruptive resizes first, or fall back to recreation if needed. This will allow users to benefit from VPA's recommendations with significantly less disruption.</li>\n<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Gathering feedback from users adopting the beta feature is crucial for prioritizing further enhancements and addressing any uncovered issues or bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started-and-providing-feedback\">Getting started and providing feedback</h2>\n<p>With the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code> feature gate enabled by default in v1.33, you can start experimenting with in-place Pod resizing right away!</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">documentation</a> for detailed guides and examples.</p>\n<p>As this feature moves through Beta, your feedback is invaluable. Please report any issues or share your experiences via the standard Kubernetes communication channels (GitHub issues, mailing lists, Slack). You can also review the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1287-in-place-update-pod-resources\">KEP-1287: In-place Update of Pod Resources</a> for the full in-depth design details.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing how the community leverages in-place Pod resize to build more efficient and resilient applications on Kubernetes!</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>This announcement originally <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/announcing-etcd-3.6/\">appeared</a> on the etcd blog.</em></p>\n<p>Today, we are releasing <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.6.0\">etcd v3.6.0</a>, the first minor release since etcd v3.5.0 on June 15, 2021. This release\nintroduces several new features, makes significant progress on long-standing efforts like downgrade support and\nmigration to v3store, and addresses numerous critical &amp; major issues. It also includes major optimizations in\nmemory usage, improving efficiency and performance.</p>\n<p>In addition to the features of v3.6.0, etcd has joined Kubernetes as a SIG (sig-etcd), enabling us to improve\nproject sustainability. We've introduced systematic robustness testing to ensure correctness and reliability.\nThrough the etcd-operator Working Group, we plan to improve usability as well.</p>\n<p>What follows are the most significant changes introduced in etcd v3.6.0, along with the discussion of the\nroadmap for future development. For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>etcd takes security seriously. To enhance software security in v3.6.0, we have improved our workflow checks by\nintegrating <code>govulncheck</code> to scan the source code and <code>trivy</code> to scan container images. These improvements\nhave also been backported to supported stable releases.</p>\n<p>etcd continues to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/security/security-release-process.md\">Security Release Process</a> to ensure vulnerabilities are properly managed and addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<h3 id=\"migration-to-v3store\">Migration to v3store</h3>\n<p>The v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4 but could still be enabled via <code>--enable-v2</code>. It remained the source of\ntruth for membership data. In etcd v3.6.0, v2store can no longer be enabled as the <code>--enable-v2</code> flag has been removed,\nand v3store has become the sole source of truth for membership data.</p>\n<p>While v2store still exists in v3.6.0, etcd will fail to start if it contains any data other than membership information.\nTo assist with migration, etcd v3.5.18+ provides the <code>etcdutl check v2store</code> command, which verifies that v2store\ncontains only membership data (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19113\">PR 19113</a>).</p>\n<p>Compared to v2store, v3store offers better performance and transactional support. It is also the actively maintained\nstorage engine moving forward.</p>\n<p>The removal of v2store is still ongoing and is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downgrade\">Downgrade</h3>\n<p>etcd v3.6.0 is the first version to fully support downgrade. The effort for this downgrade task spans\nboth versions 3.5 and 3.6, and all related work is tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11716\">issues/11716</a>.</p>\n<p>At a high level, the process involves migrating the data schema to the target version (e.g., v3.5),\nfollowed by a rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>Ensure the cluster is healthy, and take a snapshot backup. Validate whether the downgrade is valid:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade validate 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade validate success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the downgrade is valid, enable downgrade mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>$ etcdctl downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> 3.5\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>Downgrade <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">enable</span> success, cluster version 3.6\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>etcd will then migrate the data schema in the background. Once complete, proceed with the rolling downgrade.</p>\n<p>For details, refer to the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/downgrades/downgrade_3_6/\">Downgrade-3.6</a> guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-gates\">Feature gates</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, we introduced Kubernetes-style feature gates for managing new features. Previously, we\nindicated unstable features through the <code>--experimental</code> prefix in feature flag names. The prefix was removed\nonce the feature was stable, causing a breaking change. Now, features will start in Alpha, progress\nto Beta, then GA, or get deprecated. This ensures a much smoother upgrade and downgrade experience for users.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/feature-gates/\">feature-gates</a> for details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livezreadyz-checks\">livez / readyz checks</h3>\n<p>etcd now supports <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code> endpoints, aligning with Kubernetes' Liveness and Readiness probes.\n<code>/livez</code> indicates whether the etcd instance is alive, while <code>/readyz</code> indicates when it is ready to serve requests.\nThis feature has also been backported to release-3.5 (starting from v3.5.11) and release-3.4 (starting from v3.4.29).\nSee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/monitoring/\">livez/readyz</a> for details.</p>\n<p>The existing <code>/health</code> endpoint remains functional. <code>/livez</code> is similar to <code>/health?serializable=true</code>, while\n<code>/readyz</code> is similar to <code>/health</code> or <code>/health?serializable=false</code>. Clearly, the <code>/livez</code> and <code>/readyz</code>\nendpoints provide clearer semantics and are easier to understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"v3discovery\">v3discovery</h3>\n<p>In etcd v3.6.0, the new discovery protocol <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v3discovery</a> was introduced, based on clientv3.\nIt facilitates the discovery of all cluster members during the bootstrap phase.</p>\n<p>The previous <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/dev-internal/discovery_protocol/\">v2discovery</a> protocol, based on clientv2, has been deprecated. Additionally,\nthe public discovery service at <a href=\"https://discovery.etcd.io/\">https://discovery.etcd.io/</a>, which relied on v2discovery, is no longer maintained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"memory\">Memory</h3>\n<p>In this release, we reduced average memory consumption by at least 50% (see Figure 1). This improvement is primarily due to two changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default value of <code>--snapshot-count</code> has been reduced from 100,000 in v3.5 to 10,000 in v3.6. As a result, etcd v3.6 now retains only about 10% of the history records compared to v3.5.</li>\n<li>Raft history is compacted more frequently, as introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/18825\">PR/18825</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"figure-1\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/2025-05-19-announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-1.png\" title=\"Diagram of memory usage\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Memory usage comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under different read/write ratios.\nEach subplot shows the memory usage over time with a specific read/write ratio. The red line represents etcd\nv3.5.20, while the teal line represents v3.6.0-rc.2. Across all tested ratios, v3.6.0-rc.2 exhibits lower and\nmore stable memory usage.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"throughput\">Throughput</h3>\n<p>Compared to v3.5, etcd v3.6 delivers an average performance improvement of approximately 10%\nin both read and write throughput (see Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5). This improvement is not attributed to\nany single major change, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple minor enhancements. One such\nexample is the optimization of the free page queries introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt/pull/419\">PR/419</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"figure-2\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/2025-05-19-announcing-etcd-3.6/figure-2.png\" title=\"etcd read transaction performance with a high write ratio\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Read throughput comparison between etcd v3.5.20 and v3.6.0-rc.2 under a high write ratio.

For a complete list, please refer to\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-3.6.md\">CHANGELOG-3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>Old binaries are incompatible with new schema versions</p>\n<p>Old etcd binaries are not compatible with newer data schema versions. For example, etcd 3.5 cannot start with\ndata created by etcd 3.6, and etcd 3.4 cannot start with data created by either 3.5 or 3.6.</p>\n<p>When downgrading etcd, it's important to follow the documented downgrade procedure. Simply replacing\nthe binary or image will result in the incompatibility issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peer-endpoints-no-longer-serve-client-requests\">Peer endpoints no longer serve client requests</h3>\n<p>Client endpoints (<code>--advertise-client-urls</code>) are intended to serve client requests only, while peer\nendpoints (<code>--initial-advertise-peer-urls</code>) are intended solely for peer communication. However, due to an implementation\noversight, the peer endpoints were also able to handle client requests in etcd 3.4 and 3.5. This behavior was misleading and\nencouraged incorrect usage patterns. In etcd 3.6, this misleading behavior was corrected via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13565\">PR/13565</a>; peer endpoints\nno longer serve client requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-boundary-between-etcdctl-and-etcdutl\">Clear boundary between etcdctl and etcdutl</h3>\n<p>Both <code>etcdctl</code> and <code>etcdutl</code> are command line tools. <code>etcdutl</code> is an offline utility designed to operate directly on\netcd data files, while <code>etcdctl</code> is an online tool that interacts with etcd over a network. Previously, there were some\noverlapping functionalities between the two, but these overlaps were removed in 3.6.0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl defrag --data-dir</code></p>\n<p>The <code>etcdctl defrag</code> command only support online defragmentation and no longer supports offline defragmentation.\nTo perform offline defragmentation, use the <code>etcdutl defrag --data-dir</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot status</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports retrieving the status of a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot status</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code></p>\n<p><code>etcdctl</code> no longer supports restoring from a snapshot. Use the <code>etcdutl snapshot restore</code> command instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"critical-bug-fixes\">Critical bug fixes</h2>\n<p>Correctness has always been a top priority for the etcd project. In the process of developing 3.6.0, we found and\nfixed a few notable bugs that could lead to data inconsistency in specific cases. These fixes have been backported\nto previous releases, but we believe they deserve special mention here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Inconsistency when Crashing Under Load</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previously, when etcd was applying data, it would update the consistent-index first, followed by committing the\ndata. However, these operations were not atomic. If etcd crashed in between, it could lead to data inconsistency\n(see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766\">issue/13766</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.3 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/13854\">PR/13854</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Durability API guarantee broken in single node cluster</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a client writes data and receives a success response, the data is expected to be persisted. However, the data might\nbe lost if etcd crashes immediately after sending the success response to the client. This was a legacy issue (see <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14370\">issue/14370</a>)\naffecting all previous releases. It was addressed in v3.4.21 and v3.5.5 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14400\">PR/14400</a>, and fixed in raft side in\nmain branch (now release-3.6) with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14413\">PR/14413</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revision Inconsistency when Crashing During Defragmentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If etcd crashed during the defragmentation operation, upon restart, it might reapply\nsome entries which had already been applied, accordingly leading to the revision inconsistency issue\n(see the discussions in <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14685\">PR/14685</a>). The issue was introduced in v3.5.0, and fixed in v3.5.6 with <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14730\">PR/14730</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrade-issue\">Upgrade issue</h2>\n<p>This section highlights a common issue <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/19557\">issues/19557</a> in the etcd v3.5 to v3.6 upgrade that may cause the upgrade\nprocess to fail. For a complete upgrade guide, refer to <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/upgrades/upgrade_3_6/\">Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue was introduced in etcd v3.5.1, and resolved in v3.5.20.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong>: users are required to first upgrade to etcd v3.5.20 (or a higher patch version) before upgrading\nto etcd v3.6.0; otherwise, the upgrade may fail.</p>\n<p>For more background and technical context, see <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2025/upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue/\">upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing\">Testing</h2>\n<p>We introduced the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness\">Robustness testing</a> to verify correctness, which has always been our top priority.\nIt plays traffic of various types and volumes against an etcd cluster, concurrently injects a random\nfailpoint, records all operations (including both requests and responses), and finally performs a\nlinearizability check. It also verifies that the <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/learning/api_guarantees/#watch-apis\">Watch APIs</a> guarantees have not been violated.\nThe robustness test increases our confidence in ensuring the quality of each etcd release.</p>\n<p>We have migrated most of the etcd workflow tests to Kubernetes' Prow testing infrastructure to\ntake advantage of its benefit, such as nice dashboards for viewing test results and the ability\nfor contributors to rerun failed tests themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2>\n<p>While retaining all existing supported platforms, we have promoted Linux/ARM64 to Tier 1 support.\nFor more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/15951\">issues/15951</a>. For the complete list of supported platforms,\nsee <a href=\"https://etcd.io/docs/v3.6/op-guide/supported-platform/\">supported-platform</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dependencies\">Dependencies</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependency-bumping-guide\">Dependency bumping guide</h3>\n<p>We have published an official guide on how to bump dependencies for etcd’s main branch and stable releases.\nIt also covers how to update the Go version. For more details, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/dependency_management.md\">dependency_management</a>.\nWith this guide available, any contributors can now help with dependency upgrades.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-dependency-updates\">Core Dependency Updates</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt\">bbolt</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a> are two core dependencies of etcd.</p>\n<p>Both etcd v3.4 and v3.5 depend on bbolt v1.3, while etcd v3.6 depends on bbolt v1.4.</p>\n<p>For the release-3.4 and release-3.5 branches, raft is included in the etcd repository itself, so etcd v3.4 and v3.5\ndo not depend on an external raft module. Starting from etcd v3.6, raft was moved to a separate repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/raft\">raft</a>),\nand the first standalone raft release is v3.6.0. As a result, etcd v3.6.0 depends on raft v3.6.0.</p>\n<p>Please see the table below for a summary:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>etcd versions</th>\n<th>bbolt versions</th>\n<th>raft versions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3.4.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.5.x</td>\n<td>v1.3.x</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3.6.x</td>\n<td>v1.4.x</td>\n<td>v3.6.x</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"grpc-gateway-v2\">grpc-gateway@v2</h3>\n<p>We upgraded <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway\">grpc-gateway</a> from v1 to v2 via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/16595\">PR/16595</a> in etcd v3.6.0. This is a major step toward\nmigrating to <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go\">protobuf-go</a>, the second major version of the Go protocol buffer API implementation.</p>\n<p>grpc-gateway@v2 is designed to work with <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go\">protobuf-go</a>. However, etcd v3.6 still depends on the deprecated\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gogo/protobuf\">gogo/protobuf</a>, which is actually protocol buffer v1 implementation. To resolve this incompatibility,\nwe applied a <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/158b9e0d468d310c3edf4cf13f2458c51b0406fa/scripts/genproto.sh#L151-L184\">patch</a> to the generated *.pb.gw.go files to convert v1 messages to v2 messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grpc-ecosystem-go-grpc-middleware-providers-prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus</h3>\n<p>We switched from the deprecated (and archived) <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus</a> to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/tree/main/providers/prometheus\">grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus</a> via <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/19195\">PR/19195</a>. This change ensures continued\nsupport and access to the latest features and improvements in the gRPC Prometheus integration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"community\">Community</h2>\n<p>There are exciting developments in the etcd community that reflect our ongoing commitment\nto strengthening collaboration, improving maintainability, and evolving the project’s governance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"etcd-becomes-a-kubernetes-sig\">etcd Becomes a Kubernetes SIG</h3>\n<p>etcd has officially become a Kubernetes Special Interest Group: SIG-etcd. This change reflects\netcd’s critical role as the primary datastore for Kubernetes and establishes a more structured\nand transparent home for long-term stewardship and cross-project collaboration. The new SIG\ndesignation will help streamline decision-making, align roadmaps with Kubernetes needs,\nand attract broader community involvement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"new-contributors-maintainers-and-reviewers\">New contributors, maintainers, and reviewers</h3>\n<p>We’ve seen increasing engagement from contributors, which has resulted in the addition of three new maintainers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fuweid\">fuweid</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jmhbnz\">jmhbnz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wenjiaswe\">wenjiaswe</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their continued contributions have been instrumental in driving the project forward.</p>\n<p>We also welcome two new reviewers to the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ivanvc\">ivanvc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/siyuanfoundation\">siyuanfoundation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We appreciate their dedication to code quality and their willingness to take on broader review responsibilities\nwithin the community.</p>\n<p>New release team</p>\n<p>We've formed a new release team led by <a href=\"https://github.com/ivanvc\">ivanvc</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jmhbnz\">jmhbnz</a>, streamlining the release process by automating\nmany previously manual steps. Inspired by Kubernetes SIG Release, we've adopted several best practices, including\nclearly defined release team roles and the introduction of release shadows to support knowledge sharing and team\nsustainability. These changes have made our releases smoother and more reliable, allowing us to approach each\nrelease with greater confidence and consistency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-the-etcd-operator-working-group\">Introducing the etcd Operator Working Group</h3>\n<p>To further advance etcd’s operational excellence, we have formed a new working group: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-etcd-operator\">WG-etcd-operator</a>.\nThe working group is dedicated to enabling the automatic and efficient operation of etcd clusters that run in\nthe Kubernetes environment using an etcd-operator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-development\">Future Development</h2>\n<p>The legacy v2store has been deprecated since etcd v3.4, and the flag <code>--enable-v2</code> was removed entirely in v3.6.\nThis means that starting from v3.6, there is no longer a way to enable or use the v2store. However, etcd still\nbootstraps internally from the legacy v2 snapshots. To address this inconsistency, We plan to change etcd to\nbootstrap from the v3store and replay the WAL entries based on the <code>consistent-index</code>. The work is being tracked\nin <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913\">issues/12913</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the most persistent challenges remains the large range of queries from the kube-apiserver, which can\nlead to process crashes due to their unpredictable nature. The range stream feature, originally outlined in\nthe <a href=\"https://etcd.io/blog/2021/announcing-etcd-3.5/#future-roadmaps\">v3.5 release blog/Future roadmaps</a>, remains an idea worth revisiting to address the challenges of large\nrange queries.</p>\n<p>For more details and upcoming plans, please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/roadmap.md\">etcd roadmap</a>.</p>",

Unfortunately, a leader-follower Kubernetes Job that didn't use a success policy, in most cases, would have to require <strong>all</strong> Pods to finish successfully\nfor that Job to reach an overall succeeded state.</p>\n<p>For Kubernetes Jobs, the API allows you to specify the early exit criteria using the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code>\nfield (you can only use the <code>.spec.successPolicy</code> field for an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concept/workloads/controllers/job/#completion-mode\">indexed Job</a>).\nWhich describes a set of rules either using a list of succeeded indexes for a job, or defining a minimal required size of succeeded indexes.</p>\n<p>This newly stable field is especially valuable for scientific simulation, AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) batch workloads.\nUsers in these areas often run numerous experiments and may only need a specific number to complete successfully, rather than requiring all of them to succeed.\nIn this case, the leader index failure is the only relevant Job exit criteria, and the outcomes for individual follower Pods are handled\nonly indirectly via the status of the leader index.\nMoreover, followers do not know when they can terminate themselves.</p>\n<p>After Job meets any <strong>Success Policy</strong>, the Job is marked as succeeded, and all Pods are terminated including the running ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>The following excerpt from a Job manifest, using <code>.successPolicy.rules[0].succeededCount</code>, shows an example of\nusing a custom success policy:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000;

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/14/kubernetes-v1-33-updates-to-container-lifecycle/",
      "published": "Wed, 14 May 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes v1.33 introduces a few updates to the lifecycle of containers. The Sleep action for container lifecycle hooks now supports a zero sleep duration (feature enabled by default).\nThere is also alpha support for customizing the stop signal sent to containers when they are being terminated.</p>\n<p>This blog post goes into the details of these new aspects of the container lifecycle, and how you can use them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zero-value-for-sleep-action\">Zero value for Sleep action</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.29 introduced the <code>Sleep</code> action for container PreStop and PostStart Lifecycle hooks. The Sleep action lets your containers pause for a specified duration after the container is started or before it is terminated. This was needed to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns. Before the Sleep action, folks used to run the <code>sleep</code> command using the exec action in their container lifecycle hooks. If you wanted to do this you'd need to have the binary for the <code>sleep</code> command in your container image. This is difficult if you're using third party images.</p>\n<p>The sleep action when it was added initially didn't have support for a sleep duration of zero seconds. The <code>time.Sleep</code> which the Sleep action uses under the hood supports a duration of zero seconds. Using a negative or a zero value for the sleep returns immediately, resulting in a no-op. We wanted the same behaviour with the sleep action. This support for the zero duration was later added in v1.32, with the <code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate.</p>\n<p>The <code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate has graduated to beta in v1.33, and is now enabled by default.\nThe original Sleep action for <code>preStop</code> and <code>postStart</code> hooks is been enabled by default, starting from Kubernetes v1.30.\nWith a cluster running Kubernetes v1.33, you are able to set a\nzero duration for sleep lifecycle hooks. For a cluster with default configuration, you don't need\nto enable any feature gate to make that possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"container-stop-signals\">Container stop signals</h2>\n<p>Container runtimes such as containerd and CRI-O honor a <code>StopSignal</code> instruction in the container image definition. This can be used to specify a custom stop signal\nthat the runtime will used to terminate containers based on that image.\nStop signal configuration was not originally part of the Pod API in Kubernetes.\nUntil Kubernetes v1.33, the only way to override the stop signal for containers was by rebuilding your container image with the new custom stop signal\n(for example, specifying <code>STOPSIGNAL</code> in a <code>Containerfile</code> or <code>Dockerfile</code>).</p>\n<p>The <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate which is newly added in Kubernetes v1.33 adds stop signals to the Kubernetes API. This allows users to specify a custom stop signal in the container spec. Stop signals are added to the API as a new lifecycle along with the existing PreStop and PostStart lifecycle handlers. In order to use this feature, we expect the Pod to have the operating system specified with <code>spec.os.name</code>. This is enforced so that we can cross-validate the stop signal against the operating system and make sure that the containers in the Pod are created with a valid stop signal for the operating system the Pod is being scheduled to. For Pods scheduled on Windows nodes, only <code>SIGTERM</code> and <code>SIGKILL</code> are allowed as valid stop signals. Find the full list of signals supported in Linux nodes <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/api/core/v1/types.go#L2985-L3053\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"default-behaviour\">Default behaviour</h3>\n<p>If a container has a custom stop signal defined in its lifecycle, the container runtime would use the signal defined in the lifecycle to kill the container, given that the container runtime also supports custom stop signals. If there is no custom stop signal defined in the container lifecycle, the runtime would fallback to the stop signal defined in the container image. If there is no stop signal defined in the container image, the default stop signal of the runtime would be used. The default signal is <code>SIGTERM</code> for both containerd and CRI-O.</p>\n<h3 id=\"version-skew\">Version skew</h3>\n<p>For the feature to work as intended, both the versions of Kubernetes and the container runtime should support container stop signals. The changes to the Kuberentes API and kubelet are available in alpha stage from v1.33, which can be enabled with the <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate. The container runtime implementations for containerd and CRI-O are still a work in progress and will be rolled out soon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-container-stop-signals\">Using container stop signals</h3>\n<p>To enable this feature, you need to turn on the <code>ContainerStopSignals</code> feature gate in both the kube-apiserver and the kubelet. Once you have nodes where the feature gate is turned on, you can create Pods with a StopSignal lifecycle and a valid OS name like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Pod<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">os</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>linux<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">containers</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">image</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>nginx:latest<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">lifecycle</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">stopSignal</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>SIGUSR1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Do note that the <code>SIGUSR1</code> signal in this example can only be used if the container's Pod is scheduled to a Linux node.

Ideally, your workload\nshould tolerate transient failures and continue running.</p>\n<p>To achieve failure tolerance in a Kubernetes Job, you can set the\n<code>spec.backoffLimit</code> field. This field specifies the total number of tolerated\nfailures.</p>\n<p>However, for workloads where every index is considered independent, like\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel\">embarassingly parallel</a>\nworkloads - the <code>spec.backoffLimit</code> field is often not flexible enough.\nFor example, you may choose to run multiple suites of integration tests by\nrepresenting each suite as an index within an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/indexed-parallel-processing-static/\">Indexed Job</a>.\nIn that setup, a fast-failing index (test suite) is likely to consume your\nentire budget for tolerating Pod failures, and you might not be able to run the\nother indexes.</p>\n<p>In order to address this limitation, Kubernetes introduced <em>backoff limit per index</em>,\nwhich allows you to control the number of retries per index.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-backoff-limit-per-index-works\">How backoff limit per index works</h2>\n<p>To use Backoff Limit Per Index for Indexed Jobs, specify the number of tolerated\nPod failures per index with the <code>spec.backoffLimitPerIndex</code> field.

Given Kubernetes is all about running pods, it may be peculiar\nto learn that there has been a caveat to restricting pod access to authenticated images for\nover 10 years in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/18787\">issue 18787</a>!\nIt is an exciting release when you can resolve a ten-year-old issue.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note:</h4>Throughout this blog post, the term &quot;pod credentials&quot; will be used often. In this context,\nthe term generally encapsulates the authentication material that is available to a pod\nto authenticate a container image pull.</div>\n<h2 id=\"ifnotpresent-even-if-i-m-not-supposed-to-have-it\">IfNotPresent, even if I'm not supposed to have it</h2>\n<p>The gist of the problem is that the <code>imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code> strategy has done\nprecisely what it says, and nothing more. Let's set up a scenario. To begin, <em>Pod A</em> in <em>Namespace X</em> is scheduled to <em>Node 1</em> and requires <em>image Foo</em> from a private repository.\nFor it's image pull authentication material, the pod references <em>Secret 1</em> in its <code>imagePullSecrets</code>. <em>Secret 1</em> contains the necessary credentials to pull from the private repository. The Kubelet will utilize the credentials from <em>Secret 1</em> as supplied by <em>Pod A</em>\nand it will pull <em>container image Foo</em> from the registry. This is the intended (and secure)\nbehavior.</p>\n<p>But now things get curious. If <em>Pod B</em> in <em>Namespace Y</em> happens to also be scheduled to <em>Node 1</em>, unexpected (and potentially insecure) things happen. <em>Pod B</em> may reference the same private image, specifying the <code>IfNotPresent</code> image pull policy. <em>Pod B</em> does not reference <em>Secret 1</em>\n(or in our case, any secret) in its <code>imagePullSecrets</code>. When the Kubelet tries to run the pod, it honors the <code>IfNotPresent</code> policy. The Kubelet sees that the <em>image Foo</em> is already present locally, and will provide <em>image Foo</em> to <em>Pod B</em>. <em>Pod B</em> gets to run the image even though it did not provide credentials authorizing it to pull the image in the first place.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Illustration of the process of two pods trying to access a private image, the first one with a pull secret, the second one without it\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/12/kubernetes-v1-33-ensure-secret-pulled-images-alpha/ensure_secret_image_pulls.svg\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>Using a private image pulled by a different pod</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>While <code>IfNotPresent</code> should not pull <em>image Foo</em> if it is already present\non the node, it is an incorrect security posture to allow all pods scheduled\nto a node to have access to previously pulled private image. These pods were never\nauthorized to pull the image in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ifnotpresent-but-only-if-i-am-supposed-to-have-it\">IfNotPresent, but only if I am supposed to have it</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.33, we - SIG Auth and SIG Node - have finally started to address this (really old) problem and getting the verification right! The basic expected behavior is not changed. If\nan image is not present, the Kubelet will attempt to pull the image. The credentials each pod supplies will be utilized for this task. This matches behavior prior to 1.33.</p>\n<p>If the image is present, then the behavior of the Kubelet changes. The Kubelet will now\nverify the pod's credentials before allowing the pod to use the image.</p>\n<p>Performance and service stability have been a consideration while revising the feature.\nPods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate. This is\nalso true when pods source credentials from the same Kubernetes Secret object, even\nwhen the credentials are rotated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"never-pull-but-use-if-authorized\">Never pull, but use if authorized</h2>\n<p>The <code>imagePullPolicy: Never</code> option does not fetch images. However, if the\ncontainer image is already present on the node, any pod attempting to use the private\nimage will be required to provide credentials, and those credentials require verification.</p>\n<p>Pods utilizing the same credential will not be required to re-authenticate.\nPods that do not supply credentials previously used to successfully pull an\nimage will not be allowed to use the private image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"always-pull-if-authorized\">Always pull, if authorized</h2>\n<p>The <code>imagePullPolicy: Always</code> has always worked as intended. Each time an image\nis requested, the request goes to the registry and the registry will perform an authentication\ncheck.</p>\n<p>In the past, forcing the <code>Always</code> image pull policy via pod admission was the only way to ensure\nthat your private container images didn't get reused by other pods on nodes which already pulled the images.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this was somewhat performant. Only the image manifest was pulled, not the image. However, there was still a cost and a risk.

The following is a simplified description of how the feature works.\nFor the complete version, please see <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2535\">KEP-2535</a>.</p>\n<p>The process of requesting an image for the first time goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A pod requesting an image from a private registry is scheduled to a node.</li>\n<li>The image is not present on the node.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet makes a record of the intention to pull the image.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet extracts credentials from the Kubernetes Secret referenced by the pod\nas an image pull secret, and uses them to pull the image from the private registry.</li>\n<li>After the image has been successfully pulled, the Kubelet makes a record of\nthe successful pull. This record includes details about credentials used\n(in the form of a hash) as well as the Secret from which they originated.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet removes the original record of intent.</li>\n<li>The Kubelet retains the record of successful pull for later use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When future pods scheduled to the same node request the previously pulled private image:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Kubelet checks the credentials that the new pod provides for the pull.</li>\n<li>If the hash of these credentials, or the source Secret of the credentials match\nthe hash or source Secret which were recorded for a previous successful pull,\nthe pod is allowed to use the previously pulled image.</li>\n<li>If the credentials or their source Secret are not found in the records of\nsuccessful pulls for that image, the Kubelet will attempt to use\nthese new credentials to request a pull from the remote registry, triggering\nthe authorization flow.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.33 we shipped the alpha version of this feature.

      "summary": "<p>Managing Kubernetes cluster stability becomes increasingly critical as your infrastructure grows. One of the most challenging aspects of operating large-scale clusters has been handling List requests that fetch substantial datasets - a common operation that could unexpectedly impact your cluster's stability.</p>\n<p>Today, the Kubernetes community is excited to announce a significant architectural improvement: streaming encoding for List responses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-unnecessary-memory-consumption-with-large-resources\">The problem: unnecessary memory consumption with large resources</h2>\n<p>Current API response encoders just serialize an entire response into a single contiguous memory and perform one <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ResponseWriter.Write\">ResponseWriter.Write</a> call to transmit data to the client. Despite HTTP/2's capability to split responses into smaller frames for transmission, the underlying HTTP server continues to hold the complete response data as a single buffer. Even as individual frames are transmitted to the client, the memory associated with these frames cannot be freed incrementally.</p>\n<p>When cluster size grows, the single response body can be substantial - like hundreds of megabytes in size. At large scale, the current approach becomes particularly inefficient, as it prevents incremental memory release during transmission. Imagining that when network congestion occurs, that large response body’s memory block stays active for tens of seconds or even minutes. This limitation leads to unnecessarily high and prolonged memory consumption in the kube-apiserver process. If multiple large List requests occur simultaneously, the cumulative memory consumption can escalate rapidly, potentially leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) situation that compromises cluster stability.</p>\n<p>The encoding/json package uses sync.Pool to reuse memory buffers during serialization. While efficient for consistent workloads, this mechanism creates challenges with sporadic large List responses. When processing these large responses, memory pools expand significantly. But due to sync.Pool's design, these oversized buffers remain reserved after use. Subsequent small List requests continue utilizing these large memory allocations, preventing garbage collection and maintaining persistently high memory consumption in the kube-apiserver even after the initial large responses complete.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protocolbuffers.github.io/blob/c14731f55296f8c6367faa4f2e55a3d3594544c6/content/programming-guides/techniques.md?plain=1#L39\">Protocol Buffers</a> are not designed to handle large datasets. But it’s great for handling <strong>individual</strong> messages within a large data set. This highlights the need for streaming-based approaches that can process and transmit large collections incrementally rather than as monolithic blocks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>As a general rule of thumb, if you are dealing in messages larger than a megabyte each, it may be time to consider an alternate strategy.</em></p>\n<p><em>From <a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/techniques/\">https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/techniques/</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"streaming-encoder-for-list-responses\">Streaming encoder for List responses</h2>\n<p>The streaming encoding mechanism is specifically designed for List responses, leveraging their common well-defined collection structures. The core idea focuses exclusively on the <strong>Items</strong> field within collection structures, which represents the bulk of memory consumption in large responses. Rather than encoding the entire <strong>Items</strong> array as one contiguous memory block, the new streaming encoder processes and transmits each item individually, allowing memory to be freed progressively as frame or chunk is transmitted. As a result, encoding items one by one significantly reduces the memory footprint required by the API server.</p>\n<p>With Kubernetes objects typically limited to 1.5 MiB (from ETCD), streaming encoding keeps memory consumption predictable and manageable regardless of how many objects are in a List response. The result is significantly improved API server stability, reduced memory spikes, and better overall cluster performance - especially in environments where multiple large List operations might occur simultaneously.</p>\n<p>To ensure perfect backward compatibility, the streaming encoder validates Go struct tags rigorously before activation, guaranteeing byte-for-byte consistency with the original encoder. Standard encoding mechanisms process all fields except <strong>Items</strong>, maintaining identical output formatting throughout. This approach seamlessly supports all Kubernetes List types—from built-in <strong>*List</strong> objects to Custom Resource <strong>UnstructuredList</strong> objects - requiring zero client-side modifications or awareness that the underlying encoding method has changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance-gains-you-ll-notice\">Performance gains you'll notice</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced Memory Consumption:</strong> Significantly lowers the memory footprint of the API server when handling large <strong>list</strong> requests,\nespecially when dealing with <strong>large resources</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Scalability:</strong> Enables the API server to handle more concurrent requests and larger datasets without running out of memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Stability:</strong> Reduces the risk of OOM kills and service disruptions.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficient Resource Utilization:</strong> Optimizes memory usage and improves overall resource efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"benchmark-results\">Benchmark results</h2>\n<p>To validate results Kubernetes has introduced a new <strong>list</strong> benchmark which executes concurrently 10 <strong>list</strong> requests each returning 1GB of data.</p>\n<p>The benchmark has showed 20x improvement, reducing memory usage from 70-80GB to 3GB.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of a K8s performance dashboard showing memory usage for benchmark list going down from 60GB to 3GB\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/09/kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/results.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>List benchmark memory usage</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>",

      "published": "2025-05-13T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Choosing the right runtime security tool is critical for protecting modern cloud-native environments.  We recently undertook a rigorous evaluation process using real-world attack simulations on our Kubernetes clusters and Linux servers. Why? Because traditional cloud audit logs do not provide enough detail, leaving critical gaps in threat detection, incident response, and forensic analysis. Our evaluation meticulously examined each critical stage from initial access to lateral movement and data exfiltration.</p>\n<p>While we won't be naming the specific vendor in this post, we want to share our detailed methodology and key learnings, providing a blueprint you can adapt for your own security tool evaluations.</p>\n<h2>Why are runtime security tools necessary?</h2>\n<p>Without runtime security tools, detecting “suspicious activities” and understanding “what actually happened” during an attack can become extremely challenging.</p>\n<h3>Limitations of cloud audit logs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lack of runtime details</strong><br />\nCloud audit logs primarily record operations and data access within the cloud. However, they do not capture runtime-level activities on systems such as Kubernetes servers – overlooking fine-grained command executions, process behaviors, and transient network activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gaps in investigation and forensics</strong><br />\nIn Kubernetes environments, the absence of continuous, real-time logging can lead to the loss of critical activity records once a container terminates.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although well-known open-source runtime security tools are available, we decided to evaluate a commercial product to assess additional capabilities and enterprise-level support through attack simulation testing.</p>\n<h3>The role and purpose of runtime security tools</h3>\n<p>Runtime security tools address these cloud audit log limitations by continuously monitoring systems in real time, offering the following functionalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Threat detection</strong><br />\nThey monitor command executions, system calls, and network events in real-time to instantly detect abnormal behaviors, which enables the security team to respond rapidly. While some public cloud providers now offer limited runtime monitoring capabilities, these native solutions typically lack the depth and comprehensive coverage of dedicated security tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incident response</strong><br />\nBy maintaining detailed chronological records of system activities, these tools provide security teams with the evidence needed to reconstruct attack timelines, determine the full scope of compromise, and conduct thorough forensic investigations after an incident occurs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scalability in investigations</strong><br />\nUnlike traditional endpoint-by-endpoint forensic analysis, runtime security tools allow teams to collect, store, and analyze data centrally across the entire environment. This enables the efficient investigation of incidents without manually correlating disparate data sources.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> Products that also offer container information or server vulnerability monitoring are outside the scope of this discussion.)</p>\n<h2>Key evaluation points</h2>\n<p>Our primary objective in evaluating a runtime security tool was to determine its effectiveness in real-world security investigations. While evaluations often focus on the volume of detections or overall coverage, in actual operations, an overload of false positives – or tens of alerts for a single attack chain – can paralyze incident response teams. Therefore, our in-depth investigation centered on whether the tool could be used to support security operations with understanding and responding to actual attacks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Detection capability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Built-in rule</strong><br />\nWe assessed whether the built-in rule sets could effectively detect a variety of attack techniques and provide the necessary detail for accurate detection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom detection capabilities</strong><br />\nWe evaluated the ease with which additional rules could be integrated and considered the quality of telemetry data delivered by the product, which enabled us to build our own monitoring solutions leveraging our unique understanding of our environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alert quality</strong><br />\nWe also verified the rate of false positives. We confirmed that it effectively focuses on genuine security threats requiring action while minimizing noise that could cause alert fatigue.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incident response</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Richness of logs</strong><br />\nWe evaluated whether the logs capture sufficient details – including executed commands, network connections, DNS queries, and process information – to fully reconstruct the incident. The ability to piece together the entire attack scenario and determine the full impact is crucial during incident response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Log searchability</strong><br />\nWe assessed how effectively the tool allowed us to search, filter, and correlate events across multiple systems. The ability to quickly query massive volumes of data is essential for timely investigations during security incidents.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Evaluation process</h2>\n<p>We divided our evaluation process into four major phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Development of attack scenarios</strong><br />\nWe designed scenarios that mimicked real-world attack flows. These scenarios, developed in collaboration with our Red Team, included the following elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>attacks exploiting GitLab-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-22205)</li>\n<li>attacks leveraging the compromise of developer laptops</li>\n<li>detailed step-by-step attack procedures</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure setup</strong><br />\nWe deployed two parallel environments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes environment</li>\n<li>Virtual machine (VM) environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We installed an older version of GitLab to test known vulnerabilities and carried out similar evaluation flows in both the Kubernetes and VM environments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Execution of attacks</strong><br />\nWe executed the attack flow for each scenario and meticulously recorded the timeline – from initial access to lateral movement and data exfiltration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Analysis of results</strong><br />\nWe conducted a comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities, log richness, and areas for improvement, clearly outlining the strengths and weaknesses of the tools.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Attack scenarios</h3>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1: Exploitation of a known GitLab vulnerability</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Scenario 1: Exploitation of a known GitLab vulnerability\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5nRsqKVgc1cFYSjN31MHTd/172c8a4ccbf6f2f2cb0e03cf8a6eb8a8/image1.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attack flow</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial access</strong><br />\nWe simulated an attack by exploiting CVE-2021-22205, a known GitLab vulnerability that allows remote code execution.

compromised machine and take control.</li>\n<li><strong>Deployment of a C2 agent</strong><br />\nWe installed a Command and Control (C2) agent to evaluate persistence techniques, enabling us to execute further commands and manage the system remotely.</li>\n<li><strong>Lateral movement</strong><br />\nWe then moved laterally within the environment, accessing Kubernetes API secrets and PostgreSQL databases.</li>\n<li><strong>Data exfiltration</strong><br />\nWe exfiltrated sensitive data via a dedicated C2 channel.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following table summarizes the

followed these processes to obtain detailed records:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Verification of detections:</strong> We confirmed whether each attack command was detected and if the key points of each scenario were properly flagged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Timeline recording:</strong> Every event was logged in sequence to assess how well command executions and network communications were captured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scoring and analysis:</strong> We scored each event based on detection effectiveness to quantitatively evaluate the tool’s performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h3>Don't overestimate – test commercial products yourself</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identifying and addressing detection gaps (collaboration with vendors)</strong><br />\nOur evaluation revealed that several critical scenarios and events were not detected or not logged. Consequently, we held meetings with the vendor and submitted multiple improvement requests. As a result, the vendor enhanced the product by adding new features and improving detection capabilities, with many issues identified during our evaluation subsequently addressed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Understanding the limitations</strong><br />\nMany modern runtime security tools use eBPF to monitor Linux system calls for detection. However, because commands executed within a C2 framework do not generate new processes, tracing these attack events proved challenging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Recognizing tool boundaries</strong><br />\nOur findings highlighted that, during incident response, relying solely on runtime security tools is insufficient. It is essential to combine them with other logs, such as Kubernetes audit logs and cloud logs, to gain a comprehensive view.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The importance of continuous runtime event logging in Kubernetes</h3>\n<p>In Kubernetes environments, there is a risk of losing forensic data when containers terminate, making continuous logging indispensable. Our evaluation confirmed that establishing a scalable, persistent logging infrastructure is crucial. Without proper runtime security tools, a significant amount of critical information could be lost post-attack.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>We do not simply install security tools – we evaluate their utility to help ensure that our customers can safely use GitLab.com. Thorough product assessments like the one outlined above not only reveal unique use cases and areas for improvement that vendors might overlooks, but also provide valuable insights that benefit both the vendor and internal teams in organizing how the tool is best utilized.</p>",

The good news is that these tasks are great candidates to be completed with AI. Reducing the time spent on them will free you up to work on more important problems that you’re actually excited to tackle. With GitLab Duo Workflow, the time spent on these tasks will go from hours to minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/02/24/gitlab-duo-workflow-enterprise-visibility-and-control-for-agentic-ai/\">Duo Workflow</a> is a powerful new agentic solution, currently in private beta, that lives in VS Code and is designed to help you complete complex development tasks. While many AI coding assistants are focused on helping developers write code, Duo Workflow understands your project structure, reads your files, and can make coordinated changes across your entire codebase.</p>\n<p>I created a demonstration that showcases how Duo Workflow can transform a tedious coding task into a streamlined process that saves you time and mental energy.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1081627484?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Automate tedious coding tasks with GitLab Duo Workflow&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>The challenge: Implementing a new lint rule</h2>\n<p>In this demo, we tackle a common scenario that many developers face: implementing a new lint rule and then updating multiple files across the codebase to comply with this rule. The specific issue involves validation errors occurring in several project files that need to be addressed consistently.</p>\n<p>Rather than manually identifying and modifying each affected file one by one – a process that could take hours depending on the size of your codebase – we'll see how Duo Workflow can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Read and understand the details from an issue</li>\n<li>Analyze the project structure to identify affected files</li>\n<li>Create a comprehensive plan to implement the necessary changes</li>\n<li>Draft a new lint rule to prevent future occurrences</li>\n<li>Make consistent code changes across all relevant files</li>\n<li>Stage the changes for your review before any commits are made</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A simple prompt initiates the process:</p>\n<p>&quot;Read through issue #1 in this project and submit code changes to resolve it. Be sure to look at each tool file and make all appropriate changes.&quot;</p>\n<p>From there, Duo Workflow takes over – reading the issue, analyzing the files, creating a plan, and implementing the solution – all while keeping me informed of its progress and reasoning.</p>\n<h2>Why this matters for your development process</h2>\n<p>What's particularly powerful about Duo Workflow is how it maintains awareness of this wider context throughout the entire process. It's not just making text replacements based on a large language model's training data – it's understanding the code, making intelligent decisions, and proposing a complete solution that you maintain full control over.</p>\n<p>This approach offers several key benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consistency in implementation:</strong> Apply changes uniformly across files</li>\n<li><strong>Time savings:</strong> Focus your energy on creative problem-solving rather than repetitive tasks</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced context switching:</strong> Complete complex tasks without leaving your IDE</li>\n<li><strong>Keeping a human in the loop:</strong> Review all proposed modifications before committing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Workflow is part of our work to bring AI-powered capabilities to every stage of the software development lifecycle. While this demo focuses on code editing, the same approach can be applied to various development tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementing new features based on issue descriptions</li>\n<li>Fixing bugs with comprehensive test coverage</li>\n<li>Refactoring legacy code to modern standards</li>\n<li>Creating documentation from codebase analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We believe that by automating repetitive tasks, Duo Workflow helps you focus on what matters most – solving interesting problems and creating innovative solutions for your users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GitLab Duo Workflow is currently available in private beta for GitLab Ultimate customers. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/workflow/\">Sign up for the waitlist today!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/10/use-gitlab-duo-workflow-to-improve-application-quality-assurance/\">Use GitLab Duo Workflow to improve application quality assurance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/04/23/solving-complex-challenges-with-gitlab-duo-workflow/\">Solving complex challenges with GitLab Duo Workflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/02/24/gitlab-duo-workflow-enterprise-visibility-and-control-for-agentic-ai/\">GitLab Duo Workflow: Enterprise visibility and control for agentic AI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/the-source/ai/emerging-agentic-ai-trends-reshaping-software-development/\">Emerging agentic AI trends reshaping software development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/agentic-ai/\">What is agentic AI?</a></li>\n</ul>",

You can read my <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/01/22/guide-to-fulfilling-soc-2-security-requirements-with-gitlab/\">Guide to fulfilling SOC 2 security requirements with GitLab</a> to learn more.</p>\n<p>Now, let's review a practical example of using a Custom Compliance Framework to verify SOC2 security compliance, which requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>implementation of controls to protect against unauthorized access</li>\n<li>establishment of procedures for identifying and mitigating risks</li>\n<li>setting up systems for detecting and addressing security incidents</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is only an example showcasing some of the controls possible for adhering to SOC2. Be sure to consult with your security/compliance team before moving any implementation to production.</p>\n<p>A Custom Compliance Framework for SOC2 will look as follows using some GitLab OOTB controls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> SOC2 Security Requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> Adds the security requirements for SOC2 framework compliance</li>\n<li><strong>Requirements:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Implement controls to protect against unauthorized access</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Auth SSO enabled</li>\n<li>CI/CD job token scope enabled</li>\n<li>Require MFA at org level</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Establish procedures for identifying and mitigating risks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>At least two approvals</li>\n<li>Author approved merge request</li>\n<li>Committers approved merge request</li>\n<li>Default branch protected</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Setting up systems for detecting and addressing security incidents</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Dependency Scanning running</li>\n<li>SAST running</li>\n<li>DAST running</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When applied to your project(s), this framework allows you to oversee if/and when they fall out of compliance and what can be done to bring them back into compliance. Note that you can create and apply multiple compliance frameworks to a project(s). For example, you can have one for SOC2 process integrity requirements.</p>\n<h2>Implement security policies to ensure compliance requirements are met</h2>\n<p>Although not required, security policies can be applied to projects containing a Custom Compliance Framework. This allows you to assure that certain compliance criteria will be enforced via security policies. For example, you can force security scanners to run on projects that contain a Custom Compliance Framework requiring security scanning.</p>\n<p>GitLab provides various different security policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/scan_execution_policies/\">Scan execution policy</a>: Enforces security scans, either as part of the pipeline or on a specified schedule.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/merge_request_approval_policies/\">Merge request approval policy</a>: Enforces project-level settings and approval rules based on scan results.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies/\">Pipeline execution policy</a>: Enforces CI/CD jobs as part of project pipelines.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/vulnerability_management_policy/\">Vulnerability management policy</a>: Automatically resolves vulnerabilities that are no longer detected in the default branch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s go ahead and force a SAST scanner to run in order to automatically adhere to any requirements that require SAST scanning. To create a security policy and apply it to a project with a particular framework:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to a project that has a Custom Compliance Framework requiring <strong>SAST scanning</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the sidebar, select <strong>Secure &gt; Policies</strong>.</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>New policy</strong> button.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Scan execution policy</strong>, press the <strong>Select policy</strong> button.</li>\n<li>Fill in the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Actions</strong>, select <strong>SAST</strong> as the scan to run.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Actions screen\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/74d3G21BB1pb2FN80c8iAA/b923f2a6553de21f10f0e05733c5bca8/image8.png\" /></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Under <strong>Conditions</strong>, select the pipeline to be triggered when a pipeline runs for all branches.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Conditions screen\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5O5ig8QKe9iRA6ILQpV9Qy/beda5ee1b50ca562e7eb73080671bf12/image1.png\" /></p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Press the <strong>Configure with a merge request</strong> button.</li>\n<li>An MR is now created in a separate project containing all the security policies scoped to this project.</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Merge</strong> button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now SAST will run for every branch, assuring you are compliant in that area. Be sure to review all the different types of security policies and see how they can suit your requirements.</p>\n<h2>5 best practices to follow</h2>\n<p>To maximize the value of Custom Compliance Frameworks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start small:</strong> Begin with one critical regulation or standard before expanding.</li>\n<li><strong>Involve key stakeholders:</strong> Include compliance, security, and development teams in framework creation.</li>\n<li><strong>Automate where possible:</strong> Use GitLab CI/CD to automate compliance checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Document thoroughly:</strong> Maintain clear documentation of how your framework maps to regulatory requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Review regularly:</strong> Update your frameworks as regulations evolve or new requirements emerge.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Get started today</h2>\n<p>GitLab Custom Compliance Frameworks represent a significant advancement in DevSecOps by bringing compliance directly into the development workflow. By implementing custom frameworks, organizations can reduce compliance overhead, improve risk management, and accelerate development cycles while maintaining robust compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>The ability to define and enforce Custom Compliance Frameworks gives teams the flexibility they need to address their specific regulatory landscape while providing the structure necessary to ensure consistent compliance practices across the organization.</p>\n<p>As regulatory requirements continue to grow in complexity, tools like GitLab Custom Compliance Frameworks will become increasingly essential for organizations looking to balance compliance requirements with development velocity in a sustainable way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To try Custom Compliance Frameworks today, sign up for your <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">free, 60-day trial of GitLab Ultimate</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Learn more</h2>\n<p>Visit these resources to learn more about Custom Compliance Frameworks and how they can benefit your organization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_center/compliance_status_report/\">Custom Compliance Frameworks documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13295\">Custom Compliance Frameworks epic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/\">Security Policies documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/security-compliance/\">GitLab Security and Compliance solutions</a></li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<p>Imagine a workflow where every code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed to your users. That's the power of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/\">Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)</a>! CI/CD helps you catch bugs early, ensures code quality, and delivers software faster and more frequently.</p>\n<h3>What is CI/CD?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Continuous Integration</strong> is a development practice where developers integrate code changes into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration is then verified by an automated build and test process, allowing teams to detect problems early.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> extends CI by automating the release pipeline, ensuring that your code is <em>always</em> in a deployable state. You can deploy your application to various environments (e.g., staging, production) with a single click or automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> takes it a step further by automatically deploying <em>every successful build</em> to production. This requires a high degree of confidence in your automated tests and deployment process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why GitLab CI/CD?</h3>\n<p>GitLab CI/CD is a powerful, integrated system that comes built-in with GitLab. It offers a seamless experience for automating your entire software development lifecycle. With GitLab CI/CD, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automate everything:</strong> Build, test, and deploy your applications with ease.</li>\n<li><strong>Catch bugs early:</strong> Detect and fix errors before they reach production.</li>\n<li><strong>Get faster feedback:</strong> Receive immediate feedback on your code changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve collaboration:</strong> Work together more effectively with automated workflows.</li>\n<li><strong>Accelerate delivery:</strong> Release software faster and more frequently.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce risk:</strong> Minimize deployment errors and rollbacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The elements of GitLab CI/CD</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code><strong>:</strong> This <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/\">YAML file</a>, located in your project's root directory, defines your CI/CD pipeline, including stages, jobs, and runners.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/\"><strong>GitLab Runner</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This agent executes your CI/CD jobs on your infrastructure (e.g. physical machines, virtual machines, Docker containers, or Kubernetes clusters).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#stages\"><strong>Stages</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Stages define the order of execution for your jobs (e.g. build, test, and deploy).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#job-keywords\"><strong>Jobs</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Jobs are individual units of work within a stage (e.g. compile code, run tests, and deploy to staging).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Setting up GitLab CI</h3>\n<p>Getting started with GitLab CI is simple. Here's a basic example of a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - deploy\n\nbuild_job:\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Building the application...&quot;\n\ntest_job:\n  stage: test\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Running tests...&quot;\n\ndeploy_job:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Deploying to production...&quot;\n  environment:\n    name: production\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>This configuration defines three stages: &quot;build,&quot; &quot;test,&quot; and &quot;deploy.&quot; Each stage contains a job that executes a simple script.</p>\n<h3>CI/CD configuration examples</h3>\n<p>Let's explore some more realistic examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Building and deploying a Node.js application</strong></p>\n<p>The pipeline definition below outlines using npm to build and test a Node.js application and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/examples/deployment/\">dpl</a> to deploy the application to Heroku. The deploy stage of the pipeline makes use of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/variables/\">GitLab CI/CD variables</a>, which allow developers to store sensitive information (e.g. credentials) and securely use them in CI/CD processes. In this example, an API key to deploy to Heroku is stored under the variable key name <code>$HEROKU_API_KEY</code> used by the dpl tool.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - deploy\n\nbuild:\n  stage: build\n  image: node:latest\n  script:\n    - npm install\n    - npm run build\n\ntest:\n  stage: test\n  image: node:latest\n  script:\n    - npm run test\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  image: ruby:latest\n  script:\n    - gem install dpl\n    - dpl --provider=heroku --app=$HEROKU_APP_NAME --api-key=$HEROKU_API_KEY\n\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Deploying to different environments (staging and production)</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab also offers the idea of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/environments/\">Environments</a> with CI/CD. This feature allows users to track deployments from CI/CD to infrastructure targets. In the example below, the pipeline adds stages with an environment property for a staging and production environment. While the deploy_staging stage will always run its script, the deploy_production stage requires manual approval to prevent accidental deployment to production.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - deploy_staging\n  - deploy_production\n\nbuild:\n  # ...\n\ntest:\n  # ...\n\ndeploy_staging:\n  stage: deploy_staging\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Deploying to staging...&quot;\n  environment:\n    name: staging\n\ndeploy_production:\n  stage: deploy_production\n  script:\n    - echo &quot;Deploying to production...&quot;\n  environment:\n    name: production\n  when: manual  # Requires manual approval\n\n</code></pre>\n<h3>GitLab Auto DevOps</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/\">GitLab Auto DevOps</a> simplifies CI/CD by providing a pre-defined configuration that automatically builds, tests, and deploys your applications. It leverages best practices and industry standards to streamline your workflow.</p>\n<p>To enable Auto DevOps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your project's <strong>Settings &gt; CI/CD &gt; General pipelines</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enable the <strong>Auto DevOps</strong> option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Auto DevOps automatically detects your project's language and framework and configures the necessary build, test, and deployment stages. You don’t even need to create a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>\n<h3>CI/CD Catalog</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/08/01/faq-gitlab-ci-cd-catalog/\">CI/CD Catalog</a> is a list of projects with published <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/\">CI/CD components</a> you can use to extend your CI/CD workflow. Anyone can create a component project and add it to the CI/CD Catalog or contribute to an existing project to improve the available components. You can find published components in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog\">CI/CD Catalog</a> on GitLab.com.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/11/12/tutorial-how-to-set-up-your-first-gitlab-ci-cd-component/\">Tutorial: How to set up your first GitLab CI/CD component</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>CI templates</h3>\n<p>You can also create your own <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/\">CI templates</a> to standardize and reuse CI/CD configurations across multiple projects. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication.</p>\n<p>To create a CI template:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file in a dedicated project or repository.</li>\n<li>Define your CI/CD configuration in the template.</li>\n<li>In your project's <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file, use the <code>include</code> keyword to include the template.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Take your development to the next level</h2>\n<p>GitLab CI/CD is a powerful tool that can transform your development workflow. By understanding the concepts of CI/CD, configuring your pipelines, and leveraging features like Auto DevOps, the CI/CD Catalog, and CI templates, you can automate your entire software development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Want to take your learning to the next level?

      "summary": "<p>As a Customer Success Manager (CSM), I often face complex challenges that require quick, efficient, and innovative solutions. Recently, one of my enterprise customers encountered an issue with Helm chart limits in the GitLab package registry. At GitLab, we are committed to dogfooding our DevSecOps platform, so I turned to <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/workflow/\">GitLab Duo Workflow</a>, our secure, agentic AI offering that is currently in private beta.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/agentic-ai/\">Agentic AI</a> represents the next evolution of generative AI, designed to go beyond single-task automation, such as code completion or test generation. While generative AI focuses on creating content based on specific prompts, agentic AI introduces a level of autonomy and context awareness, enabling it to perform complex, multi-step workflows. This advanced AI operates as a capable assistant that understands the broader goals of a task, plans intermediate steps, and executes them efficiently.</p>\n<p>Agentic AI, more specifically Duo Workflow, has transformed how I approach problem-solving as a CSM. Here's how I used Duo Workflow to resolve a real-world challenge and deliver value to my customer.</p>\n<h2>Addressing Helm chart limits in the GitLab package registry</h2>\n<p>The customer was dealing with a hardcoded limit for Helm charts in the GitLab package registry, which wasn’t flexible enough for their needs. They required a solution that allowed administrators to configure limits dynamically through the Admin UI. Addressing this issue was critical to maintaining their workflow efficiency and satisfaction.</p>\n<h3>How I leveraged GitLab Duo Workflow</h3>\n<p>To craft an effective solution, I leveraged Duo Workflow, a game-changer for brainstorming and strategizing with agentic AI.</p>\n<p>My prompt was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am working on the following issue [insert issue number] and would like to resolve it. We have developed the following strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Implement the feature as an application setting in the Admin UI, rather than using a configuration file approach.</li>\n<li>Utilize the existing package_registry jsonb column in the application settings table. Add a new key to this JSON structure to store the Helm chart limit.</li>\n<li>Create a new section in the Admin UI (/admin/application_settings/ci_cd#js-package-settings) for “specific limits for each format”. This will require some design work to determine how to best display the setting.</li>\n<li>Add a number field in this new section to allow administrators to set the Helm chart limit.</li>\n<li>Update the backend logic in the Helm package registry (app/finders/packages/helm/packages_finder.rb) to use this new application setting instead of the hardcoded limit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please organize your updates into Frontend and Backend changes. Additionally, could you check if there are any specific requirements when adding a new column to the application settings table?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This prompt laid out a clear plan, enabling Duo Workflow to provide structured recommendations and actionable insights. The strategy developed was straightforward yet impactful. The changes were structured into frontend and backend tasks, ensuring clear separation and collaboration.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Result of GitLab Duo Workflow prompt\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/1hA1avL1LIbKwOtFSKnP7A/4a67ac8d1dd760ffb8a7b511d7a3f730/image3.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Result of GitLab Duo Workflow prompt - 2\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/4T3arBMYhH3KoTMERxSkD1/7ed884cb8dc29ca862d662ade24deb2d/image2.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>After implementing the solution together with Duo Workflow, I submitted a merge request, which was successfully merged and became available in GitLab 17.10!</p>\n<p>The result? A flexible, user-friendly way for administrators to configure Helm chart limits, significantly enhancing the customer’s experience and aligning with their operational goals.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab package registry page\" src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/r9o86ar0p03f/5RtTU6D8ilXevmP1joXkmH/8cd269aa8adfcd767b3e2a3298b7c2e5/image1.png\" /></p>\n<p>The customer is thrilled to have this functionality available as it provides them with the flexibility and control they need to streamline their workflows. What’s even more exciting is that it only took me <strong>hours</strong> to complete the implementation, compared to the <strong>days</strong> I initially estimated, thanks to Duo Workflow. As someone without prior development experience in GitLab, this was a huge win!</p>\n<p>This experience taught me the immense potential of AI tools like <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>. By combining human expertise with AI-driven insights, we can address even the most complex challenges effectively.

CI/CD job token - “Limit access from your project” setting removal</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>In GitLab 14.4, we introduced a setting to <strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#limit-your-projects-job-token-access\">limit access <em>from</em> your project's CI/CD job tokens (CI_JOB_TOKEN)</a></strong> for added security. This setting was called <strong>Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access</strong>. In GitLab 16.3, we renamed this setting <strong>Limit access <em>from</em> this project</strong> for clarity.</p>\n<p>In GitLab 15.9, we introduced an alternative setting called <strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist\">Authorized groups and projects</a></strong>. This setting controls job token access to your project by using an allowlist. This new setting is a significant improvement over the original. The first iteration was deprecated in GitLab 16.0 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 18.0.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Limit access <em>from</em> this project</strong> setting is disabled by default for all new projects. In GitLab 16.0 and later, you cannot re-enable this setting after it is disabled in any project. Instead, use the <strong>Authorized groups and projects</strong> setting to control job token access to your projects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#cicd-job-token---limit-access-from-your-project-setting-removal\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/gitlab-detective/-/blob/main/README.md\">GitLab Detective check available</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. CI/CD job token - Authorized groups and projects allowlist enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>With the <strong><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist\">Authorized groups and projects setting</a></strong> introduced in GitLab 15.9 (renamed from <strong>Limit access to this project</strong> in GitLab 16.3), you can manage CI/CD job token access to your project. When set to <strong>Only this project and any groups and projects in the allowlist</strong>, only groups or projects added to the allowlist can use job tokens to access your project.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prior to GitLab 15.9</strong>, the allowlist was disabled by default (<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#allow-any-project-to-access-your-project\"><strong>All groups and projects</strong></a> access setting selected), allowing job token access from any project.</li>\n<li><strong>Since GitLab 17.6</strong>, administrators for GitLab Self-Managed and Dedicated instances have had the option to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/continuous_integration.html#job-token-permissions\"><strong>enforce a more secure setting for all projects</strong></a>, which prevents project maintainers from selecting <strong>All groups and projects</strong>. This change ensures a higher level of security between projects.</li>\n<li>In GitLab 18.0, this setting will be enabled by default. On GitLab.com, we will automatically populate your projects’ allowlists based on your project authentication logs.</li>\n<li>To prepare for this change on <strong>GitLab.com</strong>, project maintainers using the job token for cross-project authentication should populate their project's <strong>Authorized groups and projects</strong> allowlists. They should then change the setting to <strong>Only</strong> <strong>this project and any groups and projects in the allowlist</strong>. We encourage the use of available <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#auto-populate-a-projects-allowlist\">migration tooling</a> to <em><strong>automate</strong></em> the creation of the allowlist based on the project’s <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#job-token-authentication-log\">authentication logs</a> prior to GitLab 18.0.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Managed users</strong> should populate the allowlists before completing the 18.0 upgrade.</li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated users</strong> should work with their GitLab account team to develop the appropriate strategy for their specific instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#cicd-job-token---authorized-groups-and-projects-allowlist-enforcement\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/jobs/ci_job_token/#add-a-gr\">Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/gitlab-detective/-/blob/main/README.md\">GitLab Detective check available</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Dependency Proxy token scope enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>The Dependency Proxy for containers accepts <strong><code>docker login</code></strong> and <strong><code>docker pull</code></strong> requests using <strong>personal, project,</strong> or <strong>group</strong> access tokens without validating their scopes.</p>\n<p>In GitLab 18.0, the Dependency Proxy will require both <strong><code>read_registry</code></strong> and <strong><code>write_registry</code></strong> scopes for authentication. After this change, authentication attempts using tokens without these scopes will be <strong>rejected</strong>.</p>\n<p>Before upgrading, create new access tokens with the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#authenticate-with-the-dependency-proxy-for-container-images\"><strong>required scopes</strong></a>, and update your workflow variables and scripts with these new tokens.</p>\n<p>You also have the option to use <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/dependancy-token-checker/\"><strong>Dependency Token Checker</strong></a>, a community-developed script that allows you to view tokens and rotate them automatically.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#dependency-proxy-token-scope-enforcement\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Medium impact</h3>\n<p><strong>1. New data retention limits for vulnerabilities on GitLab.com</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com - <strong>Ultimate tier customers only</strong></p>\n<p>Starting in GitLab 18.1 with a phased six-month rollout, we will be introducing a <strong>new data retention limit</strong> for GitLab.com <strong>Ultimate</strong> customers to improve system performance and reliability. The data retention limit affects how long your vulnerability data is stored.</p>\n<p>Vulnerabilities older than 12 months that have not been updated will be automatically moved to cold storage archives. These archives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remain accessible and downloadable through the GitLab UI</li>\n<li>Are retained for 3 years</li>\n<li>Are permanently deleted after 3 years</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#new-data-retention-limits-for-vulnerabilities-on-gitlabcom\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/records-retention-deletion/\">Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Reject container image pull policies not in <code>allowed_pull_policies</code></strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>All configured pull policies should be present in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker/#allow-docker-pull-policies\"><strong>allowed_pull_policies configuration</strong></a> specified in the runner's <strong><code>config.toml</code></strong> file. If they are not, the job should fail with an <strong><code>incompatible pull policy</code></strong> error.</p>\n<p>In the current implementation, when multiple pull policies are defined, jobs pass if at least one pull policy matches those in <strong><code>allowed-pull-policies</code></strong>, even if other policies are not included.</p>\n<p>In GitLab 18.0, jobs will fail only if none of the pull policies match those in <strong><code>allowed-pull-policies</code></strong>. However, unlike past behavior, jobs will use only the pull policies listed in <strong><code>allowed-pull-policies</code></strong>. This distinction can cause jobs that currently pass to fail in GitLab 18.0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#reject-container-image-pull-policies-not-in-allowed_pull_policies\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker/#allow-docker-pull-policies\">Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. PostgreSQL 14 and 15 no longer supported</strong></p>\n<p>Self-Managed</p>\n<p>GitLab follows an <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/data-access/database-framework/postgresql-upgrade-cadence/\"><strong>annual upgrade cadence for PostgreSQL</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Support for PostgreSQL 14 and 15 is scheduled for removal in GitLab 18.0. In GitLab 18.0, PostgreSQL 16 becomes the minimum required version of PostgreSQL.</p>\n<p>PostgreSQL 14 and 15 will be supported for the full GitLab 17 release cycle. PostgreSQL 16 will also be supported for instances that want to upgrade prior to GitLab 18.0.</p>\n<p>To prepare for this change on instances that don't use <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover/\"><strong>PostgreSQL Cluster</strong></a> (for example, if you are running a single PostgreSQL instance you installed with an Omnibus Linux package), upgrades to GitLab 17.11 will attempt to automatically upgrade PostgreSQL to Version 16. If you use <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover/\"><strong>PostgreSQL Cluster</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#opt-out-of-automatic-postgresql-upgrades\"><strong>opt out of this automated upgrade</strong></a>, you must <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server\"><strong>manually upgrade to PostgreSQL 16</strong></a> to be able to upgrade to GitLab 18.0. Make sure you have sufficient disk space to accommodate the upgrade.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#postgresql-14-and-15-no-longer-supported\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database/#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server\">Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/development/managing-postgresql-versions/\">Migration guidelines</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Deprecate the Terraform CI/CD templates</strong></p>\n<p>Self-Managed</p>\n<p>The Terraform CI/CD templates are deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 18.0. This affects the following templates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml</code></li>\n<li><code>Terraform.latest.gitlab-ci.yml</code></li>\n<li><code>Terraform/Base.gitlab-ci.yml</code></li>\n<li><code>Terraform/Base.latest.gitlab-ci.yml</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitLab won't be able to update the <strong><code>terraform</code></strong> binary in the job images to any version that is licensed under the BSL.</p>\n<p>To continue using Terraform, clone the templates and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-images\"><strong>Terraform image</strong></a>, and maintain them as needed. GitLab provides <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-images\"><strong>detailed instructions</strong></a> for migrating to a custom-built image.</p>\n<p><strong>As an alternative, we recommend using the new OpenTofu CI/CD component on GitLab.com or the new OpenTofu CI/CD template on GitLab Self-Managed.</strong> CI/CD components are not yet available on GitLab Self-Managed, however, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415638\"><strong>Issue #415638</strong></a> proposes adding this feature. If CI/CD components become available on GitLab Self-Managed, the OpenTofu CI/CD template will be removed.</p>\n<p>Read more about the new <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/components/opentofu\">OpenTofu CI/CD component</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#deprecate-terraform-cicd-templates\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Major update of the Prometheus subchart</strong></p>\n<p>Self-Managed</p>\n<p>With GitLab 18.0 and GitLab chart 9.0, the Prometheus subchart will be updated from 15.3 to 27.3.</p>\n<p>Along with this update, Prometheus 3 will be shipped by default.</p>\n<p>Manual steps are required to perform the upgrade. If you have Alertmanager, Node Exporter, or Pushgateway enabled, you will also need to update your Helm values.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/9_0/#prometheus-upgrade\"><strong>migration guide</strong></a> for more information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#major-update-of-the-prometheus-subchart\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Low impact</h3>\n<p><strong>1. No longer building SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 packages</strong></p>\n<p>Self-Managed</p>\n<p>Long-term service and support (LTSS) for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 15 SP2 ended in December 2024.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we will no longer support the SLES SP2 distribution for Linux package installs. You should upgrade to SLES 15 SP6 for continued support.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#support-for-suse-linux-enterprise-server-15-sp2\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Remove Gitaly rate limiter</strong></p>\n<p>Self-Managed</p>\n<p>Gitaly used to support <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/4b7ea24f6172a03e7989879200b47b6fd0e2d059/doc/backpressure.md#L55-55\"><strong>RPC-based rate limiting</strong></a>. We are deprecating this feature as it does not achieve the desired results. Please see the deprecation issue for details.</p>\n<p>If customers have the rate limiter configured (which is being deprecated), no error will be returned and the config will simply be ignored.</p>\n<p>Customers should utilize the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitaly/concurrency_limiting/\"><strong>Concurrency Limiter</strong></a> instead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#gitaly-rate-limiting\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Deprecate NGINX controller image 1.3.1 support</strong></p>\n<p>Self-Managed</p>\n<p>We're upgrading the default NGINX controller image to 1.11.2. This new version requires new RBAC rules and some users set <strong>nginx-ingress.rbac.create: false</strong> to manage their own RBAC rules.</p>\n<p>These users will need to add the RBAC rules before migrating to 1.11.2 or later. We added a fallback mechanism to only deploy 1.3.1 if this Helm value is set as above. We've also added <strong>nginx-ingress.controller.image.disableFallback</strong>, which defaults to false. Users who manage their own RBAC can set this to true to enable their deployments to also use 1.11.2, after ensuring the new RBAC rules are in place.</p>\n<p>We plan to deprecate the 1.3.1 image support as well as the fallback mechanism as part of 17.5, so that we can remove this support completely and use only 1.11.2, which offers numerous security benefits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#fallback-support-for-gitlab-nginx-chart-controller-image-v131\">Deprecation notice</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Application Security Testing analyzers major version update</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>The Application Security Testing stage will be bumping the major versions of its analyzers in tandem with the GitLab 18.0 release.</p>\n<p>If you are not using the default included templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions, you must update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or update the latest major version.</p>\n<p>Users of GitLab 17.0-17.11 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the release of GitLab 18.0. After GitLab 18.0, all newly fixed bugs and features will be released only in the new major version of the analyzers.</p>\n<p>We do not backport bugs and features to deprecated versions as per our maintenance policy. As required, security patches will be backported to the latest three minor releases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#application-security-testing-analyzers-major-version-update\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. API Discovery will use branch pipelines by default</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>In GitLab 18.0, we'll update the default behavior of the CI/CD template for API Discovery (<strong>API-Discovery.gitlab-ci.yml</strong>).</p>\n<p>Before GitLab 18.0, this template configures jobs to run in <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/merge_request_pipelines/\"><strong>merge request pipelines</strong></a> by default when an MR is open.</p>\n<p>Starting in GitLab 18.0, we'll align this template's behavior with the behavior of the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/detect/roll_out_security_scanning/#template-editions\"><strong>Stable template editions</strong></a> for other AST scanners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default, the template will run scan jobs in branch pipelines.</li>\n<li>You'll be able to set the CI/CD variable <strong>AST_ENABLE_MR_PIPELINES: true</strong> to use MR pipelines instead when an MR is open. The implementation of this new variable is tracked in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410880\"><strong>Issue #410880</strong></a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#api-discovery-will-use-branch-pipelines-by-default\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>6. DAST DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT will have a lower default value</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab.com | Self-Managed | Dedicated</p>\n<p>The <strong>DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT</strong> environment variable determines how long a DAST scan waits for a response from the browser. Before GitLab 18.0, the variable has a static value of 45 seconds. After GitLab 18.0, <strong>DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT</strong> environment variable has a dynamic value, which is calculated based on other timeout configurations.</p>\n<p>In most cases, the 45-second value was higher than the timeout value of many scanner functions. The dynamically calculated value makes the <strong>DAST_DEVTOOLS_API_TIMEOUT</strong> variable more useful by increasing the number of cases to which it applies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/update/deprecations/#dast-dast_devtools_api_timeout-will-have-a-lower-default-value\">Deprecation notice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tools and resources to manage your impact</h2>\n<p>We’ve developed specific tooling to help our customers understand how these planned changes impact their GitLab instance(s). Once you’ve assessed your impact, we recommend reviewing the mitigation steps provided in the documentation to ensure a smooth transition to GitLab 18.0.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/deprecation-migration-tools/advanced-search-deprecations\">Advanced Search Deprecations</a>: This tool uses GitLab's Advanced Search API to find strings related to deprecations across GitLab groups and projects.

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're excited to announce the general availability of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/aws/\">GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</a>, delivering agentic AI throughout the software development lifecycle for AWS customers. GitLab Duo with Amazon Q, based on GitLab Ultimate, includes many familiar features such as code completion, code explanation, code generation, chat, and vulnerability explanation and resolution – all of which are now powered by Amazon Q. It is available with a Self-Managed deployment model for customers on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>\n<p>With Amazon Q's agents directly embedded into GitLab's DevSecOps platform, developers maintain their familiar development environment while gaining powerful AI capabilities. The result is a frictionless experience that helps accelerate development cycles, reduce manual effort, and enhance code quality.</p>\n<p>“Participating in the early access program for GitLab Duo with Amazon Q has given us a glimpse into its transformative potential for our development workflows,” said Osmar Alonso, DevOps Engineer, Volkswagen Digital Solutions. “Even in its early stages, we saw how the deeper integration with autonomous agents could streamline our process, from code commit to production. We're excited to see how this technology empowers our team to focus on innovation and accelerate our digital transformation.&quot;</p>\n<h2>Agentic AI comes to complex customer environments</h2>\n<p>By combining agentic AI with secure, reliable cloud infrastructure, GitLab and AWS bring built-in security, scale, and reliability to complex customer environments, enabling them to realize the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Unified developer experience for streamlined development</strong></p>\n<p>Developers can interact with Amazon Q through the GitLab Duo Chat interface from their preferred IDE or the GitLab web interface. This eliminates the need for context switching in other tools and helps developers stay focused on the project that they’re working on.</p>\n<p><strong>One solution for the entire software development lifecycle</strong></p>\n<p>Code suggestions and optimizations leverage AWS-specific patterns and practices, while testing tools understand AWS service interactions and dependencies. A common data store across all stages provides essential context to AI agents, enabling complete visibility and traceability for relevant actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure development with enterprise-grade guardrails</strong></p>\n<p>End-to-end security and compliance are built directly into the development platform with guardrails that help reduce risk without impeding velocity. This secure software development approach enforces transparency and auditability through AI agents while seamlessly integrating with AWS security services and compliance frameworks.</p>\n<h2>How to start using GitLab Duo with Amazon Q</h2>\n<p>Here are five initial use cases we’re targeting to help teams build secure software faster with agentic AI:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Feature development acceleration</strong> - Create issue descriptions, generate implementation plans based on your existing codebase, and produce complete merge requests ready for review. This drives feature delivery acceleration while maintaining consistency with internal development standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Legacy application modernization</strong> - Analyze your legacy Java codebase, create a comprehensive upgrade plan, and generate a merge request with all necessary code changes. This unlocks faster Java upgrade time, while providing a clear audit trail of all code transformations. Support for .NET and other languages is planned for future releases.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality assurance enhancement</strong> - Analyze code and automatically create comprehensive unit tests that understand your application logic and AWS service interactions. This increases test coverage, reduces manual test writing effort, and helps ensure consistent test quality across applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Code review optimization</strong> - Provide inline feedback on code changes, suggesting improvements based on development standards, highlighting security and performance considerations. This enables reduced code review cycles and delivery of higher-quality code merges for deployment.</li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerability remediation</strong> - Explain detected vulnerabilities in clear, detailed terms and one-click remediation based on recommended code changes, helping to significantly reduce the time from detection to remediation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Watch GitLab Duo with Amazon Q in action:</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075753390?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Technical Demo: GitLab Duo with Amazon Q&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Get the benefits of GitLab Duo with Amazon Q today</h4>\n<p>GitLab's unified, AI-powered DevSecOps platform with Amazon Q's advanced AI capabilities provides AWS customers with a solution that transforms how teams build and deploy software.

Here are a few reasons we recommend examining your cloud setup regularly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>They support business growth: As your business evolves, your cloud infrastructure must evolve with it. A cloud architecture review helps you align your current environment with your business goals, helping to ensure your cloud is positioned to support where you are today, where you’re heading, and the outcomes you need to achieve.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They improve performance and security: Regular reviews can find hidden problems that can slow you down or make you less secure. Downtime isn’t just inconvenient, it’s costly. A strong, resilient cloud architecture helps you avoid downtime and keeps your business running smoothly, no matter what comes your way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They help you save on costs: Cloud reviews can help you make sure your setup is running as cost-efficiently as possible and that you’re getting your money’s worth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\">Tips to boost cloud performance and security</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-boost-cloud-performance-and-security\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Optimizing cloud performance and security is about delivering faster user experiences, protecting sensitive data, and avoiding waste. Whether you’re scaling your app or managing costs, a well-tuned cloud setup gives you speed, stability, and peace of mind. Here are five things you can check to make your cloud faster, more reliable and better protected:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Audit your virtual machines and Kubernetes nodes: Many businesses use more virtual machines or Kubernetes nodes than they need. This wastes money. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-droplet-vm\">Choose the right  virtual machines</a> and Kubernetes node pools to make sure they match how much you’re using. If you find machines that aren’t being used much, make them smaller or move workloads to a smaller instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use load balancers and autoscaling: Traffic to your business can change quickly. If you have too much infrastructure, you waste money. If you have too little, your app will run poorly. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/autoscale-workloads-using-droplet-autoscale-pools\">Autoscaling</a> adjusts your infrastructure based on traffic. This way, you don’t pay for resources you don’t need, and your app runs well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Streamline networking with VPCs: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/vpc-vs-vpn\">Virtual private clouds</a> (VPCs) can make internal communication faster and cheaper. VPCs also improve security by keeping your traffic away from the public internet. Set up VPCs for internal services that talk to each other a lot. This reduces delay and helps protect your internal resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monitor usage and set up alerts: Even with a good setup, problems will happen. Alerts can warn you before small issues become big headaches. Use alerts to track things like CPU usage, memory usage, and data transfers. You can also set up alerts for billing to warn you about unexpected costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Back up smarter: Losing data or taking a long time to recover can hurt your business. Have a good backup plan. Back up your databases and file systems regularly. Automate the backup process and test your restores to make sure they work.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\">Tips to save money and grow efficiently</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#tips-to-save-money-and-grow-efficiently\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Here are five more things you can do to save money and grow your business:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/data-storage-management-strategies\">Consolidate and optimize storage</a>: Unused storage costs money. Check your storage usage regularly to avoid waste. Delete old snapshots and unused disks to free up resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/managed-vs-self-managed-databases\">Use managed services</a>: Running your own databases can take time and introduce errors. Managed services can handle scaling, security, and uptime for you, helping to save you time and money. Migrate any self-hosted databases to managed databases offered by your cloud provider—we recommend DigitalOcean. ;)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automate deployments: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/streamline-deployment-through-ci-cd-on-digitalocean-s-app-platform\">Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</a> (CI/CD) can reduce errors and simplify rollbacks. Infrastructure as code makes your environment easy to reproduce and build on. Use tools like Terraform and GitHub actions to automate your infrastructure and deployments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review data costs: Egress data costs can add up, especially if you use a lot of media or APIs. Find ways to reduce unnecessary outbound traffic. Use <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/what-is-a-cdn\">CDNs</a> to cache content closer to where your users are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do a monthly cost vs. performance review: Make time each month to review your <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/understand-your-cloud-bill\">cloud bill</a> and performance metrics to help you make sure you’re spending money where it matters most. Track your spending and performance to make informed decisions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\">How DigitalOcean experts help: A real-world example</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#how-digitalocean-experts-help-a-real-world-example\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Similar to many DigitalOcean customers, a mid-sized software company wanted to serve customers globally with low delay and high performance.

DO gave me that from day one. The way the company supported me, especially outside of work, allowed me to show up as my best self every day. Through big transitions like the pandemic, they always put my family first. That support helped me stay grounded and, in turn, empowered me to help others do their best work for our customers.</p>\n<div class=\"callout info\">\n<p>🎥 Have a look at Jason Dobry’s full conversation ⬇️</p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYdh_cnePh4\" target=\"_blank\">View YouTube video</a>\n\n</div>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"what-excites-you-most-about-digitalocean\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-excites-you-most-about-digitalocean\">What excites you most about DigitalOcean?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#what-excites-you-most-about-digitalocean\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Our willingness to experiment. Even if a solution isn’t the perfect fit long term, we aren’t afraid to try it.

I’d only been at DO for about four months, and like many, the transition to working from home was brand new to me. But the way DO handled it was incredible. We had a fast, seamless transition to remote work, and we never missed a beat. During a time when everything felt uncertain, my coworkers became more than just colleagues, they became family. That sense of unity not only helped us get through a tough time, but it also fueled us to deliver some really impactful work at remarkable speed.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"which-of-do-s-values-resonates-most-with-you\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#which-of-do-s-values-resonates-most-with-you\">Which of DO’s values resonates most with you?</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#which-of-do-s-values-resonates-most-with-you\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>What brought me to DO in the first place was a referral from a friend and former colleague, someone who showed me what made this company different from any place I’d worked before. In my past roles at other companies, the mindset was often “just get it done,” no matter the personal cost. But at DO, I found a clear mission, supportive teammates, and a culture that actually prioritizes sustainable success. That focus and the drive to keep building with people who think about the future is what keeps me here today.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"dive-into-the-future-with-digitalocean\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#dive-into-the-future-with-digitalocean\">Dive into the future with DigitalOcean</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#dive-into-the-future-with-digitalocean\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>At DigitalOcean, our customers and community are at the heart of everything we do.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>.

We see opportunities for better performance and ease of use by only deprecating those configurations, setting smarter defaults and encouraging more best practices.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 sets the stage for us to bring the next generation of features along with performance and scalability improvements the community hungers for.</p><p>This release will improve UX, security and performance by:</p><ol><li>Introducing additional recommended configurations out of the box, thus reducing required effort to achieve more secure and performant Argo CD configurations</li><li>Dropping support for legacy configuration options, that we discourage using</li></ol><p>With time and community feedback, we realized that certain <em>optional</em> configurations should in fact be the <em>default</em>, since many users explicitly configure those. One such example would be some performance-related configurations.</p><p>This release will also address long-existing technical debt, caused by supporting legacy configurations we started with when Argo CD was young, and which we no longer recommend on using, as Argo CD had matured.</p><h3><strong>What Is Changing in This Version?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/milestone/27?closed=1\">Here</a> is a non-exhaustive list of changes in this release, among those:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19768\">Removal</a> of support for legacy argocd-cm repository config</li><li>Enabling fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19988\">by default</a></li><li>Making applyNestedSelectors: true the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/14152\">default and only</a> option for matrix/merge generators</li><li>Having an <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">opinion</a> on secrets — while we remained un-opinionated regarding secret management with Argo CD since day 1, maintainability and security lessons learned surfaced the need to be better aligned with the industry in this domain</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21207\">Preventing</a> the usage of in-cluster, when in-cluster is explicitly disabled</li></ol><h3>Backwards Compatibility &amp; Migration</h3><p>We aim for v3 release to be so inoffensive, that upgrading to 3.0 is almost as easy as upgrading between 2.x minor versions has been.</p><p>For each change, the documentation will contain clear description of:</p><ol><li>What the change is</li><li>How to determine whether the user is affected by the change (i.e which command to run)</li><li>How to migrate</li><li>For relatively high-risk changes - how to opt out (i.e switch back to the old default)</li></ol><h3>Get Involved</h3><p>You can read the full proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21422\">here</a>.

With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates.

We have explained how plugins work in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-rollouts-1-5-release-candidate-2bd93720e411\">the release announcement</a>.</p><p>The second one is the new Kubernetes Gateway API.</p><h3>The Gateway API — a unified standard for service meshes and ingresses in Kubernetes</h3><p>The Gateway API is a Kubernetes SIG project that unifies all networking solutions of Kubernetes under a common umbrella adding several features missing from the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">basic Ingress API</a> while at the same time incorporating all the service mesh solutions.</p><p>You can think of the gateway API as the next generation of the Kubernetes Ingress API, as well as the next generation of the (<a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/10/03/cncf-archives-the-service-mesh-interface-smi-project/\">now retired</a>) <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/projects/service-mesh-interface-smi/\">SMI standard</a>.</p><p>The Kubernetes Gateway API is notable because it now defines a clear separation between people defining the infrastructure vs people using the infrastructure.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l6pMy712SHGuNkDgl2tFtA.png\" /><figcaption>Gateway API resource model</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, it has the unanimous support of all major networking vendors. Most networking solutions have either added initial support for the Gateway API, or declared that they will follow it.</p><p>You can see the extensive list of supporters of the API at the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementation list</a>.</p><h3>Argo Rollouts and the Gateway API — like jelly and peanut butter</h3><p>Argo Rollouts has now a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/rollouts-plugin-trafficrouter-gatewayapi\">plugin for supporting the Gateway API</a>.

This feature allows you to group information from multiple places (for example a public Helm chart plus your local values file) to form a single Argo CD application. Initial support for defining multiple sources was already added in Argo CD version 2.6, and the support for CLI was added in 2.11. The UI still assumed the application to have a single source and certain CLI features like rollback were not yet supported for an application with multiple sources.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, rollback of a multiple source application is now possible via both Argo CD UI and CLI.</p><p>In addition to the rollback feature, a new Sources tab has been added to the Application Details page, enabling users to manage (view and edit) the sources of an application.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mj0F_f8U8TQMhzvN\" /></figure><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/keithchong\">Keith Chong</a> (Red Hat) and <a href=\"https://github.com/JorTurFer\">Jorge Turrado</a> for implementing these features.</p><h3>Project Scoped Repository Credential Improvements</h3><p>Currently, multiple repository credentials sharing the same URL is not allowed by the Argo CD API. If the credentials are added directly to the argocd namespace, argocd-server won’t return an error, but this still does not work since the first secret that matches a repository URL is the one that gets returned, and the order is also undefined.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, Argo CD will allow multiple app projects to have the ability to have separate repository credentials having the same URL.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">Blake Pettersson</a> (Akuity) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Add labels for Kubernetes events</h3><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, users will be able to expose application labels on k8s events generated by Argo CD. When the events are created for Applications that have specific label keys defined in `resource.includeEventLabelKeys`, the controller will attach the matching labels to the events. This connection will make it simpler to filter or process the events based on the applications using these labels.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/svghadi\">Siddhesh Ghadi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Consistent Sharding Algorithm</h3><p>Argo CD provides the capability to employ sharding for different Argo CD application controllers. This allows you to assign specific clusters to specific controllers to distribute the load across the different shards.</p><p>The existing sharding algorithms, including the legacy method and the round-robin algorithm, have shown limitations in maintaining optimal load distribution and minimizing unnecessary cluster-to-shard assignment changes.</p><p>With Argo CD version 2.12, a new sharding algorithm named “consistent-hashing” is introduced which reduces Cluster-to-Shard Assignment Changes and optimizes resource utilization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/akram\">Akram Ben Aissi</a> (Red Hat) for implementing this feature.</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p>Here are some other new changes that made it into the release</p><ul><li>Updates to git client for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17566\">resolving semantic versioning tags</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/thepabloaguilar\">Pablo Aguilar</a> from Stone Payments)</li><li>Application Set Git Generator now supports <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18545\">GPG signature verification</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/ishitasequeira\">Ishita Sequeira</a> from Red Hat)</li><li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18250\">ls-remote request fail</a> metric (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>)</li><li>Add new<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/pull/560\"> annotation argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Force=true</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/kkk777-7\">Kota Kimura</a> from CyberAgent, Inc.)</li><li>Add support for setting a <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/17728\">grpc message size as an environment variable</a> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pavel Kostohrys</a> from Codefresh)</li><li>Display the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18116\">list of dependent resources</a> in the delete popup (by <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a> from Intuit)</li><li>Remove support for <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/13203\">old tracking label</a> <em>applications.argoproj.io/app-name</em> (by <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">Soumya Ghosh Dastidar</a> from Akuity)</li><li>Add support for<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18484\"> fish shell completion</a> to Argo CD CLI (by <a href=\"https://github.com/Sn0rt\">Sn0rt</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18657\">Skip calling git fetch</a> if the commit to checkout exists locally (by <a href=\"https://github.com/shady-canva\">Shady Rafehi</a>)</li></ul><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.12.0-rc1\">release notes</a>, and <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.11-2.12/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

Please note that <em><code>EnvoyFilter</code> is not currently supported for any existing Istio version with waypoint proxies</em>. While it may be possible to use <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with waypoints in limited scenarios, its use is not supported, and is actively discouraged by the maintainers. The alpha API may break in future releases as it evolves. We expect official support will be provided at a later date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What’s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"customization-of-resources-provisioned-by-the-gateway-api\">Customization of resources provisioned by the Gateway API</h3>\n<p>When you create a Gateway or a waypoint using the Gateway API, a <code>Service</code> and a <code>Deployment</code> are created automatically. It has been a common request to allow customization of these objects, and that is now supported in Istio 1.26 by specifying a <code>ConfigMap</code> of parameters. If configuration for a <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code> or <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code> is provided, those resources will automatically be created also. <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Learn more about customizing the generated Gateway API resources.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"new-gateway-api-support\">New Gateway API support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/tcp/\"><code>TCPRoute</code></a> is now available in waypoints, allowing TCP traffic shifting in ambient mode.</p>\n<p>We also added support for the experimental <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtlspolicy/\"><code>BackendTLSPolicy</code></a> and started the implementation of <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/backendtrafficpolicy/\"><code>BackendTrafficPolicy</code></a> in Gateway API 1.3, which will eventually set retry constraints.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-the-new-kubernetes-clustertrustbundle\">Support for the new Kubernetes <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code></h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve added experimental support for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#cluster-trust-bundles\">the experimental <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> resource in Kubernetes</a>, allowing support for the new method of bundling a certificate and its root of trust into a single object.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plus-much-much-more\">Plus much, much more</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>istioctl analyze</code> can now run specific checks!</li>\n<li>The CNI node agent no longer runs in the <code>hostNetwork</code> namespace by default, reducing the chance of port conflicts with other services running on a host!</li>\n<li>Required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources and <code>cniBinDir</code> values are set automatically when installing on GKE!</li>\n<li>An <code>EnvoyFilter</code> can now match a <code>VirtualHost</code> on a domain name!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read about these and more in the full <a href=\"https://istio.io/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/change-notes/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"catch-up-with-the-istio-project\">Catch up with the Istio project</h2>\n<p>If you only check in with us when we have a new release, you might have missed that <a href=\"https://istio.io/blog/2025/ztunnel-security-assessment/\">we published a security audit on ztunnel</a>, <a href=\"https://istio.io/blog/2025/ambient-performance/\">we compared performance of ambient mode throughput vs. running in-kernel</a>, or that <a href=\"https://istio.io/blog/2025/istio-at-kubecon-eu/\">we had a major presence at KubeCon EU</a>.

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the CNI agent to no longer require <code>hostNetwork</code>, enhancing compatibility. Dynamic switching to the host network is now performed as needed. The previous behavior can be temporarily restored by setting the <code>ambient.shareHostNetworkNamespace</code> field in the <code>istio-cni</code> chart. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54726\">Issue #54726</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> iptables binary detection to validate baseline kernel support and to prefer <code>nft</code> when both legacy and <code>nft</code> are available but neither has existing rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> the default value of maximum connections accepted per socket event to 1 to improve performance. To revert to the previous behavior, set <code>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SOCKET_EVENT_LOOP</code> to zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability for <code>EnvoyFilter</code> to match a <code>VirtualHost</code> by domain name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> initial support for the experimental Gateway API features <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> and <code>XBackendTrafficPolicy</code>. These are disabled by default and require setting <code>PILOT_ENABLE_ALPHA_GATEWAY_API=true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for referencing <code>ConfigMap</code>s, in addition to <code>Secret</code>s, for <code>DestinationRule</code> TLS in <code>SIMPLE</code> mode — useful when only a CA certificate is required.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54131\">Issue #54131</a>), (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54132\">Issue #54132</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> customization support for <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#automated-deployment\">Gateway API automated deployments</a>. This applies to both Istio <code>Gateway</code> types (ingress and egress) and Istio Waypoint <code>Gateway</code> types (ambient waypoints). Users can now customize generated resources such as <code>Service</code>, <code>Deployment</code>, <code>ServiceAccount</code>, <code>HorizontalPodAutoscaler</code>, and <code>PodDisruptionBudget</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new environment variable <code>ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT</code> for <code>istiod</code>. When set to <code>false</code>, it disables automatic attachment of Gateway API resources to existing gateway deployments. By default, this is <code>true</code> to maintain the current behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure retry host predicates using the Retry API (<code>retry_ignore_previous_hosts</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying backoff intervals during retries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for using <code>TCPRoute</code> in waypoint proxies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured a <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where FQDNs did not work in a <code>WorkloadEntry</code> using ambient mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a case where <code>ReferenceGrants</code> did not function when mTLS was enabled on a Gateway listener.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55623\">Issue #55623</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio failed to correctly retrieve <code>allowedRoutes</code> for a sandboxed waypoint.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56010\">Issue #56010</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>ServiceEntry</code> endpoints were leaked when a pod was evicted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54997\">Issue #54997</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the listener address was duplicated for dual stack services with IPv6 priority.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56151\">Issue #56151</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Added</strong> experimental support for the v1alpha1 <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> API. This can be enabled by setting <code>values.pilot.env.ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API=true</code>. Ensure the corresponding feature gates are enabled in your cluster; see <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3257-cluster-trust-bundles\">KEP-3257</a> for details.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/43986\">Issue #43986</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>omit_empty_values</code> field in the <code>EnvoyFileAccessLog</code> provider via the Telemetry API.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54930\">Issue #54930</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> environment variable <code>PILOT_SPAWN_UPSTREAM_SPAN_FOR_GATEWAY</code>, which separates tracing spans for server and client gateways. This currently defaults to <code>false</code>, but will become the default in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a warning message for use of deprecated telemetry providers Lightstep and OpenCensus.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54002\">Issue #54002</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the installation experience on GKE. When <code>global.platform=gke</code> is set, required <code>ResourceQuota</code> resources are deployed automatically. When installing via <code>istioctl</code>, this setting is also auto-enabled if GKE is detected. Additionally, the <code>cniBinDir</code> is now configured appropriately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> the <code>ztunnel</code> Helm chart to not assign resource names to <code>.Release.Name</code>, defaulting instead to <code>ztunnel</code>. This reverts a change introduced in Istio 1.25.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for setting the <code>reinvocationPolicy</code> in the revision-tag webhook when installing Istio via <code>istioctl</code> or Helm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to configure the service <code>loadBalancerClass</code> in the Gateway Helm chart.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/39079\">Issue #39079</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a values <code>ConfigMap</code> that stores both the user-provided Helm values and the merged values after applying profiles for the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for reading header values from <code>istiod</code> environment variables.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53408\">Issue #53408</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a configurable <code>updateStrategy</code> for the <code>ztunnel</code> and <code>istio-cni</code> Helm charts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in the sidecar injection template that incorrectly removed existing init containers when both traffic interception and native sidecar were disabled.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54562\">Issue #54562</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> missing <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> labels on gateway pods when <code>--set networkGateway</code> is used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54909\">Issue #54909</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a problem where setting <code>replicaCount=0</code> in the <code>istio/gateway</code> Helm chart caused the <code>replicas</code> field to be omitted instead of explicitly set to <code>0</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55092\">Issue #55092</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue that caused file-based certificate references (e.g., from <code>DestinationRule</code> or <code>Gateway</code>) to fail when using SPIRE as the CA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> the deprecated <code>ENABLE_AUTO_SNI</code> flag and associated code paths.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"istioctl\">istioctl</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--locality</code> parameter on <code>istioctl experimental workload group create</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54022\">Issue #54022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the ability to run specific analyzer checks using the <code>istioctl analyze</code> command.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a <code>--tls-server-name</code> parameter to <code>istioctl create-remote-secret</code>, allowing the <code>tls-server-name</code> to be set in the generated kubeconfig. This ensures successful TLS connections when the <code>server</code> field is overridden with a gateway proxy hostname.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for the <code>envVarFrom</code> field in the <code>istiod</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl analyze</code> reported an unknown annotation <code>sidecar.istio.io/statsCompression</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52082\">Issue #52082</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an error that blocked installation when <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> or <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways.label</code> was omitted.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>istioctl</code> ignored the <code>tag</code> fields under <code>IstioOperator.components.gateways.ingressGateways</code> and <code>egressGateways</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54955\">Issue #54955</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl waypoint delete</code> could remove a non-waypoint Gateway resource when a name was specified.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55235\">Issue #55235</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl experimental describe</code> did not respect the <code>--namespace</code> flag.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55243\">Issue #55243</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug that prevented simultaneous generation of <code>istio.io/waypoint-for</code> and <code>istio.io/rev</code> labels when creating a waypoint proxy using <code>istioctl</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55437\">Issue #55437</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>istioctl admin log</code> could not modify the log level for <code>ingress status</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55741\">Issue #55741</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a validation failure when <code>reconcileIptablesOnStartup: true</code> was set in the <code>istioctl</code> YAML configuration.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55347\">Issue #55347</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

when HTTP <code>ext_proc</code> processes local replies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of Istio, this CVE is only exploitable in circumstances where <code>ext_proc</code> is configured via <code>EnvoyFilter</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes\">Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where customizing the workload identity SDS socket name\nvia <code>WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_SOCKET_FILE</code> did not work due to the Envoy bootstrap not being updated.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/51979\">Issue #51979</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istiod fails with an LDS error for proxies &lt;1.23 when <code>meshConfig.accessLogEncoding</code> is set to <code>JSON</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55116\">Issue #55116</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>gateway</code> injection template did not respect the <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-logs-container</code>\nand <code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container</code> annotations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where validation webhook would reject an otherwise valid <code>connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409\">Issue #55409</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the validation webhook incorrectly reported a warning when a <code>ServiceEntry</code> configured <code>workloadSelector</code> with DNS resolution.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/50164\">Issue #50164</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) to now be affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>. Before, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the 1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

resulted in stale RDS.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/49638\">Issue #49638</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Ambient <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policies were overly strict.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53884\">Issue #53884</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> failure to patch managed gateway/waypoint deployments during upgrade to 1.24.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54145\">Issue #54145</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug in where multiple <code>STRICT</code> port-level mTLS rules in an ambient mode <code>PeerAuthentication</code> policy would effectively result\nin a permissive policy due to incorrect evaluation logic (AND vs. OR).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54146\">Issue #54146</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> the wording of the status message when L7 rules are present in an AuthorizationPolicy which is bound to ztunnel, to be clearer.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54334\">Issue #54334</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the request mirror filter incorrectly computed the percentage.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54357\">Issue #54357</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where using a tag in the

#54458</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where out-of-order ztunnel disconnects could put <code>istio-cni</code> in a state where it believes it has no connections.\n(<a

where access log order caused instability during connection draining.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54672\">Issue #54672</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the gateway chart where <code>--set platform</code> worked but <code>--set global.platform</code> did not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways did not use WDS discovery to retrieve metadata for ambient mode destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the <code>istio-iptables</code> command to fail when a non-built-in table is present in the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing configuration to be rejected when there is a partial overlap between IP addresses across multiple services.\nFor example, a Service with <code>[IP-A]</code> and one with <code>[IP-B, IP-A]</code>.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/52847\">Issue #52847</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> DNS traffic (UDP and TCP) is now affected by traffic annotations like <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundIPRanges</code> and <code>traffic.sidecar.istio.io/excludeOutboundPorts</code>.\nBefore, UDP/DNS traffic would uniquely ignore these traffic annotations, even if a DNS port was specified, because of the rule structure. The behavior change actually happened in the\n1.23 release series, but was left out of the release notes for 1.23.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53949\">Issue #53949</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> validation webhook rejecting an otherwise valid configuration <code>connectionPool.tcp.IdleTimeout=0s</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55409\">Issue #55409</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-early-days\">The early days<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-early-days\" name=\"the-early-days\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yace-gains-momentum\">Yace Gains Momentum<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#yace-gains-momentum\" name=\"yace-gains-momentum\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\">Gratitude and Future Vision<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#gratitude-and-future-vision\" name=\"gratitude-and-future-vision\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"try-out-yace-on-your-own\">Try out YACE on your own<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#try-out-yace-on-your-own\" name=\"try-out-yace-on-your-own\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

Prometheus has come a long way in that time, \nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to \ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-new\">What's New<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-new\" name=\"whats-new\"></a>\n</h1>\n<div class=\"toc toc-right\"><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\">New UI\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\">OTLP Support\n</a></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\">Native Histograms\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes\n</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-ui\">New UI<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#new-ui\" name=\"new-ui\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please \n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"remote-write-2-0\">Remote Write 2.0<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write-2-0\" name=\"remote-write-2-0\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. \nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"utf-8-support\">UTF-8 Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\" name=\"utf-8-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"otlp-support\">OTLP Support<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-support\" name=\"otlp-support\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features \nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion\">OTLP Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion\" name=\"otlp-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"utf-8-normalization\">UTF-8 Normalization<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-normalization\" name=\"utf-8-normalization\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:%7E:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"native-histograms\">Native Histograms<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-histograms\" name=\"native-histograms\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#breaking-changes\" name=\"breaking-changes\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"performance\">Performance<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#performance\" name=\"performance\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a> \nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"whats-next\">What's Next<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#whats-next\" name=\"whats-next\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and… \nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong>\n</li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 class=\"page-header\" id=\"try-it-out\">Try It Out!<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#try-it-out\" name=\"try-it-out\"></a>\n</h1>\n\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"looking-back-at-2023\">Looking back at 2023<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#looking-back-at-2023\" name=\"looking-back-at-2023\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-year-ahead\">The year ahead<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-year-ahead\" name=\"the-year-ahead\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\">OTLP Ingestion GA<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-ingestion-ga\" name=\"otlp-ingestion-ga\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\">Support UTF-8 metric and label names<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\" name=\"support-utf-8-metric-and-label-names\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\">Native support for resource attributes<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#native-support-for-resource-attributes\" name=\"native-support-for-resource-attributes\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\">OTLP export in the ecosystem<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\" name=\"otlp-export-in-the-ecosystem\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"delta-temporality\">Delta temporality<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#delta-temporality\" name=\"delta-temporality\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"call-for-contributions\">Call for contributions!<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#call-for-contributions\" name=\"call-for-contributions\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-didnt-you-go-for-a-feature-flag-that-we-can-toggle\">Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#why-didnt-you-go-for-a-feature-flag-that-we-can-toggle\" name=\"why-didnt-you-go-for-a-feature-flag-that-we-can-toggle\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it.

To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-is-the-release-v2-43-0-stringlabels-and-the-docker-tag-v2-43-0-stringlabels\">Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#why-is-the-release-v2-43-0-stringlabels-and-the-docker-tag-v2-43-0-stringlabels\" name=\"why-is-the-release-v2-43-0-stringlabels-and-the-docker-tag-v2-43-0-stringlabels\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-other-noticeable-features-in-the-prometheus-2-43-release\">What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#what-are-the-other-noticeable-features-in-the-prometheus-2-43-release\" name=\"what-are-the-other-noticeable-features-in-the-prometheus-2-43-release\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements.

CNCF Ambassador and tech lead for the CNCF TAG Observability. In his free time, he writes a book titled \"Efficient Go\" with O'Reilly. Opinions are my own!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I personally love in the Prometheus project, and one of the many reasons why I joined the team, was the laser focus on the project's goals. Prometheus was always about pushing boundaries when it comes to providing pragmatic, reliable, cheap, yet invaluable metric-based monitoring. Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\">History of the Forwarding Use Case<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\" name=\"history-of-the-forwarding-use-case\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (: </p>\n\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"remote-write\">Remote Write<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#remote-write\" name=\"remote-write\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-remote-write-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"prometheus-agent-mode\">Prometheus Agent Mode<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#prometheus-agent-mode\" name=\"prometheus-agent-mode\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition-wrapper note\"><div class=\"admonition alert alert-info\">\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</div></div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\">The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\" name=\"the-dream-auto-scalable-metric-ingestion\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\">Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\" name=\"agent-mode-was-proven-at-scale\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\">How to Use Agent Mode in Detail<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\" name=\"how-to-use-agent-mode-in-detail\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">usage: prometheus [&lt;flags&gt;]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\">Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\" name=\"hands-on-prometheus-agent-example-katacoda-tutorial\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary<a class=\"header-anchor ti ti-link\" href=\"https://prometheus.io/#summary\" name=\"summary\"></a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
