      "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 10:30:00 -0800",
      "summary": "<p>With the release of Kubernetes 1.34, a new alpha feature is introduced\nthat gives you more granular control over container restarts within a Pod. This\nfeature, named <strong>Container Restart Policy and Rules</strong>, allows you to specify a\nrestart policy for each container individually, overriding the Pod's global\nrestart policy. In addition, it also allows you to conditionally restart\nindividual containers based on their exit codes. This feature is available\nbehind the alpha feature gate <code>ContainerRestartRules</code>.</p>\n<p>This has been a long-requested feature. Let's dive into how it works and how you\ncan use it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-with-a-single-restart-policy\">The problem with a single restart policy</h2>\n<p>Before this feature, the <code>restartPolicy</code> was set at the Pod level. This meant\nthat all containers in a Pod shared the same restart policy (<code>Always</code>,\n<code>OnFailure</code>, or <code>Never</code>). While this works for many use cases, it can be\nlimiting in others.</p>\n<p>For example, consider a Pod with a main application container and an init\ncontainer that performs some initial setup. You might want the main container\nto always restart on failure, but the init container should only run once and\nnever restart. With a single Pod-level restart policy, this wasn't possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-per-container-restart-policies\">Introducing per-container restart policies</h2>\n<p>With the new <code>ContainerRestartRules</code> feature gate, you can now specify a\n<code>restartPolicy</code> for each container in your Pod's spec. You can also define\n<code>restartPolicyRules</code> to control restarts based on exit codes. This gives you\nthe fine-grained control you need to handle complex scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-cases\">Use cases</h2>\n<p>Let's look at some real-life use cases where per-container restart policies can\nbe beneficial.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-place-restarts-for-training-jobs\">In-place restarts for training jobs</h3>\n<p>In ML research, it's common to orchestrate a large number of long-running AI/ML\ntraining workloads. In these scenarios, workload failures are unavoidable. When\na workload fails with a retriable exit code, you want the container to restart\nquickly without rescheduling the entire Pod, which consumes a significant amount\nof time and resources. Restarting the failed container &quot;in-place&quot; is critical\nfor better utilization of compute resources. The container should only restart\n&quot;in-place&quot; if it failed due to a retriable error; otherwise, the container and\nPod should terminate and possibly be rescheduled.</p>\n<p>This can now be achieved with container-level <code>restartPolicyRules</code>. The workload\ncan exit with different codes to represent retriable and non-retriable errors.\nWith <code>restartPolicyRules</code>, the workload can be restarted in-place quickly, but\nonly when the error is retriable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"try-once-init-containers\">Try-once init containers</h3>\n<p>Init containers are often used to perform initialization work for the main\ncontainer, such as setting up environments and credentials. Sometimes, you want\nthe main container to always be restarted, but you don't want to retry\ninitialization if it fails.</p>\n<p>With a container-level <code>restartPolicy</code>, this is now possible. The init container\ncan be executed only once, and its failure would be considered a Pod failure. If\nthe initialization succeeds, the main container can be always restarted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pods-with-multiple-containers\">Pods with multiple containers</h3>\n<p>For Pods that run multiple containers, you might have different restart\nrequirements for each container. Some containers might have a clear definition\nof success and should only be restarted on failure. Others might need to be\nalways restarted.</p>\n<p>This is now possible with a container-level <code>restartPolicy</code>, allowing individual\ncontainers to have different restart policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-it\">How to use it</h2>\n<p>To use this new feature, you need to enable the <code>ContainerRestartRules</code> feature\ngate on your Kubernetes cluster control-plane and worker nodes running\nKubernetes 1.34+. Once enabled, you can specify the <code>restartPolicy</code> and\n<code>restartPolicyRules</code> fields in your container definitions.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-1-restarting-on-specific-exit-codes\">Example 1: Restarting on specific exit codes</h3>\n<p>In this example, the container should restart if and only if it fails with a\nretriable error, represented by exit code 42.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, the container has <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>, and a restart\npolicy rule that tells Kubernetes to restart the container in-place if it exits\nwith code 42.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

Or maybe, you'd like to have custom aliases defined,\nbut not necessarily <a href=\"https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases\">generate hundreds of them manually</a>?\nLook no further. <a href=\"https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-cli/\">SIG-CLI</a>\nhas been working hard to add <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">user preferences to kubectl</a>,\nand we are happy to announce that this functionality is reaching beta as part\nof the Kubernetes v1.34 release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>A full description of this functionality is available <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kuberc/\">in our official documentation</a>,\nbut this blog post will answer both of the questions from the beginning of this\narticle.</p>\n<p>Before we dive into details, let's quickly cover what the user preferences file\nlooks like and where to place it. By default, <code>kubectl</code> will look for <code>kuberc</code>\nfile in your default <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/\">kubeconfig</a>\ndirectory, which is <code>$HOME/.kube</code>. Alternatively, you can specify this location\nusing <code>--kuberc</code> option or the <code>KUBERC</code> environment variable.</p>\n<p>Just like every Kubernetes manifest, <code>kuberc</code> file will start with an <code>apiVersion</code>\nand <code>kind</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>kubectl.config.k8s.io/v1beta1<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>Preference<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># the user preferences will follow here</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"defaults\">Defaults</h3>\n<p>Let's start by setting default values for <code>kubectl</code> command options. Our goal\nis to always use interactive delete, which means we want the <code>--interactive</code>\noption for <code>kubectl delete</code> to always be set to <code>true</code>. This can be achieved\nwith the following addition to our <code>kuberc</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">defaults</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>delete<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">options</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>interactive<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"true\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the above example, I'm introducing <code>defaults</code> section, which allows users to\ndefine default values for <code>kubectl</code> options. In this case, we're setting the\ninteractive option for <code>kubectl delete</code> to be <code>true</code> by default. This default\ncan be overridden if a user explicitly provides a different value such as\n<code>kubectl delete --interactive=false</code>, in which case the explicit option takes\nprecedence.</p>\n<p>Another highly encouraged default from SIG-CLI, is using <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">Server-Side Apply</a>.\nTo do so, you can add the following snippet to your preferences:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># continuing defaults section</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>apply<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">options</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>server-side<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"true\"</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id=\"aliases\">Aliases</h3>\n<p>The ability to define aliases allows us to save precious seconds when typing\ncommands. I bet that you most likely have one defined for <code>kubectl</code>, because\ntyping seven letters is definitely longer than just pressing <code>k</code>.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the ability to define aliases was a must-have when we decided\nto implement user preferences, alongside defaulting. To define an alias for any\nof the built-in commands, expand your <code>kuberc</code> file with the following addition:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">aliases</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>gns<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>get<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">prependArgs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- namespace<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">options</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>output<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>json<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>There's a lot going on above, so let me break this down. First, we're introducing\na new section: <code>aliases</code>. Here, we're defining a new alias <code>gns</code>, which is mapped\nto the command <code>get</code> command. Next, we're defining arguments (<code>namespace</code> resource)\nthat will be inserted right after the command name. Additionally, we're setting\n<code>--output=json</code> option for this alias. The structure of <code>options</code> block is identical\nto the one in the <code>defaults</code> section.</p>\n<p>You probably noticed that we've introduced a mechanism for prepending arguments,\nand you might wonder if there is a complementary setting for appending them (in\nother words, adding to the end of the command, after user-provided arguments).\nThis can be achieved through <code>appendArgs</code> block, which is presented below:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #080; font-style: italic;\"># continuing aliases section</span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"></span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>runx<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">command</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>run<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">options</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>image<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>busybox<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- <span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">name</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>namespace<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">default</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>test-ns<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #008000; font-weight: bold;\">appendArgs</span>:<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- --<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #bbb;\"> </span>- custom-arg<span style=\"color: #bbb;\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, we're introducing another alias: <code>runx</code>, which invokes <code>kubectl run</code> command,\npassing <code>--image</code> and <code>--namespace</code> options with predefined values, and also\nappending <code>--</code> and <code>custom-arg</code> at the end of the invocation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"debugging\">Debugging</h2>\n<p>We hope that <code>kubectl</code> user preferences will open up new possibilities for our users.\nWhenever you're in doubt, feel free to run <code>kubectl</code> with increased verbosity.\nAt <code>-v=5</code>, you should get all the possible debugging information from this feature,\nwhich will be crucial when reporting issues.</p>\n<p>To learn more, I encourage you to read through <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kuberc/\">our official documentation</a>\nand the <a href=\"https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-cli/3104-introduce-kuberc/README.md\">actual proposal</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved</h2>\n<p>Kubectl user preferences feature has reached beta, and we are very interested\nin your feedback.

Of those enhancements, 23 have graduated to Stable, 22 have entered Beta, and 13 have entered Alpha.</p>\n<p>There are also some <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/feed.xml#deprecations-and-removals\">deprecations and removals</a> in this release; make sure to read about those.</p>\n<h2 id=\"release-theme-and-logo\">Release theme and logo</h2>\n<figure class=\"release-logo \">\n<img alt=\"Kubernetes v1.34 logo: Three bears sail a wooden ship with a flag featuring a paw and a helm symbol on the sail, as wind blows across the ocean\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/27/kubernetes-v1-34-release/k8s-v1.34.png\" />\n</figure>\n<p>A release powered by the wind around us — and the will within us.</p>\n<p>Every release cycle, we inherit winds that we don't really control — the state\nof our tooling, documentation, and the historical quirks of our project.\nSometimes these winds fill our sails, sometimes they push us sideways or die\ndown.</p>\n<p>What keeps Kubernetes moving isn't the perfect winds, but the will of our\nsailors who adjust the sails, man the helm, chart the courses and keep the ship\nsteady. The release happens not because conditions are always ideal, but because\nof the people who build it, the people who release it, and the bears<sup>\n^</sup>, cats, dogs, wizards, and curious minds who keep Kubernetes sailing\nstrong — no matter which way the wind blows.</p>\n<p>This release, <strong>Of Wind &amp; Will (O' WaW)</strong>, honors the winds that have shaped us,\nand the will that propels us forward.</p>\n<p><sub>^ Oh, and you wonder why bears? Keep wondering!</sub></p>\n<h2 id=\"spotlight-on-key-updates\">Spotlight on key updates</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.34 is packed with new features and improvements. Here are a few select updates the Release Team would like to highlight!</p>\n<h3 id=\"stable-the-core-of-dra-is-ga\">Stable: The core of DRA is GA</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/\">Dynamic Resource Allocation</a> (DRA)\nenables more powerful ways to select, allocate, share, and configure\nGPUs, TPUs, NICs and other devices.</p>\n<p>Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using\n<em>structured parameters</em> that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes.\nThis enhancement took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.\nDRA with structured parameters relies on a set of supporting API kinds:\nResourceClaim, DeviceClass, ResourceClaimTemplate, and ResourceSlice API types\nunder <code>resource.k8s.io</code>, while extending the <code>.spec</code> for Pods with a new <code>resourceClaims</code> field.<br />\nThe <code>resource.k8s.io/v1</code> APIs have graduated to stable and are now available by default.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4381\">KEP #4381</a> led by WG Device Management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beta-projected-serviceaccount-tokens-for-kubelet-image-credential-providers\">Beta: Projected ServiceAccount tokens for <code>kubelet</code> image credential providers</h3>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> credential providers, used for pulling private container images, traditionally relied on long-lived Secrets stored on the node or in the cluster. This approach increased security risks and management overhead, as these credentials were not tied to the specific workload and did not rotate automatically.<br />\nTo solve this, the <code>kubelet</code> can now request short-lived, audience-bound ServiceAccount tokens for authenticating to container registries. This allows image pulls to be authorized based on the Pod's own identity rather than a node-level credential.<br />\nThe primary benefit is a significant security improvement. It eliminates the need for long-lived Secrets for image pulls, reducing the attack surface and simplifying credential management for both administrators and developers.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4412\">KEP #4412</a> led by SIG Auth and SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alpha-support-for-kyaml-a-kubernetes-dialect-of-yaml\">Alpha: Support for KYAML, a Kubernetes dialect of YAML</h3>\n<p>KYAML aims to be a safer and less ambiguous YAML subset, and was designed specifically for Kubernetes. Whatever version of Kubernetes you use, starting from Kubernetes v1.34 you are able to use KYAML as a new output format for kubectl.</p>\n<p>KYAML addresses specific challenges with both YAML and JSON. YAML's significant whitespace requires careful attention to indentation and nesting, while its optional string-quoting can lead to unexpected type coercion (for example: <a href=\"https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/\">&quot;The Norway Bug&quot;</a>). Meanwhile, JSON lacks comment support and has strict requirements for trailing commas and quoted keys.</p>\n<p>You can write KYAML and pass it as an input to any version of <code>kubectl</code>, because all KYAML files are also valid as YAML. With <code>kubectl</code> v1.34, you are also able to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/#syntax-1\">request KYAML output</a> (as in kubectl get -o kyaml …) by setting environment variable <code>KUBECTL_KYAML=true</code>. If you prefer, you can still request the output in JSON or YAML format.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5295\">KEP #5295</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-graduating-to-stable\">Features graduating to Stable</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now stable following the v1.34 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"delayed-creation-of-job-s-replacement-pods\">Delayed creation of Job’s replacement Pods</h3>\n<p>By default, Job controllers create replacement Pods immediately when a Pod starts terminating, causing both Pods to run simultaneously. This can cause resource contention in constrained clusters, where the replacement Pod may struggle to find available nodes until the original Pod fully terminates. The situation can also trigger unwanted cluster autoscaler scale-ups.\nAdditionally, some machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and <a href=\"https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">JAX</a> require only one Pod per index to run at a time, making simultaneous Pod execution problematic.\nThis feature introduces <code>.spec.podReplacementPolicy</code> in Jobs. You may choose to create replacement Pods only when the Pod is fully terminated (has <code>.status.phase: Failed</code>). To do this, set <code>.spec.podReplacementPolicy: Failed</code>.<br />\nIntroduced as alpha in v1.28, this feature has graduated to stable in v1.34.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3939\">KEP #3939</a> led by SIG Apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recovery-from-volume-expansion-failure\">Recovery from volume expansion failure</h3>\n<p>This feature allows users to cancel volume expansions that are unsupported by the underlying storage provider, and retry volume expansion with smaller values that may succeed.<br />\nIntroduced as alpha in v1.23, this feature has graduated to stable in v1.34.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1790\">KEP #1790</a> led by SIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volumeattributesclass-for-volume-modification\">VolumeAttributesClass for volume modification</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/\">VolumeAttributesClass</a> has graduated to stable in v1.34. VolumeAttributesClass is a generic, Kubernetes-native API for modifying volume parameters like provisioned IO. It allows workloads to vertically scale their volumes on-line to balance cost and performance, if supported by their provider.<br />\nLike all new volume features in Kubernetes, this API is implemented via the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/\">container storage interface (CSI)</a>. Your provisioner-specific CSI driver must support the new ModifyVolume API which is the CSI side of this feature.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3751\">KEP #3751</a> led by SIG Storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"structured-authentication-configuration\">Structured authentication configuration</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.29 introduced a configuration file format to manage API server client authentication, moving away from the previous reliance on a large set of command-line options.\nThe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#using-authentication-configuration\">AuthenticationConfiguration</a> kind allows administrators to support multiple JWT authenticators, CEL expression validation, and dynamic reloading.\nThis change significantly improves the manageability and auditability of the cluster's authentication settings - and has graduated to stable in v1.34.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3331\">KEP #3331</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finer-grained-authorization-based-on-selectors\">Finer-grained authorization based on selectors</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes authorizers, including webhook authorizers and the built-in node authorizer, can now make authorization decisions based on field and label selectors in incoming requests. When you send <strong>list</strong>, <strong>watch</strong> or <strong>deletecollection</strong> requests with selectors, the authorization layer can now evaluate access with that additional context.</p>\n<p>For example, you can write an authorization policy that only allows listing Pods bound to a specific <code>.spec.nodeName</code>.\nThe client (perhaps the kubelet on a particular node) must specify\nthe field selector that the policy requires, otherwise the request is forbidden.\nThis change makes it feasible to set up least privilege rules, provided that the client knows how to conform to the restrictions you set.\nKubernetes v1.34 now supports more granular control in environments like per-node isolation or custom multi-tenant setups.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4601\">KEP #4601</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restrict-anonymous-requests-with-fine-grained-controls\">Restrict anonymous requests with fine-grained controls</h3>\n<p>Instead of fully enabling or disabling anonymous access, you can now configure a strict list of endpoints where unauthenticated requests are allowed. This provides a safer alternative for clusters that rely on anonymous access to health or bootstrap endpoints like <code>/healthz</code>, <code>/readyz</code>, or <code>/livez</code>.</p>\n<p>With this feature, accidental RBAC misconfigurations that grant broad access to anonymous users can be avoided without requiring changes to external probes or bootstrapping tools.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4633\">KEP #4633</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-efficient-requeueing-through-plugin-specific-callbacks\">More efficient requeueing through plugin-specific callbacks</h3>\n<p>The <code>kube-scheduler</code> can now make more accurate decisions about when to retry scheduling Pods that were previously unschedulable. Each scheduling plugin can now register callback functions that tell the scheduler whether an incoming cluster event is likely to make a rejected Pod schedulable again.</p>\n<p>This reduces unnecessary retries and improves overall scheduling throughput - especially in clusters using dynamic resource allocation. The feature also lets certain plugins skip the usual backoff delay when it is safe to do so, making scheduling faster in specific cases.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4247\">KEP #4247</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ordered-namespace-deletion\">Ordered Namespace deletion</h3>\n<p>Semi-random resource deletion order can create security gaps or unintended behavior, such as Pods persisting after their associated NetworkPolicies are deleted.<br />\nThis improvement introduces a more structured deletion process for Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/\">namespaces</a> to ensure secure and deterministic resource removal. By enforcing a structured deletion sequence that respects logical and security dependencies, this approach ensures Pods are removed before other resources.<br />\nThis feature was introduced in Kubernetes v1.33 and graduated to stable in v1.34. The graduation improves security and reliability by mitigating risks from non-deterministic deletions, including the vulnerability described in <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r56h-j38w-hrqq\">CVE-2024-7598</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5080\">KEP #5080</a> led by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"streaming-list-responses\">Streaming <strong>list</strong> responses</h3>\n<p>Handling large <strong>list</strong> responses in Kubernetes previously posed a significant scalability challenge. When clients requested extensive resource lists, such as thousands of Pods or Custom Resources, the API server was required to serialize the entire collection of objects into a single, large memory buffer before sending it. This process created substantial memory pressure and could lead to performance degradation, impacting the overall stability of the cluster.<br />\nTo address this limitation, a streaming encoding mechanism for collections (list responses)\nhas been introduced. For the JSON and Kubernetes Protobuf response formats, that streaming mechanism\nis automatically active and the associated feature gate is stable.\nThe primary benefit of this approach is the avoidance of large memory allocations on the API server, resulting in a much smaller and more predictable memory footprint.\nConsequently, the cluster becomes more resilient and performant, especially in large-scale environments where frequent requests for extensive resource lists are common.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5116\">KEP #5116</a> led by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resilient-watch-cache-initialization\">Resilient watch cache initialization</h3>\n<p>Watch cache is a caching layer inside <code>kube-apiserver</code> that maintains an eventually consistent cache of cluster state stored in etcd. In the past, issues could occur when the watch cache was not yet initialized during <code>kube-apiserver</code> startup or when it required re-initialization.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, the watch cache initialization process has been made more resilient to failures, improving control plane robustness and ensuring controllers and clients can reliably establish watches. This improvement was introduced as beta in v1.31 and is now stable.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4568\">KEP #4568</a> led by SIG API Machinery and SIG Scalability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"relaxing-dns-search-path-validation\">Relaxing DNS search path validation</h3>\n<p>Previously, the strict validation of a Pod's DNS <code>search</code> path in Kubernetes often created integration challenges in complex or legacy network environments. This restrictiveness could block configurations that were necessary for an organization's infrastructure, forcing administrators to implement difficult workarounds.<br />\nTo address this, relaxed DNS validation was introduced as alpha in v1.32 and has now graduated to stable in v1.34. A common use case involves Pods that need to communicate with both internal Kubernetes services and external domains. By setting a single dot (<code>.</code>) as the first entry in the <code>searches</code> list of the Pod's <code>.spec.dnsConfig</code>, administrators can prevent the system's resolver from appending the cluster's internal search domains to external queries. This avoids generating unnecessary DNS requests to the internal DNS server for external hostnames, improving efficiency and preventing potential resolution errors.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4427\">KEP #4427</a> led by SIG Network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-direct-service-return-dsr-in-windows-kube-proxy\">Support for Direct Service Return (DSR) in Windows <code>kube-proxy</code></h3>\n<p>DSR provides performance optimizations by allowing return traffic routed through load balancers to bypass the load balancer and respond directly to the client, reducing load on the load balancer and improving overall latency. For information on DSR on Windows, read <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/networkingblog/direct-server-return-dsr-in-a-nutshell/693710\">Direct Server Return (DSR) in a nutshell</a>.<br />\nInitially introduced in v1.14, this feature has graduated to stable in v1.34.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5100\">KEP #5100</a> led by SIG Windows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sleep-action-for-container-lifecycle-hooks\">Sleep action for Container lifecycle hooks</h3>\n<p>A Sleep action for containers’ PreStop and PostStart lifecycle hooks was introduced to provide a straightforward way to manage graceful shutdowns and improve overall container lifecycle management.<br />\nThe Sleep action allows containers to pause for a specified duration after starting or before termination. Using a negative or zero sleep duration returns immediately, resulting in a no-op.<br />\nThe Sleep action was introduced in Kubernetes v1.29, with zero value support added in v1.32. Both features graduated to stable in v1.34.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3960\">KEP #3960</a> and <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4818\">KEP #4818</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linux-node-swap-support\">Linux node swap support</h3>\n<p>Historically, the lack of swap support in Kubernetes could lead to workload instability, as nodes under memory pressure often had to terminate processes abruptly. This particularly affected applications with large but infrequently accessed memory footprints and prevented more graceful resource management.</p>\n<p>To address this, configurable per-node swap support was introduced in v1.22. It has progressed through alpha and beta stages and has graduated to stable in v1.34. The primary mode, <code>LimitedSwap</code>, allows Pods to use swap within their existing memory limits, providing a direct solution to the problem. By default, the <code>kubelet</code> is configured with <code>NoSwap</code> mode, which means Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap.</p>\n<p>This feature improves workload stability and allows for more efficient resource utilization. It enables clusters to support a wider variety of applications, especially in resource-constrained environments, though administrators must consider the potential performance impact of swapping.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2400\">KEP #2400</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"allow-special-characters-in-environment-variables\">Allow special characters in environment variables</h3>\n<p>The environment variable validation rules in Kubernetes have been relaxed\nto allow nearly all printable ASCII characters in variable names, excluding <code>=</code>.\nThis change supports scenarios where workloads require nonstandard characters in variable names - for example, frameworks like .NET Core that use <code>:</code> to represent nested configuration keys.</p>\n<p>The relaxed validation applies to environment variables defined directly in Pod spec,\nas well as those injected using <code>envFrom</code> references to ConfigMaps and Secrets.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4369\">KEP #4369</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"taint-management-is-separated-from-node-lifecycle\">Taint management is separated from Node lifecycle</h3>\n<p>Historically, the <code>TaintManager</code>'s logic for applying NoSchedule and NoExecute taints to nodes based on their condition (NotReady, Unreachable, etc.) was tightly coupled with the node lifecycle controller. This tight coupling made the code harder to maintain and test, and it also limited the flexibility of the taint-based eviction mechanism.\nThis KEP refactors the <code>TaintManager</code> into its own separate controller within the Kubernetes controller manager. It is an internal architectural improvement designed to increase code modularity and maintainability. This change allows the logic for taint-based evictions to be tested and evolved independently, but it has no direct user-facing impact on how taints are used.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3902\">KEP #3902</a> led by SIG Scheduling and SIG Node.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-beta\">New features in Beta</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now beta following the v1.34 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-level-resource-requests-and-limits\">Pod-level resource requests and limits</h3>\n<p>Defining resource needs for Pods with multiple containers has been challenging,\nas requests and limits could only be set on a per-container basis.\nThis forced developers to either over-provision resources for each container or meticulously\ndivide the total desired resources, making configuration complex and often leading to\ninefficient resource allocation.\nTo simplify this, the ability to specify resource requests and limits at the Pod level was introduced.\nThis allows developers to define an overall resource budget for a Pod,\nwhich is then shared among its constituent containers.\nThis feature was introduced as alpha in v1.32 and has graduated to beta in v1.34,\nwith HPA now supporting pod-level resource specifications.</p>\n<p>The primary benefit is a more intuitive and straightforward way to manage resources for multi-container Pods.\nIt ensures that the total resources used by all containers do not exceed the Pod's defined limits,\nleading to better resource planning, more accurate scheduling,\nand more efficient utilization of cluster resources.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2837\">KEP #2837</a> led by SIG Scheduling and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kuberc-file-for-kubectl-user-preferences\"><code>.kuberc</code> file for <code>kubectl</code> user preferences</h3>\n<p>A <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file allows you to define preferences for <code>kubectl</code>, such as default options and command aliases. Unlike the kubeconfig file, the <code>.kuberc</code> configuration file does not contain cluster details, usernames or passwords.<br />\nThis feature was introduced as alpha in v1.33, gated behind the environment variable <code>KUBECTL_KUBERC</code>. It has graduated to beta in v1.34 and is enabled by default.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3104\">KEP #3104</a> led by SIG CLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"external-serviceaccount-token-signing\">External ServiceAccount token signing</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, Kubernetes manages ServiceAccount tokens using static signing keys that are loaded from disk at <code>kube-apiserver</code> startup. This feature introduces an <code>ExternalJWTSigner</code> gRPC service for out-of-process signing, enabling Kubernetes distributions to integrate with external key management solutions (for example, HSMs, cloud KMSes) for ServiceAccount token signing instead of static disk-based keys.</p>\n<p>Introduced as alpha in v1.32, this external JWT signing capability advances to beta and is enabled by default in v1.34.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/740\">KEP #740</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-features-in-beta\">DRA features in beta</h3>\n<h4 id=\"admin-access-for-secure-resource-monitoring\">Admin access for secure resource monitoring</h4>\n<p>DRA supports controlled administrative access via the <code>adminAccess</code> field in ResourceClaims or ResourceClaimTemplates, allowing cluster operators to access devices already in use by others for monitoring or diagnostics. This privileged mode is limited to users authorized to create such objects in namespaces labeled <code>resource.k8s.io/admin-access: &quot;true&quot;</code>, ensuring regular workloads remain unaffected. Graduating to beta in v1.34, this feature provides secure introspection capabilities while preserving workload isolation through namespace-based authorization checks.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5018\">KEP #5018</a> led by WG Device Management and SIG Auth.</p>\n<h4 id=\"prioritized-alternatives-in-resourceclaims-and-resourceclaimtemplates\">Prioritized alternatives in ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates</h4>\n<p>While a workload might run best on a single high-performance GPU, it might also be able to run on two mid-level GPUs.<br />\nWith the feature gate <code>DRAPrioritizedList</code> (now enabled by default), ResourceClaims and ResourceClaimTemplates get a new field named <code>firstAvailable</code>. This field is an ordered list that allows users to specify that a request may be satisfied in different ways, including allocating nothing at all if specific hardware is not available. The scheduler will attempt to satisfy the alternatives in the list in order, so the workload will be allocated the best set of devices available in the cluster.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4816\">KEP #4816</a> led by WG Device Management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-kubelet-reports-allocated-dra-resources\">The <code>kubelet</code> reports allocated DRA resources</h4>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code>'s API has been updated to report on Pod resources allocated through DRA. This allows node monitoring agents to discover the allocated DRA resources for Pods on a node. Additionally, it enables node components to use the PodResourcesAPI and leverage this DRA information when developing new features and integrations.<br />\nStarting from Kubernetes v1.34, this feature is enabled by default.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3695\">KEP #3695</a> led by WG Device Management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kube-scheduler-non-blocking-api-calls\"><code>kube-scheduler</code> non-blocking API calls</h3>\n<p>The <code>kube-scheduler</code> makes blocking API calls during scheduling cycles, creating performance bottlenecks. This feature introduces asynchronous API handling through a prioritized queue system with request deduplication, allowing the scheduler to continue processing Pods while API operations complete in the background. Key benefits include reduced scheduling latency, prevention of scheduler thread starvation during API delays, and immediate retry capability for unschedulable Pods. The implementation maintains backward compatibility and adds metrics for monitoring pending API operations.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5229\">KEP #5229</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mutating-admission-policies\">Mutating admission policies</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/mutating-admission-policy/\">MutatingAdmissionPolicies</a> offer a declarative, in-process alternative to mutating admission webhooks. This feature leverages CEL's object instantiation and JSON Patch strategies, combined with Server Side Apply’s merge algorithms.<br />\nThis significantly simplifies admission control by allowing administrators to define mutation rules directly in the API server.<br />\nIntroduced as alpha in v1.32, mutating admission policies has graduated to beta in v1.34.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3962\">KEP #3962</a> led by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"snapshottable-api-server-cache\">Snapshottable API server cache</h3>\n<p>The <code>kube-apiserver</code>'s caching mechanism (watch cache) efficiently serves requests for the latest observed state. However, <strong>list</strong> requests for previous states (for example, via pagination or by specifying a <code>resourceVersion</code>) often bypass this cache and are served directly from etcd. This direct etcd access significantly increases performance costs and can lead to stability issues, particularly with large resources, due to memory pressure from transferring large data blobs.<br />\nWith the <code>ListFromCacheSnapshot</code> feature gate enabled by default, <code>kube-apiserver</code> will attempt to serve the response from snapshots if one is available with <code>resourceVersion</code> older than requested. The <code>kube-apiserver</code> starts with no snapshots, creates a new snapshot on every watch event, and keeps them until it detects etcd is compacted or if cache is full with events older than 75 seconds. If the provided <code>resourceVersion</code> is unavailable, the server will fallback to etcd.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4988\">KEP #4988</a> led by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tooling-for-declarative-validation-of-kubernetes-native-types\">Tooling for declarative validation of Kubernetes-native types</h3>\n<p>Prior to this release, validation rules for the\nAPIs built into Kubernetes were written entirely by hand, which makes them difficult for maintainers to discover, understand, improve or test.\nThere was no single way to find all the validation rules that might apply to an API.\n<em>Declarative validation</em> benefits Kubernetes maintainers by making API development, maintenance, and review easier while enabling programmatic inspection for better tooling and documentation.\nFor people using Kubernetes libraries to write their own code\n(for example: a controller), the new approach streamlines adding new fields through IDL tags, rather than complex validation functions.\nThis change helps speed up API creation by automating validation boilerplate,\nand provides more relevant error messages by performing validation on versioned types.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​<br />\nThis enhancement (which graduated to beta in v1.33 and continues as beta in v1.34) brings CEL-based validation rules to native Kubernetes types. It allows for more granular and declarative validation to be defined directly in the type definitions, improving API consistency and developer experience.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5073\">KEP #5073</a> led by SIG API Machinery.</p>\n<h3 id=\"streaming-informers-for-list-requests\">Streaming informers for <strong>list</strong> requests</h3>\n<p>The streaming informers feature, which has been in beta since v1.32, gains further beta refinements in v1.34. This capability allows <strong>list</strong> requests to return data as a continuous stream of objects from the API server’s watch cache, rather than assembling paged results directly from etcd. By reusing the same mechanics used for <strong>watch</strong> operations, the API server can serve large datasets while keeping memory usage steady and avoiding allocation spikes that can affect stability.</p>\n<p>In this release, the <code>kube-apiserver</code> and <code>kube-controller-manager</code> both take advantage of the new <code>WatchList</code> mechanism by default. For the <code>kube-apiserver</code>, this means list requests are streamed more efficiently, while the <code>kube-controller-manager</code> benefits from a more memory-efficient and predictable way to work with informers. Together, these improvements reduce memory pressure during large list operations, and improve reliability under sustained load, making list streaming more predictable and efficient.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3157\">KEP #3157</a> led by SIG API Machinery and SIG Scalability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"graceful-node-shutdown-handling-for-windows-nodes\">Graceful node shutdown handling for Windows nodes</h3>\n<p>The <code>kubelet</code> on Windows nodes can now detect system shutdown events and begin graceful termination of running Pods. This mirrors existing behavior on Linux and helps ensure workloads exit cleanly during planned shutdowns or restarts.<br />\nWhen the system begins shutting down, the <code>kubelet</code> reacts by using standard termination logic. It respects the configured lifecycle hooks and grace periods, giving Pods time to stop before the node powers off. The feature relies on Windows pre-shutdown notifications to coordinate this process. This enhancement improves workload reliability during maintenance, restarts, or system updates.

These include support for decreasing memory usage and integration with Pod-level resources.</p>\n<p>This feature remains in beta in v1.34. For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the documentation: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/\">Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1287\">KEP #1287</a> led by SIG Node and SIG Autoscaling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"new-features-in-alpha\">New features in Alpha</h2>\n<p><em>This is a selection of some of the improvements that are now alpha following the v1.34 release.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-certificates-for-mtls-authentication\">Pod certificates for mTLS authentication</h3>\n<p>Authenticating workloads within a cluster, especially for communication with the API server, has primarily relied on ServiceAccount tokens. While effective, these tokens aren't always ideal for establishing a strong, verifiable identity for mutual TLS (mTLS) and can present challenges when integrating with external systems that expect certificate-based authentication.<br />\nKubernetes v1.34 introduces a built-in mechanism for Pods to obtain X.509 certificates via <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#pod-certificate-requests\">PodCertificateRequests</a>. The <code>kubelet</code> can request and manage certificates for Pods, which can then be used to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server and other services using mTLS.\nThe primary benefit is a more robust and flexible identity mechanism for Pods. It provides a native way to implement strong mTLS authentication without relying solely on bearer tokens, aligning Kubernetes with standard security practices and simplifying integrations with certificate-aware observability and security tooling.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4317\">KEP #4317</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"restricted-pod-security-standard-now-forbids-remote-probes\">&quot;Restricted&quot; Pod security standard now forbids remote probes</h3>\n<p>The <code>host</code> field within probes and lifecycle handlers allows users to specify an entity other than the <code>podIP</code> for the <code>kubelet</code> to probe.\nHowever, this opens up a route for misuse and for attacks that bypass security controls, since the <code>host</code> field could be set to <strong>any</strong> value, including security sensitive external hosts, or localhost on the node.\nIn Kubernetes v1.34, Pods only meet the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted\">Restricted</a>\nPod security standard if they either leave the <code>host</code> field unset, or if they don't even use this\nkind of probe.\nYou can use <em>Pod security admission</em>, or a third party solution, to enforce that Pods meet this standard. Because these are security controls, check\nthe documentation to understand the limitations and behavior of the enforcement mechanism you choose.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4940\">KEP #4940</a> led by SIG Auth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-status-nominatednodename-to-express-pod-placement\">Use <code>.status.nominatedNodeName</code> to express Pod placement</h3>\n<p>When the <code>kube-scheduler</code> takes time to bind Pods to Nodes, cluster autoscalers may not understand that a Pod will be bound to a specific Node. Consequently, they may mistakenly consider the Node as underutilized and delete it.<br />\nTo address this issue, the <code>kube-scheduler</code> can use <code>.status.nominatedNodeName</code> not only to indicate ongoing preemption but also to express Pod placement intentions. By enabling the <code>NominatedNodeNameForExpectation</code> feature gate, the scheduler uses this field to indicate where a Pod will be bound. This exposes internal reservations to help external components make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5278\">KEP #5278</a> led by SIG Scheduling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dra-features-in-alpha\">DRA features in alpha</h3>\n<h4 id=\"resource-health-status-for-dra\">Resource health status for DRA</h4>\n<p>It can be difficult to know when a Pod is using a device that has failed or is temporarily unhealthy, which makes troubleshooting Pod crashes challenging or impossible.<br />\nResource Health Status for DRA improves observability by exposing the health status of devices allocated to a Pod in the Pod’s status. This makes it easier to identify the cause of Pod issues related to unhealthy devices and respond appropriately.<br />\nTo enable this functionality, the <code>ResourceHealthStatus</code> feature gate must be enabled, and the DRA driver must implement the <code>DRAResourceHealth</code> gRPC service.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4680\">KEP #4680</a> led by WG Device Management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"extended-resource-mapping\">Extended resource mapping</h4>\n<p>Extended resource mapping provides a simpler alternative to DRA's expressive and flexible approach by offering a straightforward way to describe resource capacity and consumption. This feature enables cluster administrators to advertise DRA-managed resources as <em>extended resources</em>, allowing application developers and operators to continue using the familiar container’s <code>.spec.resources</code> syntax to consume them.<br />\nThis enables existing workloads to adopt DRA without modifications, simplifying the transition to DRA for both application developers and cluster administrators.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5004\">KEP #5004</a> led by WG Device Management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dra-consumable-capacity\">DRA consumable capacity</h4>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.33 added support for resource drivers to advertise slices of a device that are available, rather than exposing the entire device as an all-or-nothing resource. However, this approach couldn't handle scenarios where device drivers manage fine-grained, dynamic portions of a device resource based on user demand, or share those resources independently of ResourceClaims, which are restricted by their spec and namespace.<br />\nEnabling the <code>DRAConsumableCapacity</code> feature gate\n(introduced as alpha in v1.34)\nallows resource drivers to share the same device, or even a slice of a device, across multiple ResourceClaims or across multiple DeviceRequests.\nThe feature also extends the scheduler to support allocating portions of device resources,\nas defined in the <code>capacity</code> field.\nThis DRA feature improves device sharing across namespaces and claims, tailoring it to Pod needs. It enables drivers to enforce capacity limits, enhances scheduling, and supports new use cases like bandwidth-aware networking and multi-tenant sharing.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5075\">KEP #5075</a> led by WG Device Management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"device-binding-conditions\">Device binding conditions</h4>\n<p>The Kubernetes scheduler gets more reliable by delaying binding a Pod to a Node until its required external resources, such as attachable devices or FPGAs, are confirmed to be ready.<br />\nThis delay mechanism is implemented in the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#pre-bind\">PreBind phase</a> of the scheduling framework. During this phase, the scheduler checks whether all required device conditions are satisfied before proceeding with binding. This enables coordination with external device controllers, ensuring more robust, predictable scheduling.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5007\">KEP #5007</a> led by WG Device Management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"container-restart-rules\">Container restart rules</h3>\n<p>Currently, all containers within a Pod will follow the same <code>.spec.restartPolicy</code> when exited or crashed. However, Pods that run multiple containers might have different restart requirements for each container. For example, for init containers used to perform initialization, you may not want to retry initialization if they fail. Similarly, in ML research environments with long-running training workloads, containers that fail with retriable exit codes should restart quickly in place, rather than triggering Pod recreation and losing progress.<br />\nKubernetes v1.34 introduces the <code>ContainerRestartRules</code> feature gate. When enabled, a <code>restartPolicy</code> can be specified for each container within a Pod. A <code>restartPolicyRules</code> list can also be defined to override <code>restartPolicy</code> based on the last exit code. This provides the fine-grained control needed to handle complex scenarios and better utilization of compute resources.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5307\">KEP #5307</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h3 id=\"load-environment-variables-from-files-created-in-runtime\">Load environment variables from files created in runtime</h3>\n<p>Application developers have long requested greater flexibility in declaring environment variables.\nTraditionally, environment variables are declared on the API server side via static values, ConfigMaps, or Secrets.</p>\n<p>Behind the <code>EnvFiles</code> feature gate, Kubernetes v1.34 introduces the ability to declare environment variables at runtime.\nOne container (typically an init container) can generate the variable and store it in a file,\nand a subsequent container can start with the environment variable loaded from that file.\nThis approach eliminates the need to &quot;wrap&quot; the target container's entry point,\nenabling more flexible in-Pod container orchestration.</p>\n<p>This feature particularly benefits AI/ML training workloads,\nwhere each Pod in a training Job requires initialization with runtime-defined values.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3721\">KEP #5307</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graduations-deprecations-and-removals-in-v1-34\">Graduations, deprecations, and removals in v1.34</h2>\n<h3 id=\"graduations-to-stable\">Graduations to stable</h3>\n<p>This lists all the features that graduated to stable (also known as <em>general availability</em>).

See the Kubernetes\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">deprecation and removal policy</a> for more details on\nthis process. Kubernetes v1.34 includes a couple of deprecations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"manual-cgroup-driver-configuration-is-deprecated\">Manual cgroup driver configuration is deprecated</h4>\n<p>Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running Kubernetes clusters.\nKubernetes v1.28 added a way for the <code>kubelet</code>\nto query the CRI implementation and find which cgroup driver to use. That automated detection is now\n<strong>strongly recommended</strong> and support for it has graduated to stable in v1.34.\nIf your CRI container runtime does not support the\nability to report the croup driver it needs, you\nshould upgrade or change your container runtime.\nThe <code>cgroupDriver</code> configuration setting in the <code>kubelet</code> configuration file is now deprecated.\nThe corresponding command-line option <code>--cgroup-driver</code> was previously deprecated,\nas Kubernetes recommends using the configuration file instead.\nBoth the configuration setting and command-line option will be removed in a future release,\nthat removal will not happen before the v1.36 minor release.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4033\">KEP #4033</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h4 id=\"kubernetes-to-end-containerd-1-x-support-in-v1-36\">Kubernetes to end containerd 1.x support in v1.36</h4>\n<p>While Kubernetes v1.34 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases of containerd,\nas a consequence of automated cgroup driver detection, the Kubernetes SIG Node community\nhas formally agreed upon a final support timeline for containerd v1.X.\nThe last Kubernetes release to offer this support will be v1.35 (aligned with containerd 1.7 EOL).\nThis is an early warning that if you are using containerd 1.X, consider switching to 2.0+ soon.\nYou are able to monitor the <code>kubelet_cri_losing_support</code> metric to determine if any nodes in your\ncluster are using a containerd version that will soon be outdated.</p>\n<p>This work was done as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4033\">KEP #4033</a> led by SIG Node.</p>\n<h4 id=\"preferclose-traffic-distribution-is-deprecated\"><code>PreferClose</code> traffic distribution is deprecated</h4>\n<p>The <code>spec.trafficDistribution</code> field within a Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/\">Service</a> allows users to express preferences for how traffic should be routed to Service endpoints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3015\">KEP-3015</a> deprecates <code>PreferClose</code> and introduces two additional values: <code>PreferSameZone</code> and <code>PreferSameNode</code>. <code>PreferSameZone</code> is an alias for the existing <code>PreferClose</code> to clarify its semantics. <code>PreferSameNode</code> allows connections to be delivered to a local endpoint when possible, falling back to a remote endpoint when not possible.</p>\n<p>This feature was introduced in v1.33 behind the <code>PreferSameTrafficDistribution</code> feature gate.

By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills.</p>\n<p>However, enabling swap is not a &quot;turn-key&quot; solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet's eviction logic.</p>\n<p>In this blogpost, I'll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms.\nI will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction-to-linux-swap\">Introduction to Linux swap</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel's page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space. While the exact logic is a sophisticated optimization, this decision-making process is influenced by certain key factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Page access patterns (how recently pages are accessed)</li>\n<li>Page dirtyness (whether pages have been modified)</li>\n<li>Memory pressure (how urgently the system needs free memory)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"anonymous-vs-file-backed-memory\">Anonymous vs File-backed memory</h3>\n<p>It is important to understand that not all memory pages are the same. The kernel distinguishes between anonymous and file-backed memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Anonymous memory</strong>: This is memory that is not backed by a specific file on the disk, such as a program's heap and stack. From the application's perspective this is private memory, and when the kernel needs to reclaim these pages, it must write them to a dedicated swap device.</p>\n<p><strong>File-backed memory</strong>: This memory is backed by a file on a filesystem. This includes a program's executable code, shared libraries, and filesystem caches. When the kernel needs to reclaim these pages, it can simply discard them if they have not been modified (&quot;clean&quot;). If a page has been modified (&quot;dirty&quot;), the kernel must first write the changes back to the file before it can be discarded.</p>\n<p>While a system without swap can still reclaim clean file-backed pages memory under pressure by dropping them, it has no way to offload anonymous memory. Enabling swap provides this capability, allowing the kernel to move less-frequently accessed memory pages to disk to conserve memory to avoid system OOM kills.</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-kernel-parameters-for-swap-tuning\">Key kernel parameters for swap tuning</h3>\n<p>To effectively tune swap behavior, Linux provides several kernel parameters that can be managed via <code>sysctl</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>vm.swappiness</code>: This is the most well-known parameter. It is a value from 0 to 200 (100 in older kernels) that controls the kernel's preference for swapping anonymous memory pages versus reclaiming file-backed memory pages (page cache).\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High value (eg: 90+)</strong>: The kernel will be aggressive in swapping out less-used anonymous memory to make room for file-cache.</li>\n<li><strong>Low value (eg: &lt; 10)</strong>: The kernel will strongly prefer dropping file cache pages over swapping anonymous memory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>vm.min_free_kbytes</code>: This parameter tells the kernel to keep a minimum amount of memory free as a buffer. When the amount of free memory drops below the this safety buffer, the kernel starts more aggressively reclaiming pages (swapping, and eventually handling OOM kills).\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Function:</strong> It acts as a safety lever to ensure the kernel has enough memory for critical allocation requests that cannot be deferred.</li>\n<li><strong>Impact on swap</strong>: Setting a higher <code>min_free_kbytes</code> effectively raises the floor for for free memory, causing the kernel to initiate swap earlier under memory pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>vm.watermark_scale_factor</code>: This setting controls the gap between different watermarks: <code>min</code>, <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>, which are calculated based on <code>min_free_kbytes</code>.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Watermarks explained</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><code>low</code>: When free memory is below this mark, the <code>kswapd</code> kernel process wakes up to reclaim pages in the background. This is when a swapping cycle begins.</li>\n<li><code>min</code>: When free memory hits this minimum level, then aggressive page reclamation will block process allocation. Failing to reclaim pages will cause OOM kills.</li>\n<li><code>high</code>: Memory reclamation stops once the free memory reaches this level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Impact</strong>: A higher <code>watermark_scale_factor</code> careates a larger buffer between the <code>low</code> and <code>min</code> watermarks. This gives <code>kswapd</code> more time to reclaim memory gradually before the system hits a critical state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a typical server workload, you might have a long-running process with some memory that becomes 'cold'. A higher <code>swappiness</code> value can free up RAM by swapping out the cold memory, for other active processes that can benefit from keeping their file-cache.</p>\n<p>Tuning the <code>min_free_kbytes</code> and <code>watermark_scale_factor</code> parameters to move the swapping window early will give more room for <code>kswapd</code> to offload memory to disk and prevent OOM kills during sudden memory spikes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swap-tests-and-results\">Swap tests and results</h2>\n<p>To understand the real-impact of these parameters, I designed a series of stress tests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-setup\">Test setup</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Environment</strong>: GKE on Google Cloud</li>\n<li><strong>Kubernetes version</strong>: 1.33.2</li>\n<li><strong>Node configuration</strong>: <code>n2-standard-2</code> (8GiB RAM, 50GB swap on a <code>pd-balanced</code> disk, without encryption), Ubuntu 22.04</li>\n<li><strong>Workload</strong>: A custom Go application designed to allocate memory at a configurable rate, generate file-cache pressure, and simulate different memory access patterns (random vs sequential).</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: A sidecar container capturing system metrics every second.</li>\n<li><strong>Protection</strong>: Critical system components (kubelet, container runtime, sshd) were prevented from swapping by setting <code>memory.swap.max=0</code> in their respective cgroups.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"test-methodology\">Test methodology</h3>\n<p>I ran a stress-test pod on nodes with different swappiness settings (0, 60, and 90) and varied the <code>min_free_kbytes</code> and <code>watermark_scale_factor</code> parameters to observe the outcomes under heavy memory allocation and I/O pressure.</p>\n<h4 id=\"visualizing-swap-in-action\">Visualizing swap in action</h4>\n<p>The graph below, from a 100MBps stress test, shows swap in action. As free memory (in the &quot;Memory Usage&quot; plot) decreases, swap usage (<code>Swap Used (GiB)</code>) and swap-out activity (<code>Swap Out (MiB/s)</code>) increase. Critically, as the system relies more on swap, the I/O activity and corresponding wait time (<code>IO Wait %</code> in the &quot;CPU Usage&quot; plot) also rises, indicating CPU stress.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph showing CPU, Memory, Swap utilization and I/O activity on a Kubernetes node\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/19/tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/swap_visualization.png\" title=\"swap visualization\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"findings\">Findings</h3>\n<p>My initial tests with default kernel parameters (<code>swappiness=60</code>, <code>min_free_kbytes=68MB</code>, <code>watermark_scale_factor=10</code>) quickly led to OOM kills and even unexpected node restarts under high memory pressure. With selecting appropriate kernel parameters a good balance in node stability and performance can be achieved.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-impact-of-swappiness\">The impact of <code>swappiness</code></h4>\n<p>The swappiness parameter directly influences the kernel's choice between reclaiming anonymous memory (swapping) and dropping page cache. To observe this, I ran a test where one pod generated and held file-cache pressure, followed by a second pod allocating anonymous memory at 100MB/s, to observe the kernel preference on reclaim:</p>\n<p>My findings reveal a clear trade-off:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>swappiness=90</code>: The kernel proactively swapped out the inactive anonymous memory to keep the file cache. This resulted in high and sustained swap usage and significant I/O activity (&quot;Blocks Out&quot;), which in turn caused spikes in I/O wait on the CPU.</li>\n<li><code>swappiness=0</code>: The kernel favored dropping file-cache pages delaying swap consumption. However, it's critical to understand that this <strong>does not disable swapping</strong>. When memory pressure was high, the kernel still swapped anonymous memory to disk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The choice is workload-dependent. For workloads sensitive to I/O latency, a lower swappiness is preferable. For workloads that rely on a large and frequently accessed file cache, a higher swappiness may be beneficial, provided the underlying disk is fast enough to handle the load.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tuning-watermarks-to-prevent-eviction-and-oom-kills\">Tuning watermarks to prevent eviction and OOM kills</h4>\n<p>The most critical challenge I encountered was the interaction between rapid memory allocation and Kubelet's eviction mechanism. When my test pod, which was deliberately configured to overcommit memory, allocated it at a high rate (e.g., 300-500 MBps), the system quickly ran out of free memory.</p>\n<p>With default watermarks, the buffer for reclamation was too small. Before <code>kswapd</code> could free up enough memory by swapping, the node would hit a critical state, leading to two potential outcomes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Kubelet eviction</strong> If kubelet's eviction manager detected <code>memory.available</code> was below its threshold, it would evict the pod.</li>\n<li><strong>OOM killer</strong> In some high-rate scenarios, the OOM Killer would activate before eviction could complete, sometimes killing higher priority pods that were not the source of the pressure.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To mitigate this I tuned the watermarks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increased <code>min_free_kbytes</code> to 512MiB: This forces the kernel to start reclaiming memory much earlier, providing a larger safety buffer.</li>\n<li>Increased <code>watermark_scale_factor</code> to 2000: This widened the gap between the <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> watermarks (from ≈337MB to ≈591MB in my test node's <code>/proc/zoneinfo</code>), effectively increasing the swapping window.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This combination gave <code>kswapd</code> a larger operational zone and more time to swap pages to disk during memory spikes, successfully preventing both premature evictions and OOM kills in my test runs.</p>\n<p>Table compares watermark levels from <code>/proc/zoneinfo</code> (Non-NUMA node):</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><code>min_free_kbytes=67584KiB</code> and <code>watermark_scale_factor=10</code></th>\n<th><code>min_free_kbytes=524288KiB</code> and <code>watermark_scale_factor=2000</code></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Node 0, zone Normal <br />   pages free 583273 <br />   boost 0 <br />   min 10504 <br />   low 13130 <br />   high 15756 <br />   spanned 1310720 <br />   present 1310720 <br />   managed 1265603</td>\n<td>Node 0, zone Normal <br />   pages free 470539 <br />   min 82109 <br />   low 337017 <br />   high 591925<br />   spanned 1310720<br />   present 1310720 <br />   managed 1274542</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The graph below reveals that the kernel buffer size and scaling factor play a crucial role in determining how the system responds to memory load. With the right combination of these parameters, the system can effectively use swap space to avoid eviction and maintain stability.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A side-by-side comparison of different min_free_kbytes settings, showing differences in Swap, Memory Usage and Eviction impact\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/19/tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/memory-and-swap-growth.png\" title=\"Memory and Swap Utilization with min_free_kbytes\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"risks-and-recommendations\">Risks and recommendations</h3>\n<p>Enabling swap in Kubernetes is a powerful tool, but it comes with risks that must be managed through careful tuning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Risk of performance degradation</strong> Swapping is orders of magnitude slower than accessing RAM. If an application's active working set is swapped out, its performance will suffer dramatically due to high I/O wait times (thrashing). Swap could preferably be provisioned with a SSD backed storage to improve performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Risk of masking memory leaks</strong> Swap can hide memory leaks in applications, which might otherwise lead to a quick OOM kill. With swap, a leaky application might slowly degrade node performance over time, making the root cause harder to diagnose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Risk of disabling evictions</strong> Kubelet proactively monitors the node for memory-pressure and terminates pods to reclaim the resources. Improper tuning can lead to OOM kills before kubelet has a chance to evict pods gracefully. A properly configured <code>min_free_kbytes</code> is essential to ensure kubelet's eviction mechanism remains effective.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"kubernetes-context\">Kubernetes context</h3>\n<p>Together, the kernel watermarks and kubelet eviction threshold create a series of memory pressure zones on a node. The eviction-threshold parameters need to be adjusted to configure Kubernetes managed evictions occur before the OOM kills.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Preferred thresholds for effective swap utilization\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/19/tuning-linux-swap-for-kubernetes-a-deep-dive/swap-thresholds.png\" title=\"Recommended Thresholds\" /></p>\n<p>As the diagram shows, an ideal configuration will be to create a large enough 'swapping zone' (between <code>high</code> and <code>min</code> watermarks) so that the kernel can handle memory pressure by swapping before available memory drops into the Eviction/Direct Reclaim zone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-starting-point\">Recommended starting point</h3>\n<p>Based on these findings, I recommend the following as a starting point for Linux nodes with swap enabled. You should benchmark this with your own workloads.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>vm.swappiness=60</code>: Linux default is a good starting point for general-purpose workloads. However, the ideal value is workload-dependent, and swap-sensitive applications may need more careful tuning.</li>\n<li><code>vm.min_free_kbytes=500000</code> (500MB): Set this to a reasonably high value (e.g., 2-3% of total node memory) to give the node a reasonable safety buffer.</li>\n<li><code>vm.watermark_scale_factor=2000</code>: Create a larger window for <code>kswapd</code> to work with, preventing OOM kills during sudden memory allocation spikes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I encourage running benchmark tests with your own workloads in test-environments, when setting up swap for the first time in your Kubernetes cluster. Swap performance can be sensitive to different environment differences such as CPU load, disk type (SSD vs HDD) and I/O patterns.</p>",

The rise of tools like ChatGPT opened a world of\npossibilities, inspiring a wave of new applications. Asking questions or giving\ncommands in natural language is intuitive, especially for users who aren't deeply\ntechnical. Now everyone can quickly ask how to do X or Y, without feeling awkward\nor having to traverse pages and pages of documentation like before.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Headlamp AI Assistant brings a conversational UI to <a href=\"https://headlamp.dev\">Headlamp</a>,\npowered by LLMs that Headlamp users can configure with their own API keys.\nIt is available as a Headlamp plugin, making it easy to integrate into your\nexisting setup. Users can enable it by installing the plugin and configuring\nit with their own LLM API keys, giving them control over which model powers\nthe assistant. Once enabled, the assistant becomes part of the Headlamp UI,\nready to respond to contextual queries and perform actions directly from the\ninterface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"context-is-everything\">Context is everything</h2>\n<p>As expected, the AI Assistant is focused on helping users with Kubernetes\nconcepts. Yet, while there is a lot of value in responding to Kubernetes\nrelated questions from Headlamp's UI, we believe that the great benefit of such\nan integration is when it can use the context of what the user is experiencing\nin an application. So, the Headlamp AI Assistant knows what you're currently\nviewing in Headlamp, and this makes the interaction feel more like working\nwith a human assistant.</p>\n<p>For example, if a pod is failing, users can simply ask <em>&quot;What's wrong here?&quot;</em>\nand the AI Assistant will respond with the root cause, like a missing\nenvironment variable or a typo in the image name. Follow-up prompts like\n<em>&quot;How can I fix this?&quot;</em> allow the AI Assistant to suggest a fix, streamlining\nwhat used to take multiple steps into a quick, conversational flow.</p>\n<p>Sharing the context from Headlamp is not a trivial task though, so it's\nsomething we will keep working on perfecting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2>\n<p>Context from the UI is helpful, but sometimes additional capabilities are\nneeded. If the user is viewing the pod list and wants to identify problematic\ndeployments, switching views should not be necessary. To address this, the AI\nAssistant includes support for a Kubernetes tool. This allows asking questions\nlike &quot;Get me all deployments with problems&quot; prompting the assistant to fetch\nand display relevant data from the current cluster. Likewise, if the user\nrequests an action like &quot;Restart that deployment&quot; after the AI points out what\ndeployment needs restarting, it can also do that. In case of &quot;write&quot;\noperations, the AI Assistant does check with the user for permission to run them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ai-plugins\">AI Plugins</h2>\n<p>Although the initial version of the AI Assistant is already useful for\nKubernetes users, future iterations will expand its capabilities. Currently,\nthe assistant supports only the Kubernetes tool, but further integration with\nHeadlamp plugins is underway. Similarly, we could get richer insights for\nGitOps via the Flux plugin, monitoring through Prometheus, package management\nwith Helm, and more.</p>\n<p>And of course, as the popularity of MCP grows, we are looking into how to\nintegrate it as well, for a more plug-and-play fashion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out!</h2>\n<p>We hope this first version of the AI Assistant helps users manage Kubernetes\nclusters more effectively and assist newcomers in navigating the learning\ncurve. We invite you to try out this early version and give us your feedback.\nThe AI Assistant plugin can be installed from Headlamp's Plugin Catalog in the\ndesktop version, or by using the container image when deploying Headlamp.\nStay tuned for the future versions of the Headlamp AI Assistant!</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Kubernetes v1.34 is coming at the end of August 2025.\nThis release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements.\nHere are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle!</p>\n<p>Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1.34 development and may change before release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"featured-enhancements-of-kubernetes-v1-34\">Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.34</h2>\n<p>The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1.34 release,\nbut is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes.\nThis is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-core-of-dra-targets-stable\">The core of DRA targets stable</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/\">Dynamic Resource Allocation</a> (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize,\nrequest, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using <em>structured parameters</em> that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes.\nThe relevant enhancement proposal, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4381\">KEP-4381</a>, took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.\nDRA with structured parameters relies on a set of supporting API kinds: ResourceClaim, DeviceClass, ResourceClaimTemplate,\nand ResourceSlice API types under <code>resource.k8s.io</code>, while extending the <code>.spec</code> for Pods with a new <code>resourceClaims</code> field.\nThe core of DRA is targeting graduation to stable in Kubernetes v1.34.</p>\n<p>With DRA, device drivers and cluster admins define device classes that are available for use.\nWorkloads can claim devices from a device class within device requests.\nKubernetes allocates matching devices to specific claims and places the corresponding Pods on nodes that can access the allocated devices.\nThis framework provides flexible device filtering using CEL, centralized device categorization, and simplified Pod requests, among other benefits.</p>\n<p>Once this feature has graduated, the <code>resource.k8s.io/v1</code> APIs will be available by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"serviceaccount-tokens-for-image-pull-authentication\">ServiceAccount tokens for image pull authentication</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/\">ServiceAccount</a> token integration for <code>kubelet</code> credential providers is likely to reach beta and be enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.34.\nThis allows the <code>kubelet</code> to use these tokens when pulling container images from registries that require authentication.</p>\n<p>That support already exists as alpha, and is tracked as part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4412\">KEP-4412</a>.</p>\n<p>The existing alpha integration allows the <code>kubelet</code> to use short-lived, automatically rotated ServiceAccount tokens (that follow OIDC-compliant semantics) to authenticate to a container image registry.\nEach token is scoped to one associated Pod; the overall mechanism replaces the need for long-lived image pull Secrets.</p>\n<p>Adopting this new approach reduces security risks, supports workload-level identity, and helps cut operational overhead.\nIt brings image pull authentication closer to modern, identity-aware good practice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pod-replacement-policy-for-deployments\">Pod replacement policy for Deployments</h3>\n<p>After a change to a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/\">Deployment</a>, terminating pods may stay up for a considerable amount of time and may consume additional resources.\nAs part of <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3973\">KEP-3973</a>, the <code>.spec.podReplacementPolicy</code> field will be introduced (as alpha) for Deployments.</p>\n<p>If your cluster has the feature enabled, you'll be able to select one of two policies:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>TerminationStarted</code></dt>\n<dd>Creates new pods as soon as old ones start terminating, resulting in faster rollouts at the cost of potentially higher resource consumption.</dd>\n<dt><code>TerminationComplete</code></dt>\n<dd>Waits until old pods fully terminate before creating new ones, resulting in slower rollouts but ensuring controlled resource consumption.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>This feature makes Deployment behavior more predictable by letting you choose when new pods should be created during updates or scaling.\nIt's beneficial when working in clusters with tight resource constraints or with workloads with long termination periods.</p>\n<p>It's expected to be available as an alpha feature and can be enabled using the <code>DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy</code> and <code>DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas</code> feature gates in the API server and kube-controller-manager.</p>\n<h3 id=\"production-ready-tracing-for-kubelet-and-api-server\">Production-ready tracing for <code>kubelet</code> and API Server</h3>\n<p>To address the longstanding challenge of debugging node-level issues by correlating disconnected logs,\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a> provides deep, contextual insights into the <code>kubelet</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature instruments critical <code>kubelet</code> operations, particularly its gRPC calls to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), using the vendor-agnostic OpenTelemetry standard.\nIt allows operators to visualize the entire lifecycle of events (for example: a Pod startup) to pinpoint sources of latency and errors.\nIts most powerful aspect is the propagation of trace context; the <code>kubelet</code> passes a trace ID with its requests to the container runtime, enabling runtimes to link their own spans.</p>\n<p>This effort is complemented by a parallel enhancement, <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a>, which brings the same tracing capabilities to the Kubernetes API server.\nTogether, these enhancements provide a more unified, end-to-end view of events, simplifying the process of pinpointing latency and errors from the control plane down to the node.\nThese features have matured through the official Kubernetes release process.\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a> was introduced as an alpha feature in v1.25, while <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a> debuted as alpha in v1.22.\nBoth enhancements were promoted to beta together in the v1.27 release.\nLooking forward, Kubelet Tracing (<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2831\">KEP-2831</a>) and API Server Tracing (<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/647\">KEP-647</a>) are now targeting graduation to stable in the upcoming v1.34 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prefersamezone-and-prefersamenode-traffic-distribution-for-services\"><code>PreferSameZone</code> and <code>PreferSameNode</code> traffic distribution for Services</h3>\n<p>The <code>spec.trafficDistribution</code> field within a Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/\">Service</a> allows users to express preferences for how traffic should be routed to Service endpoints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3015\">KEP-3015</a> deprecates <code>PreferClose</code> and introduces two additional values: <code>PreferSameZone</code> and <code>PreferSameNode</code>.\n<code>PreferSameZone</code> is equivalent to the current <code>PreferClose</code>.\n<code>PreferSameNode</code> prioritizes sending traffic to endpoints on the same node as the client.</p>\n<p>This feature was introduced in v1.33 behind the <code>PreferSameTrafficDistribution</code> feature gate.\nIt is targeting graduation to beta in v1.34 with its feature gate enabled by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-kyaml-a-kubernetes-dialect-of-yaml\">Support for KYAML: a Kubernetes dialect of YAML</h3>\n<p>KYAML aims to be a safer and less ambiguous YAML subset, and was designed specifically\nfor Kubernetes. Whatever version of Kubernetes you use, you'll be able use KYAML for writing manifests\nand/or Helm charts.\nYou can write KYAML and pass it as an input to <strong>any</strong> version of <code>kubectl</code>,\nbecause all KYAML files are also valid as YAML.\nWith kubectl v1.34, we expect you'll also be able to request KYAML output from <code>kubectl</code> (as in <code>kubectl get -o kyaml …</code>).\nIf you prefer, you can still request the output in JSON or YAML format.</p>\n<p>KYAML addresses specific challenges with both YAML and JSON.\nYAML's significant whitespace requires careful attention to indentation and nesting,\nwhile its optional string-quoting can lead to unexpected type coercion (for example: <a href=\"https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/\">&quot;The Norway Bug&quot;</a>).\nMeanwhile, JSON lacks comment support and has strict requirements for trailing commas and quoted keys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/5295\">KEP-5295</a> introduces KYAML, which tries to address the most significant problems by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Always double-quoting value strings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leaving keys unquoted unless they are potentially ambiguous</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always using <code>{}</code> for mappings (associative arrays)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always using <code>[]</code> for lists</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This might sound a lot like JSON, because it is! But unlike JSON, KYAML supports comments, allows trailing commas, and doesn't require quoted keys.</p>\n<p>We're hoping to see KYAML introduced as a new output format for <code>kubectl</code> v1.34.\nAs with all these features, none of these changes are 100% confirmed; watch this space!</p>\n<p>As a format, KYAML is and will remain a <strong>strict subset of YAML</strong>, ensuring that any compliant YAML parser can parse KYAML documents.\nKubernetes does not require you to provide input specifically formatted as KYAML, and we have no plans to change that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fine-grained-autoscaling-control-with-hpa-configurable-tolerance\">Fine-grained autoscaling control with HPA configurable tolerance</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4951\">KEP-4951</a> introduces a new feature that allows users to configure autoscaling tolerance on a per-HPA basis,\noverriding the default cluster-wide 10% tolerance setting that often proves too coarse-grained for diverse workloads.\nThe enhancement adds an optional <code>tolerance</code> field to the HPA's <code>spec.behavior.scaleUp</code> and <code>spec.behavior.scaleDown</code> sections,\nenabling different tolerance values for scale-up and scale-down operations,\nwhich is particularly valuable since scale-up responsiveness is typically more critical than scale-down speed for handling traffic surges.</p>\n<p>Released as alpha in Kubernetes v1.33 behind the <code>HPAConfigurableTolerance</code> feature gate, this feature is expected to graduate to beta in v1.34.\nThis improvement helps to address scaling challenges with large deployments, where for scaling in,\na 10% tolerance might mean leaving hundreds of unnecessary Pods running.\nUsing the new, more flexible approach would enable workload-specific optimization for both\nresponsive and conservative scaling behaviors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"want-to-know-more\">Want to know more?</h2>\n<p>New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes.\nWe will formally announce what's new in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md\">Kubernetes v1.34</a> as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes v1.34 release is planned for <strong>Wednesday 27th August 2025</strong>.

      "summary": "<p>The world of cryptography is on the cusp of a major shift with the advent of\nquantum computing. While powerful quantum computers are still largely\ntheoretical for many applications, their potential to break current\ncryptographic standards is a serious concern, especially for long-lived\nsystems. This is where <em>Post-Quantum Cryptography</em> (PQC) comes in. In this\narticle, I'll dive into what PQC means for TLS and, more specifically, for the\nKubernetes ecosystem. I'll explain what the (suprising) state of PQC in\nKubernetes is and what the implications are for current and future clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-post-quantum-cryptography\">What is Post-Quantum Cryptography</h2>\n<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to\nbe secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The primary\nconcern is that quantum computers, using algorithms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm\">Shor's Algorithm</a>,\ncould efficiently break widely used public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and\nElliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which underpin much of today's secure\ncommunication, including TLS. The industry is actively working on standardizing\nand adopting PQC algorithms. One of the first to be standardized by <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\">NIST</a> is\nthe Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (<code>ML-KEM</code>), formerly known as\nKyber, and now standardized as <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.pdf\">FIPS-203</a> (PDF download).</p>\n<p>It is difficult to predict when quantum computers will be able to break\nclassical algorithms. However, it is clear that we need to start migrating to\nPQC algorithms now, as the next section shows. To get a feeling for the\npredicted timeline we can look at a <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf\">NIST report</a> covering the transition to\npost-quantum cryptography standards. It declares that system with classical\ncrypto should be deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timelines\">Key exchange vs. digital signatures: different needs, different timelines</h2>\n<p>In TLS, there are two main cryptographic operations we need to secure:</p>\n<p><strong>Key Exchange</strong>: This is how the client and server agree on a shared secret to\nencrypt their communication. If an attacker records encrypted traffic today,\nthey could decrypt it in the future, if they gain access to a quantum computer\ncapable of breaking the key exchange. This makes migrating KEMs to PQC an\nimmediate priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital Signatures</strong>: These are primarily used to authenticate the server (and\nsometimes the client) via certificates. The authenticity of a server is\nverified at the time of connection. While important, the risk of an attack\ntoday is much lower, because the decision of trusting a server cannot be abused\nafter the fact. Additionally, current PQC signature schemes often come with\nsignificant computational overhead and larger key/signature sizes compared to\ntheir classical counterparts.</p>\n<p>Another significant hurdle in the migration to PQ certificates is the upgrade\nof root certificates. These certificates have long validity periods and are\ninstalled in many devices and operating systems as trust anchors.</p>\n<p>Given these differences, the focus for immediate PQC adoption in TLS has been\non hybrid key exchange mechanisms. These combine a classical algorithm (such as\nElliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)) with a PQC algorithm (such as\n<code>ML-KEM</code>). The resulting shared secret is secure as long as at least one of the\ncomponent algorithms remains unbroken. The <code>X25519MLKEM768</code> hybrid scheme is the\nmost widely supported one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-kems\">State of PQC key exchange mechanisms (KEMs) today</h2>\n<p>Support for PQC KEMs is rapidly improving across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Go</strong>: The Go standard library's <code>crypto/tls</code> package introduced support for\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code> in version 1.24 (released February 2025). Crucially, it's\nenabled by default when there is no explicit configuration, i.e.,\n<code>Config.CurvePreferences</code> is <code>nil</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Browsers &amp; OpenSSL</strong>: Major browsers like Chrome (version 131, November 2024)\nand Firefox (version 135, February 2025), as well as OpenSSL (version 3.5.0,\nApril 2025), have also added support for the <code>ML-KEM</code> based hybrid scheme.</p>\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-lb/122756\">rolling out support</a> for <code>X25519MLKEM768</code> in version\n26 of their operating systems. Given the proliferation of Apple devices, this\nwill have a significant impact on the global PQC adoption.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed overview of the state of PQC in the wider industry,\nsee <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/pq-2024/\">this blog post by Cloudflare</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-quantum-kems-in-kubernetes-an-unexpected-arrival\">Post-quantum KEMs in Kubernetes: an unexpected arrival</h2>\n<p>So, what does this mean for Kubernetes? Kubernetes components, including the\nAPI server and kubelet, are built with Go.</p>\n<p>As of Kubernetes v1.33, released in April 2025, the project uses Go 1.24. A\nquick check of the Kubernetes codebase reveals that <code>Config.CurvePreferences</code>\nis not explicitly set. This leads to a fascinating conclusion: Kubernetes\nv1.33, by virtue of using Go 1.24, supports hybrid post-quantum\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code> for TLS connections by default!</p>\n<p>You can test this yourself. If you set up a Minikube cluster running Kubernetes\nv1.33.0, you can connect to the API server using a recent OpenSSL client:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-console\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> minikube start --kubernetes-version<span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span>v1.33.0\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl cluster-info\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt;\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> kubectl config view --minify --raw -o <span style=\"color: #b8860b;\">jsonpath</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">=</span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\'</span><span style=\"color: #666;\">{</span>.clusters<span style=\"color: #666;\">[</span>0<span style=\"color: #666;\">]</span>.cluster.certificate-authority-data<span style=\"color: #666;\">}</span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\">\\'</span> | base64 -d &gt; ca.crt\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> openssl version\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025 (Library: OpenSSL 3.5.0 8 Apr 2025)\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\"></span><span style=\"color: #000080; font-weight: bold;\">$</span> <span style=\"color: #a2f;\">echo</span> -n <span style=\"color: #b44;\">\"Q\"</span> | openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt; -CAfile ca.crt\n</span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">[...]\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">Negotiated TLS1.3 group: X25519MLKEM768\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">[...]\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #888;\">DONE\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lo and behold, the negotiated group is <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>! This is a significant\nstep towards making Kubernetes quantum-safe, seemingly without a major\nannouncement or dedicated KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal).</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-go-version-mismatch-pitfall\">The Go version mismatch pitfall</h2>\n<p>An interesting wrinkle emerged with Go versions 1.23 and 1.24. Go 1.23\nincluded experimental support for a draft version of <code>ML-KEM</code>, identified as\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>. This was also enabled by default if\n<code>Config.CurvePreferences</code> was <code>nil</code>. Kubernetes v1.32 used Go 1.23. However,\nGo 1.24 removed the draft support and replaced it with the standardized version\n<code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.</p>\n<p>What happens if a client and server are using mismatched Go versions (one on\n1.23, the other on 1.24)? They won't have a common PQC KEM to negotiate, and\nthe handshake will fall back to classical ECC curves (e.g., <code>X25519</code>). How\ncould this happen in practice?</p>\n<p>Consider a scenario:</p>\n<p>A Kubernetes cluster is running v1.32 (using Go 1.23 and thus\n<code>X25519Kyber768Draft00</code>). A developer upgrades their <code>kubectl</code> to v1.33,\ncompiled with Go 1.24, only supporting <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>. Now, when <code>kubectl</code>\ncommunicates with the v1.32 API server, they no longer share a common PQC\nalgorithm. The connection will downgrade to classical cryptography, silently\nlosing the PQC protection that has been in place. This highlights the\nimportance of understanding the implications of Go version upgrades, and the\ndetails of the TLS stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limitation-packet-size\">Limitations: packet size</h2>\n<p>One practical consideration with <code>ML-KEM</code> is the size of its public keys\nwith encoded key sizes of around 1.2 kilobytes for <code>ML-KEM-768</code>.\nThis can cause the initial TLS <code>ClientHello</code> message not to fit inside\na single TCP/IP packet, given the typical networking constraints\n(most commonly, the standard Ethernet frame size limit of 1500\nbytes). Some TLS libraries or network appliances might not handle this\ngracefully, assuming the Client Hello always fits in one packet. This issue\nhas been observed in some Kubernetes-related projects and networking\ncomponents, potentially leading to connection failures when PQC KEMs are used.\nMore details can be found at <a href=\"https://tldr.fail/\">tldr.fail</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-post-quantum-signatures\">State of Post-Quantum Signatures</h2>\n<p>While KEMs are seeing broader adoption, PQC digital signatures are further\nbehind in terms of widespread integration into standard toolchains. NIST has\npublished standards for PQC signatures, such as <code>ML-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-204</code>) and\n<code>SLH-DSA</code> (<code>FIPS-205</code>). However, implementing these in a way that's broadly\nusable (e.g., for PQC Certificate Authorities) <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#the-algorithms\">presents challenges</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Larger Keys and Signatures</strong>: PQC signature schemes often have significantly\nlarger public keys and signature sizes compared to classical algorithms like\nEd25519 or RSA. For instance, Dilithium2 keys can be 30 times larger than\nEd25519 keys, and certificates can be 12 times larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Signing and verification operations <a href=\"https://pqshield.github.io/nist-sigs-zoo/\">can be substantially slower</a>.\nWhile some algorithms are on par with classical algorithms, others may have a\nmuch higher overhead, sometimes on the order of 10x to 1000x worse performance.\nTo improve this situation, NIST is running a\n<a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2024/pqc-digital-signature-second-round-announcement\">second round of standardization</a> for PQC signatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Toolchain Support</strong>: Mainstream TLS libraries and CA software do not yet have\nmature, built-in support for these new signature algorithms. The Go team, for\nexample, has indicated that <code>ML-DSA</code> support is a high priority, but the\nsoonest it might appear in the standard library is Go 1.26 <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/64537#issuecomment-2877714729\">(as of May 2025)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/circl\">Cloudflare's CIRCL</a> (Cloudflare Interoperable Reusable Cryptographic Library)\nlibrary implements some PQC signature schemes like variants of Dilithium, and\nthey maintain a <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/go\">fork of Go (cfgo)</a> that integrates CIRCL. Using <code>cfgo</code>, it's\npossible to experiment with generating certificates signed with PQC algorithms\nlike Ed25519-Dilithium2. However, this requires using a custom Go toolchain and\nis not yet part of the mainstream Kubernetes or Go distributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The journey to a post-quantum secure Kubernetes is underway, and perhaps\nfurther along than many realize, thanks to the proactive adoption of <code>ML-KEM</code>\nin Go. With Kubernetes v1.33, users are already benefiting from hybrid post-quantum key\nexchange in many TLS connections by default.</p>\n<p>However, awareness of potential pitfalls, such as Go version mismatches leading\nto downgrades and issues with Client Hello packet sizes, is crucial. While PQC\nfor KEMs is becoming a reality, PQC for digital signatures and certificate\nhierarchies is still in earlier stages of development and adoption for\nmainstream use. As Kubernetes maintainers and contributors, staying informed\nabout these developments will be key to ensuring the long-term security of the\nplatform.</p>",

These\nworkloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can\nsignificantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As\nhighlighted in the 2024 <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/\">Llama\npaper</a>,\nhardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in\nAI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling\ndevices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by <a href=\"https://kccncna2024.sched.com/event/1i7kJ/all-your-gpus-are-belong-to-us-an-inside-look-at-nvidias-self-healing-geforce-now-infrastructure-ryan-hallisey-piotr-prokop-pl-nvidia\">Ryan Hallisey and Piotr\nProkop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA's Self-Healing\nGeForce NOW\nInfrastructure</a>\n(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLnHtKwmu2I\">recording</a>) as they see 19\nremediation requests per 1000 nodes a day!\nWe also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on\npower, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model.</p>\n<p>However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is\neither there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay\nthere fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial\nhardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead\nto a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-ai-ml-workloads\">Understanding AI/ML workloads</h3>\n<p>Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging\nscheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle. AI/ML workloads typically\nfall into two categories - training and inference. Here is an oversimplified\nview of those categories’ characteristics, which are different from traditional workloads\nlike web services:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Training</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are resource-intensive, often consuming entire\nmachines and running as gangs of pods. Training jobs are usually &quot;run to\ncompletion&quot; - but that could be days, weeks or even months. Any failure in a\nsingle pod can necessitate restarting the entire step across all the pods.</dd>\n<dt>Inference</dt>\n<dd>These workloads are usually long-running or run indefinitely,\nand can be small enough to consume a subset of a Node’s devices or large enough to span\nmultiple nodes. They often require downloading huge files with the model\nweights.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These workload types specifically break many past assumptions:</p>\n<table><caption style=\"display: none;\">Workload assumptions before and now</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Before</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Now</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Can get a better CPU and the app will work faster.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Require a <strong>specific</strong> device (or <strong>class of devices</strong>) to run.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">When something doesn’t work, just recreate it.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Allocation or reallocation is expensive.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Any node will work. No need to coordinate between Pods.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Scheduled in a special way - devices often connected in a cross-node topology.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Each Pod can be plug-and-play replaced if failed.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Pods are a part of a larger task. Lifecycle of an entire task depends on each Pod.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Container images are slim and easily available.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Container images may be so big that they require special handling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Long initialization can be offset by slow rollout.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Initialization may be long and should be optimized, sometimes across many Pods together.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Compute nodes are commoditized and relatively inexpensive, so some idle time is acceptable.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Nodes with specialized hardware can be an order of magnitude more expensive than those without, so idle time is very wasteful.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The existing failure model was relying on old assumptions. It may still work for\nthe new workload types, but it has limited knowledge about devices and is very\nexpensive for them. In some cases, even prohibitively expensive. You will see\nmore examples later in this article.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-kubernetes-still-reigns-supreme\">Why Kubernetes still reigns supreme</h3>\n<p>This article is not going deeper into the question: why not start fresh for<br />\nAI/ML workloads since they are so different from the traditional Kubernetes\nworkloads. Despite many challenges, Kubernetes remains the platform of choice\nfor AI/ML workloads. Its maturity, security, and rich ecosystem of tools make it\na compelling option. While alternatives exist, they often lack the years of\ndevelopment and refinement that Kubernetes offers. And the Kubernetes developers\nare actively addressing the gaps identified in this article and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-current-state-of-device-failure-handling\">The current state of device failure handling</h2>\n<p>This section outlines different failure modes and the best practices and DIY\n(Do-It-Yourself) solutions used today. The next session will describe a roadmap\nof improving things for those failure modes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>In order to understand the failures related to the Kubernetes infrastructure,\nyou need to understand how many moving parts are involved in scheduling a Pod on\nthe node. The sequence of events when the Pod is scheduled in the Node is as\nfollows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is scheduled on the Node</li>\n<li><em>Device plugin</em> is registered with the <em>kubelet</em> via local gRPC</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> uses <em>device plugin</em> to watch for devices and updates capacity of\nthe node</li>\n<li><em>Scheduler</em> places a <em>user Pod</em> on a Node based on the updated capacity</li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> asks <em>Device plugin</em> to <strong>Allocate</strong> devices for a <em>User Pod</em></li>\n<li><em>Kubelet</em> creates a <em>User Pod</em> with the allocated devices attached to it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This diagram shows some of those actors involved:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The diagram shows relationships between the kubelet, Device plugin, and a user Pod. It shows that kubelet connects to the Device plugin named my-device, kubelet reports the node status with the my-device availability, and the user Pod requesting the 2 of my-device.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-devices.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>As there are so many actors interconnected, every one of them and every\nconnection may experience interruptions. This leads to many exceptional\nsituations that are often considered failures, and may cause serious workload\ninterruptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pods failing admission at various stages of its lifecycle</li>\n<li>Pods unable to run on perfectly fine hardware</li>\n<li>Scheduling taking unexpectedly long time</li>\n</ul>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The same diagram as one above it, however it has an overlayed orange bang drawings over individual components with the text indicating what can break in that component. Over the kubelet text reads: 'kubelet restart: looses all devices info before re-Watch'. Over the Device plugin text reads: 'device plugin update, evictIon, restart: kubelet cannot Allocate devices or loses all devices state'. Over the user Pod text reads: 'slow pod termination: devices are unavailable'.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/k8s-infra-failures.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>The goal for Kubernetes is to make the interruption between these components as\nreliable as possible. Kubelet already implements retries, grace periods, and\nother techniques to improve it. The roadmap section goes into details on other\nedge cases that the Kubernetes project tracks. However, all these improvements\nonly work when these best practices are followed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure and restart kubelet and the container runtime (such as containerd or CRI-O)\nas early as possible to not interrupt the workload.</li>\n<li>Monitor device plugin health and carefully plan for upgrades.</li>\n<li>Do not overload the node with less-important workloads to prevent interruption\nof device plugin and other components.</li>\n<li>Configure user pods tolerations to handle node readiness flakes.</li>\n<li>Configure and code graceful termination logic carefully to not block devices\nfor too long.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another class of Kubernetes infra-related issues is driver-related. With\ntraditional resources like CPU and memory, no compatibility checks between the\napplication and hardware were needed. With special devices like hardware\naccelerators, there are new failure modes. Device drivers installed on the node:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must match the hardware</li>\n<li>Be compatible with an app</li>\n<li>Must work with other drivers (like <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl\">nccl</a>,\netc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best practices for handling driver versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor driver installer health</li>\n<li>Plan upgrades of infrastructure and Pods to match the version</li>\n<li>Have canary deployments whenever possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the best practices in this section and using device plugins and device\ndriver installers from trusted and reliable sources generally eliminate this\nclass of failures. Kubernetes is tracking work to make this space even better.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-failed\">Failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>There is very little handling of device failure in Kubernetes today. Device\nplugins report the device failure only by changing the count of allocatable\ndevices. And Kubernetes relies on standard mechanisms like liveness probes or\ncontainer failures to allow Pods to communicate the failure condition to the\nkubelet. However, Kubernetes does not correlate device failures with container\ncrashes and does not offer any mitigation beyond restarting the container while\nbeing attached to the same device.</p>\n<p>This is why many plugins and DIY solutions exist to handle device failures based\non various signals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-controller\">Health controller</h4>\n<p>In many cases a failed device will result in unrecoverable and very expensive\nnodes doing nothing. A simple DIY solution is a <em>node health controller</em>. The\ncontroller could compare the device allocatable count with the capacity and if\nthe capacity is greater, it starts a timer. Once the timer reaches a threshold,\nthe health controller kills and recreates a node.</p>\n<p>There are problems with the <em>health controller</em> approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root cause of the device failure is typically not known</li>\n<li>The controller is not workload aware</li>\n<li>Failed device might not be in use and you want to keep other devices running</li>\n<li>The detection may be too slow as it is very generic</li>\n<li>The node may be part of a bigger set of nodes and simply cannot be deleted in\nisolation without other nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are variations of the health controller solving some of the problems\nabove. The overall theme here though is that to best handle failed devices, you\nneed customized handling for the specific workload. Kubernetes doesn’t yet offer\nenough abstraction to express how critical the device is for a node, for the\ncluster, and for the Pod it is assigned to.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pod-failure-policy\">Pod failure policy</h4>\n<p>Another DIY approach for device failure handling is a per-pod reaction on a\nfailed device. This approach is applicable for <em>training</em> workloads that are\nimplemented as Jobs.</p>\n<p>Pod can define special error codes for device failures. For example, whenever\nunexpected device behavior is encountered, Pod exits with a special exit code.\nThen the Pod failure policy can handle the device failure in a special way. Read\nmore on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-failure-policy\">Handling retriable and non-retriable pod failures with Pod failure\npolicy</a></p>\n<p>There are some problems with the <em>Pod failure policy</em> approach for Jobs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no well-known <em>device failed</em> condition, so this approach does not work for the\ngeneric Pod case</li>\n<li>Error codes must be coded carefully and in some cases are hard to guarantee.</li>\n<li>Only works with Jobs with <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>, due to the limitation of a pod\nfailure policy feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, this solution has limited applicability.</p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-pod-watcher\">Custom pod watcher</h4>\n<p>A little more generic approach is to implement the Pod watcher as a DIY solution\nor use some third party tools offering this functionality. The pod watcher is\nmost often used to handle device failures for inference workloads.</p>\n<p>Since Kubernetes just keeps a pod assigned to a device, even if the device is\nreportedly unhealthy, the idea is to detect this situation with the pod watcher\nand apply some remediation. It often involves obtaining device health status and\nits mapping to the Pod using Pod Resources API on the node. If a device fails,\nit can then delete the attached Pod as a remediation. The replica set will\nhandle the Pod recreation on a healthy device.</p>\n<p>The other reasons to implement this watcher:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Without it, the Pod will keep being assigned to the failed device forever.</li>\n<li>There is no <em>descheduling</em> for a pod with <code>restartPolicy=Always</code>.</li>\n<li>There are no built-in controllers that delete Pods in CrashLoopBackoff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Problems with the <em>custom pod watcher</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The signal for the pod watcher is expensive to get, and involves some\nprivileged actions.</li>\n<li>It is a custom solution and it assumes the importance of a device for a Pod.</li>\n<li>The pod watcher relies on external controllers to reschedule a Pod.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are more variations of DIY solutions for handling device failures or\nupcoming maintenance. Overall, Kubernetes has enough extension points to\nimplement these solutions. However, some extension points require higher\nprivilege than users may be comfortable with or are too disruptive. The roadmap\nsection goes into more details on specific improvements in handling the device\nfailures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>When the container code fails or something bad happens with it, like out of\nmemory conditions, Kubernetes knows how to handle those cases. There is either\nthe restart of a container, or a crash of a Pod if it has <code>restartPolicy: Never</code>\nand scheduling it on another node. Kubernetes has limited expressiveness on what\nis a failure (for example, non-zero exit code or liveness probe failure) and how\nto react on such a failure (mostly either Always restart or immediately fail the\nPod).</p>\n<p>This level of expressiveness is often not enough for the complicated AI/ML\nworkloads. AI/ML pods are better rescheduled locally or even in-place as that\nwould save on image pulling time and device allocation. AI/ML pods are often\ninterconnected and need to be restarted together. This adds another level of\ncomplexity and optimizing it often brings major savings in running AI/ML\nworkloads.</p>\n<p>There are various DIY solutions to handle Pod failures orchestration. The most\ntypical one is to wrap a main executable in a container by some orchestrator.\nAnd this orchestrator will be able to restart the main executable whenever the\njob needs to be restarted because some other pod has failed.</p>\n<p>Solutions like this are very fragile and elaborate. They are often worth the\nmoney saved comparing to a regular JobSet delete/recreate cycle when used in\nlarge training jobs. Making these solutions less fragile and more streamlined\nby developing new hooks and extension points in Kubernetes will make it\neasy to apply to smaller jobs, benefiting everybody.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes-device-degradation\">Failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>Not all device failures are terminal for the overall workload or batch job.\nAs the hardware stack gets more and more\ncomplex, misconfiguration on one of the hardware stack layers, or driver\nfailures, may result in devices that are functional, but lagging on performance.\nOne device that is lagging behind can slow down the whole training job.</p>\n<p>We see reports of such cases more and more often. Kubernetes has no way to\nexpress this type of failures today and since it is the newest type of failure\nmode, there is not much of a best practice offered by hardware vendors for\ndetection and third party tooling for remediation of these situations.</p>\n<p>Typically, these failures are detected based on observed workload\ncharacteristics. For example, the expected speed of AI/ML training steps on\nparticular hardware. Remediation for those issues is highly depend on a workload needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roadmap\">Roadmap</h2>\n<p>As outlined in a section above, Kubernetes offers a lot of extension points\nwhich are used to implement various DIY solutions. The space of AI/ML is\ndeveloping very fast, with changing requirements and usage patterns. SIG Node is\ntaking a measured approach of enabling more extension points to implement the\nworkload-specific scenarios over introduction of new semantics to support\nspecific scenarios. This means prioritizing making information about failures\nreadily available over implementing automatic remediations for those failures\nthat might only be suitable for a subset of workloads.</p>\n<p>This approach ensures there are no drastic changes for workload handling which\nmay break existing, well-oiled DIY solutions or experiences with the existing\nmore traditional workloads.</p>\n<p>Many error handling techniques used today work for AI/ML, but are very\nexpensive. SIG Node will invest in extension points to make those cheaper, with\nthe understanding that the price cutting for AI/ML is critical.</p>\n<p>The following is the set of specific investments we envision for various failure\nmodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-k8s-infrastructure\">Roadmap for failure modes: K8s infrastructure</h3>\n<p>The area of Kubernetes infrastructure is the easiest to understand and very\nimportant to make right for the upcoming transition from Device Plugins to DRA.\nSIG Node is tracking many work items in this area, most notably the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127460\">integrate kubelet with the systemd watchdog · Issue\n#127460</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128696\">DRA: detect stale DRA plugin sockets · Issue\n#128696</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127803\">Support takeover for devicemanager/device-plugin · Issue\n#127803</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127457\">Kubelet plugin registration reliability · Issue\n#127457</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128167\">Recreate the Device Manager gRPC server if failed · Issue\n#128167</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/128043\">Retry pod admission on device plugin grpc failures · Issue\n#128043</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, every interaction of Kubernetes components must be reliable via\neither the kubelet improvements or the best practices in plugins development\nand deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: device failed</h3>\n<p>For the device failures some patterns are already emerging in common scenarios\nthat Kubernetes can support. However, the very first step is to make information\nabout failed devices available easier. The very first step here is the work in\n<a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/4680\">KEP 4680</a> (Add Resource Health Status to the Pod Status for\nDevice Plugin and DRA).</p>\n<p>Longer term ideas include to be tested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate device failures into Pod Failure Policy.</li>\n<li>Node-local retry policies, enabling pod failure policies for Pods with\nrestartPolicy=OnFailure and possibly beyond that.</li>\n<li>Ability to <em>deschedule</em> pod, including with the <code>restartPolicy: Always</code>, so it can\nget a new device allocated.</li>\n<li>Add device health to the ResourceSlice used to represent devices in DRA,\nrather than simply withdrawing an unhealthy device from the ResourceSlice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-container-code-failed\">Roadmap for failure modes: container code failed</h3>\n<p>The main improvements to handle container code failures for AI/ML workloads are\nall targeting cheaper error handling and recovery. The cheapness is mostly\ncoming from reuse of pre-allocated resources as much as possible. From reusing\nthe Pods by restarting containers in-place, to node local restart of containers\ninstead of rescheduling whenever possible, to snapshotting support, and\nre-scheduling prioritizing the same node to save on image pulls.</p>\n<p>Consider this scenario: A big training job needs 512 Pods to run. And one of the\npods failed. It means that all Pods need to be interrupted and synced up to\nrestart the failed step. The most efficient way to achieve this generally is to\nreuse as many Pods as possible by restarting them in-place, while replacing the\nfailed pod to clear up the error from it. Like demonstrated in this picture:</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"The picture shows 512 pod, most ot them are green and have a recycle sign next to them indicating that they can be reused, and one Pod drawn in red, and a new green replacement Pod next to it indicating that it needs to be replaced.\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/03/navigating-failures-in-pods-with-devices/inplace-pod-restarts.svg\" />\n</figure>\n<p>It is possible to implement this scenario, but all solutions implementing it are\nfragile due to lack of certain extension points in Kubernetes. Adding these\nextension points to implement this scenario is on the Kubernetes roadmap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"roadmap-for-failure-modes-device-degradation\">Roadmap for failure modes: device degradation</h3>\n<p>There is very little done in this area - there is no clear detection signal,\nvery limited troubleshooting tooling, and no built-in semantics to express the\n&quot;degraded&quot; device on Kubernetes. There has been discussion of adding data on\ndevice performance or degradation in the ResourceSlice used by DRA to represent\ndevices, but it is not yet clearly defined. There are also projects like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator\">node-healthcheck-operator</a>\nthat can be used for some scenarios.</p>\n<p>We expect developments in this area from hardware vendors and cloud providers, and we expect to see mostly DIY\nsolutions in the near future. As more users get exposed to AI/ML workloads, this\nis a space needing feedback on patterns used here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-the-conversation\">Join the conversation</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes community encourages feedback and participation in shaping the\nfuture of device failure handling.

      "summary": "<p>In industries where systems must run very reliably and meet strict performance criteria such as telecommunication, high-performance or AI computing, containerized applications often need specific operating system configuration or hardware presence.\nIt is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components.\nDespite the existence of the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a>, a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements.\nThe need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">Node Feature Discovery (NFD)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html\">NFD</a> is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">hardware and system features</a> of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-for-image-compatibility-specification\">The need for image compatibility specification</h2>\n<h3 id=\"dependencies-between-containers-and-host-os\">Dependencies between containers and host OS</h3>\n<p>A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drivers</strong>:\nHost driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers.</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries or Software</strong>:\nThe container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment. Examples from high performance computing are MPI, EFA, or Infiniband.</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel Modules or Features</strong>:\nSpecific kernel features or modules must be present. Examples include having support of write protected huge page faults, or the presence of VFIO</li>\n<li>And more…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While containers in Kubernetes are the most likely unit of abstraction for these needs, the definition of compatibility can extend further to include other container technologies such as Singularity and other OCI artifacts such as binaries from a spack binary cache.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-cloud-and-hybrid-cloud-challenges\">Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud challenges</h3>\n<p>Containerized applications are deployed across various Kubernetes distributions and cloud providers, where different host operating systems introduce compatibility challenges.\nOften those have to be pre-configured before workload deployment or are immutable.\nFor instance, different cloud providers will include different operating systems like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RHCOS/RHEL</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Photon OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Linux 2</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Container-Optimized OS</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Azure Linux OS</strong></li>\n<li>And more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each OS comes with unique kernel versions, configurations, and drivers, making compatibility a non-trivial issue for applications requiring specific features.\nIt must be possible to quickly assess a container for its suitability to run on any specific environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"image-compatibility-initiative\">Image compatibility initiative</h3>\n<p>An effort was made within the <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-image-compatibility\">Open Containers Initiative Image Compatibility</a> working group to introduce a standard for image compatibility metadata.\nA specification for compatibility would allow container authors to declare required host OS features, making compatibility requirements discoverable and programmable.\nThe specification implemented in Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery is one of the discussed proposals.\nIt aims to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define a structured way to express compatibility in OCI image manifests.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Support a compatibility specification alongside container images in image registries.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Allow automated validation of compatibility before scheduling containers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept has since been implemented in the Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-in-node-feature-discovery\">Implementation in Node Feature Discovery</h3>\n<p>The solution integrates compatibility metadata into Kubernetes via NFD features and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> API.\nThis interface enables the user to match containers to nodes based on exposing features of hardware and software, allowing for intelligent scheduling and workload optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibility-specification\">Compatibility specification</h3>\n<p>The compatibility specification is a structured list of compatibility objects containing <em><a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">Node Feature Groups</a></em>.\nThese objects define image requirements and facilitate validation against host nodes.\nThe feature requirements are described by using <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/customization-guide.html#available-features\">the list of available features</a> from the NFD project.\nThe schema has the following structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>version</strong> (string) - Specifies the API version.</li>\n<li><strong>compatibilities</strong> (array of objects) - List of compatibility sets.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rules</strong> (object) - Specifies <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/usage/custom-resources.html#nodefeaturegroup\">NodeFeatureGroup</a> to define image requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>weight</strong> (int, optional) - Node affinity weight.</li>\n<li><strong>tag</strong> (string, optional) - Categorization tag.</li>\n<li><strong>description</strong> (string, optional) - Short description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example might look like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #008000;

font-weight: bold;\">\\\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span><span style=\"color: #b62; font-weight: bold;\"></span>--artifact-type application/vnd.nfd.image-compatibility.v1alpha1 &lt;image-url&gt;

This validation can be done using the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/reference/node-feature-client-reference.html\">nfd client</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span style=\"display: flex;\"><span>nfd compat validate-node --image &lt;image-url&gt;\n</span></span></code></pre></div></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Read the output from the client</strong></p>\n<p>Finally you can read the report generated by the tool or use your own tools to act based on the generated JSON report.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"validate-node command output\" src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/25/image-compatibility-in-cloud-native-environments/validate-node-output.png\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The addition of image compatibility to Kubernetes through Node Feature Discovery underscores the growing importance of addressing compatibility in cloud native environments.\nIt is only a start, as further work is needed to integrate compatibility into scheduling of workloads within and outside of Kubernetes.\nHowever, by integrating this feature into Kubernetes, mission-critical workloads can now define and validate host OS requirements more efficiently.\nMoving forward, the adoption of compatibility metadata within Kubernetes ecosystems will significantly enhance the reliability and performance of specialized containerized applications, ensuring they meet the stringent requirements of industries like telecommunications, high-performance computing or any environment that requires special hardware or host OS configuration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved</h2>\n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.17/contributing/\">Kubernetes Node Feature Discovery</a> project if you're interested in getting involved with the design and development of Image Compatibility API and tools.\nWe always welcome new contributors.</p>",

Stand by for more details, but for now, there is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages.</p>\n<p><del>Kubernetes Slack will lose its special status and will be changing into a standard free Slack on June 20, 2025</del>. Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can.</p>\n<p>For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options.</p>\n<p>On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/27204752526611-Feature-limitations-on-the-free-version-of-Slack\">feature limitations of free Slack</a>. The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations.</p>\n<p>Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md#what-actions-do-channel-owners-and-user-group-members-need-to-take-soon\">take some actions</a> to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The CNCF Projects Staff have proposed that our community look at migrating to Discord. Because of existing issues where we have been pushing the limits of Slack, they have already explored what a Kubernetes Discord would look like. Discord would allow us to implement new tools and integrations which would help the community, such as GitHub group membership synchronization. The Steering Committee will discuss and decide on our future platform.</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md\">FAQ</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/\">kubernetes-dev mailing list</a> and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C9T0QMNG4\">#announcements channel</a> for further news.

      "summary": "<p>Ever find yourself switching between tabs in GitLab just to keep track of\nwhat’s happening in your project? Maybe you’re checking on an issue, then\njumping to a merge request, then over to an epic to see how everything\nconnects. Before you know it, you’ve got a browser full of tabs and you’ve\nlost your train of thought.</p>\n<p>If that sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone. So many teams waste time and energy flipping through various items in their project management software, just trying to get a handle on their work.</p>\n<p>That's why we created <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/#embedded-views\">embedded views</a>, powered by <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/\">GitLab Query Language (GLQL)</a>. With embedded views, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/08/21/gitlab-18-3-released/\">available in 18.3</a>, you get live, relevant information right where you’re already working in GitLab. No more endless context switching. No more outdated reports. Just the info you need, right when you need it.</p>\n<h2>Why embedded views matter</h2>\n<p>Embedded views are more than just a new feature, they're a fundamental shift in how teams understand and track their work within GitLab. With embedded views, teams can maintain context while accessing real-time information, creating shared understanding, and improving collaboration without ever leaving their current workflow. It’s about making work tracking feel natural and effortless, so you can focus on what matters.</p>\n<h2>How it works: Real-time data right where you need it the most</h2>\n<p>Embedded views let you insert live GLQL queries in Markdown code blocks throughout wiki pages, epics, issues, and merge requests. Here's what makes them so useful:</p>\n<h3>Always up to date</h3>\n<p>GLQL queries are dynamic, pulling fresh data each time the page loads, so your embedded views always reflect the current state of your work, not the state when you embedded the view. When changes happen to issues, merge requests, or milestones, a page refresh will show those updates in your embedded view.</p>\n<h3>Contextual awareness</h3>\n<p>Use functions like <code>currentUser()</code> and <code>today()</code> to make queries context-specific. Your embedded views automatically adapt to show relevant information for whoever is viewing them, creating personalized experiences without manual configuration.</p>\n<h3>Powerful filtering</h3>\n<p>Filter by fields like assignee, author, label, milestone, health status, creation date, and more. Use logical expressions to get exactly the data you want. We support more than 30 fields as of 18.3.</p>\n<h3>Customizable display</h3>\n<p>You can display your data as a table, a list, or a numbered list. Choose which fields to show, set a limit on the number of items, and specify the sort order to keep your view focused and actionable.</p>\n<h3>Availability</h3>\n<p>You can use embedded views in group and project wikis, epic and issue descriptions, merge requests, and comments. GLQL is available across all GitLab tiers: Free, Premium, and Ultimate, on GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated. Certain functionality, such as displaying epics, status, custom fields, iterations, and weights, is available in the Premium and Ultimate tiers. Displaying health status is available only in Ultimate.</p>\n<h2>See embedded views in action</h2>\n<p>The syntax of an embedded view's source is a superset of YAML that consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>query</code> parameter: Expressions joined together with a logical operator, such as <code>and</code>.</li>\n<li>Parameters related to the presentation layer, like <code>display</code>, <code>limit</code>, or <code>fields</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>description</code>\nrepresented as YAML.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A view is defined in Markdown as a code block, similar to other code blocks like Mermaid.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Display a table of first 5 open issues assigned to the authenticated user in <code>gitlab-org/gitlab</code>.\nDisplay columns <code>title</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>health</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>epic</code>, <code>milestone</code>, <code>weight</code>, and <code>updated</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">```glql\ndisplay: table\ntitle: GLQL table 🎉\ndescription: This view lists my open issues\nfields: title, state, health, epic, milestone, weight, updated\nlimit: 5\nquery: project = &quot;gitlab-org/gitlab&quot; AND assignee = currentUser() AND state = opened\n```\n</code></pre>\n<p>This source should render a table like the one below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755193172/ibzfopvpztpglnccwrjj.png\" /></p>\n<p>An easy way to create your first embedded view is to navigate to the <strong>More options</strong> dropdown in the rich text editor toolbar. Once in this toolbar, select <strong>Embedded view</strong>, which populates the following query in a Markdown code block:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">```glql\nquery: assignee = currentUser()\nfields: title, createdAt, milestone, assignee\ntitle: Issues assigned to current user\n```\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save your changes to the comment or description where the code block appears, and you're done! You've successfully created your first embedded view!</p>\n<h2>How GitLab uses embedded views</h2>\n<p>Whether tracking merge requests targeting security releases, triaging bugs to improve backlog hygiene, or managing team onboarding and milestone planning, we rely on embedded views for mission-critical processes every day. This isn't just a feature we built, it's a tool we depend on to run our business effectively. When you adopt embedded views, you're getting a tested solution that's already helping GitLab teams work more efficiently, make data-driven decisions, and maintain visibility across complex workflows. Simply stated, embedded views can transform how your team accesses and analyzes the work that matters most to your success.</p>\n<p>To learn and see more about how GitLab is using embedded views internally, check out <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/how-gitlab-measures-red-team-impact-the-adoption-rate-metric/\">How GitLab measures Red Team impact: The adoption rate metric</a>, and Global Search Release Planning issues for the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/search-team/team-tasks/-/issues/239\">18.1</a>, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/search-team/team-tasks/-/issues/241\">18.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/search-team/team-tasks/-/issues/245\">18.3</a> milestones.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>Embedded views are just the start of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/knowledge/\">Knowledge Group's</a> vision for work tracking. Learn more about what we're focusing on next in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15249\">embedded views post-GA epic</a>.

This creates a treasure trove of contextual data that remains securely within your GitLab environment, unavailable to generic agents or large language models.</p>\n<p><strong>Second, we act as your software control plane.</strong> We orchestrate your most critical business processes through Git repositories, REST APIs, and webhook-based interfaces that power your end-to-end software delivery. Many of our customers consider this a tier-0 dependency that their critical business processes rely on daily.</p>\n<p><strong>Third, we deliver a powerful user experience.</strong> We deliver an integrated interface that helps eliminate the costly context-switching that slows down most engineering teams. With complete lifecycle visibility and collaboration tools in one platform, over 50 million registered users and our vast community depend on GitLab to get their work done. This expertise positions GitLab uniquely to pioneer intuitive human-to-AI collaboration that amplifies team productivity while preserving the workflows that our users know and trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Extending our platform with AI natively integrated at every layer</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">GitLab Duo Agent Platform</a> integrates and extends all three of these layers. It is designed for extensibility and interoperability, enabling customers and partners to build solutions that create even more value. Our open platform approach emphasizes seamless connectivity with external AI tools and systems while being deeply integrated into our existing stack at all three layers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we're extending our unified data platform with a <strong>Knowledge Graph,</strong> which indexes and stitches together code with all of the rest of your unstructured data, specifically optimized for agentic access. AI thrives on context, and we believe this will not only accelerate reasoning and inference by agents but also deliver lower-cost and higher-quality agentic outcomes.</li>\n<li>Second, we're adding an important <strong>Orchestration Layer</strong> to our existing Control Plane in three distinct parts: enabling agents and flows to register as subscribers for GitLab SDLC events, building a new orchestration engine that allows for purpose-built, multi-agent flows, and exposing GitLab tools, agents, and flows via MCP and standard protocols for unparalleled interoperability.</li>\n<li>Finally, we're extending the <strong>GitLab experience</strong> to deliver first-class agents and agent flows across the entire software development lifecycle. You'll be able to assign async tasks to agents, @ mention them in comments, and create custom agents with context specific to your workflows — but more importantly, GitLab is shipping native agents for every stage of development while unlocking a rich ecosystem of third-party agents. This creates true human-to-AI collaboration where agents become as natural to work with as your human teammates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch this video to see what's coming in 18.3 and beyond, or read on.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111796316?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;GitLab_18.3 Release_081925_MP_v1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>What's new in GitLab 18.3</h2>\n<p>With 18.2, we introduced specialized <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-public-beta/#agents-that-work-out-of-the-box:~:text=Agents%20that%20work%20out%20of%20the%20box\">AI agents</a> that work alongside developers across the software development lifecycle, plus our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-agent-platform-public-beta/#agents-that-work-out-of-the-box:~:text=we%20are%20building%3A-,Software%20Development%20Flow,-(now%20in%20beta\">Software Development Flow</a> — a powerful feature that gives users the ability to orchestrate multiple agents to plan, implement, and test code changes end-to-end.</p>\n<p>GitLab 18.3 introduces expanded integrations and interoperability, more Flows, and enhanced context awareness across the entire software development lifecycle.</p>\n<h3>Expanded integrations and interoperability</h3>\n<p>We're delivering comprehensive AI extensibility through both first-party GitLab agents and a rich ecosystem of third-party agents, all with full access to project context and data. This approach maintains native GitLab workflows and governance while providing the flexibility to choose preferred tools through highly integrated orchestration between these agents and GitLab's core platform. Teams gain enhanced AI functionality while preserving key integration, oversight, and user experience benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MCP server - Universal AI integration:</strong> GitLab's MCP (<a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ai/model-context-protocol/\">Model Context Protocol</a>) server enables AI systems to securely integrate directly with your GitLab projects and development processes. This standardized interface eliminates custom integration overhead and allows your AI tools — including <a href=\"https://docs.cursor.com/en/tools/mcp\">Cursor</a> — to work intelligently within your existing GitLab environment. See our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_server/\">docs</a> for a full list of tools included with 18.3. <strong>This is only the start; additional tools are planned for 18.4.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Bringing GitLab workflows directly into Cursor is a critical step in reducing friction for developers. By minimizing the need for context switching, teams can check issue status, review merge requests, and monitor pipeline results without ever leaving their coding environment. This integration is a natural fit for our shared customers, and we look forward to a long-term partnership with GitLab to continue enhancing developer productivity.”</em></p>\n<p>- <strong>Ricky Doar, VP of Field Engineering at Cursor</strong></p>\n<p><em>“GitLab's MCP server and CLI agent support create powerful new ways for Amazon Q to integrate with development workflows. Amazon Q Developer can now connect directly through GitLab's remote MCP interface, while teams can delegate development tasks by simply @ mentioning Amazon Q CLI in issues and merge requests. The robust security and governance capabilities built into these integrations give enterprises the confidence to leverage AI coding tools while preserving their development standards. Our partnership with GitLab demonstrates AWS' ongoing commitment to expanding our AI ecosystem and making intelligent development tools accessible wherever developers work.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>- <strong>Deepak Singh, Vice President of Developer Agents and Experiences at AWS</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CLI agent support for Claude Code, Codex, Amazon Q, Google Gemini, and opencode (Bring Your Own Key):</strong> 18.3 introduces integrations that enable teams to delegate routine development work by @ mentioning their agents directly in issues or merge requests. When developers mention these AI assistants, they automatically read the surrounding context and repository code, then respond to the user's comment with either ready-to-review code changes or inline comments. These integrations require you to bring your own API key for the respective AI providers and keep all interactions natively within GitLab's interface while maintaining proper permissions and audit trails.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Third-party agents is a GitLab Premium Beta feature and only available to GitLab Duo Enterprise customers for evaluation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111784124?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Third Party Agents Flows Claude Code&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Bringing Claude Code directly into GitLab puts AI assistance where millions of developers already collaborate and ship code daily. The ability to mention Claude directly in issues and merge requests removes friction while maintaining quality with human oversight and review processes. This update brings Claude Code's capabilities to more places where teams work, making AI a natural part of their developer workflow.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>- Cat Wu, Claude Code Product Lead, Anthropic</strong></p>\n<p><em>“With GitLab's new agent integration in 18.3 you can use opencode within your existing workflows. You can @mention opencode in an issue or merge request and it'll run your agent right in your CI pipeline. This ability to configure and run opencode the way you want is the type of integration we know the open source community really values.”</em></p>\n<p><strong>- Jay V., CEO, opencode</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agentic Chat support for Visual Studio IDE and GitLab UI available to all Premium and Ultimate customers:</strong> With 18.3, you no longer need to context-switch between tools to access GitLab's full development lifecycle data. Our enhanced integrations bring the complete power of GitLab Duo into the GitLab UI as well as IDEs — expanding support from JetBrains and VS Code to now include Visual Studio. This helps developers stay in flow while accessing rich project context, deployment history, and team collaboration data directly within their preferred environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Expanded AI model support:</strong> GitLab Duo Self-Hosted now supports additional AI models, giving teams more flexibility in their AI-supported development workflows. You can now deploy open source OpenAI GPT models (20B and 120B parameters) through vLLM on your datacenter hardware, or through cloud services like Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock in your private cloud. Additionally, Anthropic's Claude 4 is available on AWS Bedrock</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New automated development flows</h3>\n<p>GitLab Flows coordinate multiple AI agents with pre-built instructions to autonomously handle those time-consuming, mundane tasks so developers can focus on the work that matters most.</p>\n<p>GitLab 18.3 comes with two new Flows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Issue to MR Flow enabling automated code generation from concept to completion in minutes:</strong> This Flow automatically converts issues into actionable merge requests (MRs) by coordinating agents to analyze requirements, prepare comprehensive implementation plans, and generate production-grade code that's ready for review — helping you turn ideas into reviewable implementations in minutes, not hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111782058?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Issue to MR&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Convert CI File Flow built for seamless migration intelligence:</strong> Our Convert CI File Flow streamlines migration workflows by having agents analyze existing CI/CD configurations and intelligently convert them to GitLab CI format with full pipeline compatibility. This helps eliminate the manual effort and potential errors of rewriting CI configurations from scratch, enabling teams to migrate entire deployment pipelines with confidence. 18.3 includes support for Jenkins migrations. Additional support is planned for future releases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111783724?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Convert to CI Flow&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h3>Intelligent code and search</h3>\n<p>AI point solutions typically operate with limited visibility into isolated code snippets, but GitLab's Knowledge Graph provides agents with environment context to help inform faster and more intelligent responses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge Graph for real-time code intelligence:</strong> With 18.3, GitLab's Knowledge Graph now delivers real-time code indexing to enable faster code searches, delivering more accurate and contextual results. By understanding the relationships between files, dependencies, and development patterns across your entire codebase, our agents are designed to provide insights that would take human developers hours to uncover — <strong>and this is just the first step in unlocking the powerful capabilities that are planned for Knowledge Graph.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Enterprise governance</h3>\n<p>AI transparency and organizational control are critical challenges that can hold teams back from fully adopting AI-powered development tools, with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/software-innovation-report/\">85% of executives agreeing that agentic AI will create unprecedented security challenges</a>.</p>\n<p>These new features in 18.3 help address concerns around data governance, compliance requirements, and the need for visibility into AI decision-making processes so organizations can integrate AI within their existing security and policy frameworks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agent Insights for transparency through intelligence:</strong> Our built-in agent tracking provides visibility into agent decision-making processes. Users can optimize workflows and follow best practices through transparent activity tracking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111783244?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Agent Insights&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GitLab Duo Code Review for Self-Hosted:</strong> This brings the intelligence of GitLab Duo to organizations with strict data governance requirements by allowing teams to keep sensitive code in controlled environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid model configurations for flexible AI deployment:</strong> GitLab Duo Self-Hosted customers can now use hybrid model configurations, combining self-hosted AI models via their local AI gateway with GitLab's cloud models through GitLab's AI gateway, enabling access to various features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1111783569?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Self Hosted Models Code Review&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced security with OAuth support:</strong> Our MCP server now includes full OAuth 2.0 authentication support, enabling secure connections to protected resources and sensitive development environments. This implementation follows the draft OAuth specification for MCP, handling authorization flows, token management, and dynamic client registration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Secure by Design platform: Governance that scales</h3>\n<p>True platform security requires consistent application of governance principles across every layer of the development lifecycle. The same security fundamentals that make AI adoption safe — least-privilege access, centralized policy management, proactive monitoring, and granular permissions — must be embedded throughout the entire SDLC to create a cohesive, defense-in-depth approach.</p>\n<p>GitLab 18.3 strengthens the foundational controls that help protect your entire software supply chain with these new updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Custom admin role:</strong> Provides granular, purpose-built administrative permissions, replacing blanket admin access with precise, least-privilege controls. Instead of granting blanket administrative privileges that create security risks, organizations can now create specialized roles tailored to specific functions — platform teams managing runners and monitoring, support teams handling user management, and leadership accessing dashboards and usage statistics. With complete role lifecycle management through UI and API, audit logging, and auto-generated documentation, this feature enables true least-privilege administration while helping maintain operational efficiency and improve overall instance security.</li>\n<li><strong>Instance-level compliance framework and security policy management</strong>: Organizations can now designate a dedicated compliance group that has the authority to apply standardized frameworks and security policies directly to top-level groups, automatically cascading enforcement to all their subgroups and projects. This centralized approach eliminates the compliance adoption blocker of fragmented policy management while maintaining group autonomy for additional local policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced violations reporting:</strong> Teams now receive immediate notifications when unauthorized changes are made to MR approval rules, framework policies lack proper approvals, or time-based compliance controls are violated. By directly linking violations to specific compliance framework controls, teams get actionable insights that tell them exactly which requirement was breached, turning compliance from a reactive checkbox exercise into a proactive, integrated part of the development and security workflow.</li>\n<li><strong>Fine-grained permissions for CI/CD job tokens:</strong> Replaces broad token access with granular, explicit permissions that grant CI/CD jobs access only to specific API endpoints they actually need. Instead of allowing jobs blanket access to project resources, teams can now define precise permissions for deployments, packages, releases, environments, and other critical resources, reducing the attack surface and potential for privilege escalation.</li>\n<li><strong>AWS Secrets Manager integration:</strong> Teams using AWS Secrets Manager can now retrieve secrets directly in GitLab CI/CD jobs, simplifying the build and deploy processes. Secrets are accessed by a GitLab Runner using OpenID Connect protocol-based authentication, masked to prevent exposure in job logs, and destroyed after use. This approach eliminates the need to store secrets in variables and integrates cleanly into existing GitLab and AWS-based workflows. Developed in close collaboration with Deutsche Bahn and the AWS Secrets Manager team, this integration reflects our commitment to building solutions alongside customers to solve real-world challenges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Artifact management: Securing your software supply chain</h3>\n<p>When artifacts aren't properly governed, small changes can have big consequences. Mutable packages, overwritten container images, and inconsistent rules across tools can trigger production outages, introduce vulnerabilities, and create compliance gaps. For enterprise DevSecOps, secure, centralized artifact management is essential for keeping the software supply chain intact.</p>\n<h4>Enterprise-grade artifact protection in 18.3</h4>\n<p>Building on our comprehensive package protection capabilities, GitLab 18.3 adds important new features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Conan revisions support:</strong> New in 18.3, <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/conan_2_repository/#conan-revisions\">Conan revisions</a> provide package immutability for C++ developers. When changes are made to a package without changing its version, Conan calculates unique identifiers to track these changes, enabling teams to maintain immutable packages while preserving version clarity.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Container Registry security:</strong> Following the successful launch of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/container_registry/immutable_container_tags/\">immutable container tags</a> in 18.2, we're seeing strong enterprise adoption. Once a tag is created that matches an immutable rule, no one — regardless of permission level — can modify that container image, preventing unintended changes to production dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These enhancements complement our existing protection capabilities for npm, PyPI, Maven, NuGet, Helm charts, and generic packages, enabling platform teams to implement consistent governance across their entire software supply chain — a requirement for organizations building secure internal developer platforms.</p>\n<p>Unlike standalone artifact solutions, GitLab's integrated approach eliminates context switching between tools while providing end-to-end traceability from code to deployment, enabling platform teams to implement consistent governance across their entire software delivery pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Embedded views: Real-time visibility and reports</h3>\n<p>As GitLab projects grow in complexity, teams find themselves navigating between issues, merge requests, epics, and milestones to maintain visibility into work status. The challenge lies in consolidating this information efficiently while ensuring teams have real-time access to project progress without context switching or breaking their flow.\n<strong>Launching real-time work status visibility in 18.3</strong>\nGitLab 18.3's <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/glql/#embedded-views\">embedded views, powered by our powerful GitLab Query Language</a> (GLQL), eliminate context switching by bringing live project data directly into your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dynamic views:</strong> Insert live GLQL queries in Markdown code blocks throughout wiki pages, epics, issues, and merge requests that automatically refresh with current project states each time you load the page.</li>\n<li><strong>Contextual personalization:</strong> Views automatically adapt using functions like <code>currentUser()</code> and <code>today()</code> to show relevant information for whoever is viewing, without manual configuration.</li>\n<li><strong>Powerful filtering:</strong> Filter by 25+ fields, including assignee, author, label, milestone, health status, and creation date.</li>\n<li><strong>Display flexibility:</strong> Present data as tables, lists, or numbered lists with customizable field selection, item limits, and sort orders to keep your views focused and actionable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike fragmented project management approaches, we've designed embedded views to maintain your workflow continuity while providing real-time visibility, enabling teams to make informed decisions without losing focus or switching between multiple tools and interfaces.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn about the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/08/21/gitlab-18-3-released/\">newest features in GitLab 18.3</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Get started today</h2>\n<p>GitLab 18.3 is available now for GitLab Premium and Ultimate users on GitLab.com and self-managed environments.</p>\n<p>GitLab Dedicated customers are now upgraded to 18.2 and will be able to use the features released with GitLab 18.3 next month.</p>\n<p>Ready to experience the future of software engineering?<a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/turn_on_off/#turn-on-beta-and-experimental-features\"> Enable beta and experimental features for GitLab Duo</a> and start collaborating with AI agents that understand your complete development context.</p>\n<p>New to GitLab? <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/-/trials/new\">Start your free trial</a> today and discover why the future of software engineering is human and AI collaboration, orchestrated through the world's most comprehensive DevSecOps platform.</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

      "summary": "<p>The GitLab documentation site now has a completely updated look-and-feel.\nWhat started as a request for targeted design fixes grew into a comprehensive redesign that delivers five major improvements:</p>\n<h2>Top five new features</h2>\n<p><strong>Dark mode</strong>: The most requested feature is finally here. Toggle between light and dark themes in the upper-right corner\nfor improved readability and reduced eye strain.</p>\n<p><strong>Brand alignment</strong>: Our docs now reflect the modern colors and design language of both the GitLab marketing site and product UI,\ncreating a cohesive experience across all GitLab properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplified feedback</strong>: Users can now give thumbs up/down feedback and add comments directly on any documentation page.</p>\n<p><strong>Redesigned navigation</strong>: We've moved primary navigation to the top and restructured our left sidebar to make our 2,300+ pages\nfeel less overwhelming and more discoverable.</p>\n<p><strong>Addressed technical debt</strong>: Dozens of small but impactful fixes to typography, spacing, code blocks, and visual inconsistencies\nthat had accumulated over the years.</p>\n<h2>Why now? The foundation for change</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, led by Sarah German, our documentation engineering team completed a critical replatforming project,\nmigrating from Nanoc to Hugo. While largely invisible to users, this change delivered dramatic performance improvements — 130x faster local builds\nand 30x faster full builds — and provided the solid technical foundation needed for these improvements.</p>\n<p>This replatforming was essential groundwork that enabled us to focus on user experience enhancements rather than wrestling with outdated infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Let's look more closely at the changes.</p>\n<h3>Dark mode</h3>\n<p>Possibly the biggest news for this release: dark mode is now available across the entire documentation site.\nChange the setting in the upper-right corner, and the site will remember your preference.\nFor many users, dark mode makes content easier to read and reduces eye strain.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image of dark mode\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755617168/gz45eaygeb0nizf1kwyu.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Brand alignment with marketing site</h3>\n<p>The new design creates visual harmony between our documentation and the broader GitLab experience.\nWe've incorporated GitLab's modern color palette and design elements while maintaining the clean, functional feel users expect from technical documentation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image of new homepage\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755617230/ialfadj3i3theizk08p5.png\" /></p>\n<p>The updated homepage focuses on our primary documentation areas, including tutorials and getting started guides that help new users learn GitLab.</p>\n<h3>Simplified feedback mechanism</h3>\n<p>We've eliminated friction in the feedback process. Instead of requiring users to leave the docs site and create GitLab issues,\nthey can now provide immediate feedback with thumbs up/down ratings and comments directly on any page.\nScroll down on any documentation page to see this new functionality in action.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image of feedback area\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755617289/rjocpkmqumacaw7thjqi.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Navigation redesign</h3>\n<p>One of our biggest challenges was organizing over 2,300 pages in a way that doesn't overwhelm users.\nOur previous single left navigation, while comprehensive, created a daunting experience:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image of former navigation\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755617332/k75fwr3rhjxfjyxmc49d.png\" /></p>\n<p>The new approach moves primary navigation to the top, creating shorter, more manageable table of contents sections that feel less overwhelming to traverse:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image of new navigation\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755617366/wziabrijury9jl5j7ica.png\" /></p>\n<p>This structure better reflects the relationships between features while making individual sections more digestible.</p>\n<h3>Style updates and technical debt</h3>\n<p>Over the years, small style inconsistencies had accumulated — inconsistent padding in lists, extra spacing around alerts, and various typography issues.\nWhile these might seem minor, they created a subtly jarring experience for daily users.</p>\n<p>Our tabs and code blocks received particular attention, becoming better-defined in the process.</p>\n<p>Before, tabs with code looked like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image of old tabs with code block\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755617460/jsa2gz3b2slqu0udrg28.png\" /></p>\n<p>And now, with a few small tweaks, they look like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image of new tabs with code block\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1755617493/jpxiybvnadsex39lyawu.png\" /></p>\n<p>These &quot;papercut&quot; fixes may be small individually, but collectively they create a much more polished, professional experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>This redesign represents how we iterate at GitLab — shipping meaningful improvements while building toward an even better future.\nWe expect to continue refining the structure and adding features that help users find what they need more easily.</p>\n<p>User feedback will drive our next iterations, and with our new simplified feedback mechanism, we're better positioned than ever\nto hear directly from our documentation users.</p>\n<h2>The team</h2>\n<p>This transformation was a true team effort. Kudos to UX Papercuts and Julia Miocene for taking what started as a simple request and turning\nit into a comprehensive design vision. Thanks to the engineers in Technical Writing: Sarah German, Pearl Latteier,\nand Hiru Fernando, who brought these designs to life.</p>\n<p>The new design balances information density with visual clarity, modernizes our site while maintaining usability and accessibility standards,\nand represents a significant step forward in both user experience and visual design.</p>",

      "published": "2025-08-18T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>The Git project recently released <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqikikk1hr.fsf@gitster.g/T/#u\">Git 2.51</a>.\nDue to summer in the Northern Hemisphere and slower progress, this\nrelease cycle was on the shorter side of 8 weeks (typically a release cycle\nlasts about 12 weeks). Let’s look at some notable changes in this release,\nincluding contributions from the Git team at GitLab and also the wider Git\ncommunity.</p>\n<h2>Performance optimizations for <code>git-push(1)</code> and <code>git-fetch(1)</code></h2>\n<p>The <code>git-push(1)</code> and <code>git-fetch(1)</code> commands allow users to synchronize local and remote repositories. Part of the operation involves updating references in the repository. In repositories with many references, this can take significant time, especially for users who work with large development environments, monorepos, or repositories with extensive CI/CD pipelines.</p>\n<p>Git reference transactions can include multiple reference updates, but they follow an all-or-nothing approach. If any single update within the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails and none of the reference updates are applied. But reference updates as part of <code>git-push(1)</code> and <code>git-fetch(1)</code> are allowed to fail, which allows repositories to synchronize a subset of references even in the case where a different subset has diverged. To facilitate this behavior, Git creates a separate transaction for each reference update, allowing some transactions to fail while the rest succeed.</p>\n<p>Creating a separate transaction per update incurs significant overhead, as each transaction includes an initiation and teardown phase and also checks for whether there are conflicting reference names. The “reftable” backend also performs auto-compaction at the end of a transaction, so multiple transactions would trigger multiple auto-compactions, which would drastically increase the latency of the command.</p>\n<p>In Git 2.51.0, these commands now use batched updates instead of separate transactions. Batched updates allow updating multiple references under a single transaction, while still allowing some updates to fail. This removes the overhead and scales better with the number of references to be updated, since only a single transaction is used. This significantly improves the performance of the “reftable” backend, which now outperforms the “files” backend. Users can reap these performance improvements without needing to make any changes.</p>\n<p>For <code>git-fetch(1)</code> we see a <em>22x performance improvement for the “reftable” backend</em> and <em>1.25x improvement for the “files” backend</em> when used in a repository with 10,000 references.</p>\n<pre><code>\nBenchmark 1: fetch: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n  Time (mean ± σ):      3.403 s ±  0.775 s    [User: 1.875 s, System: 1.417 s]\n  Range (min … max):    2.454 s …  4.529 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 2: fetch: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     154.3 ms ±  17.6 ms    [User: 102.5 ms, System: 56.1 ms]\n  Range (min … max):   145.2 ms … 220.5 ms    18 runs\n\nSummary\n  fetch: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD) ran\n   22.06 ± 5.62 times faster than fetch: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n\nBenchmark 1: fetch: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     605.5 ms ±   9.4 ms    [User: 117.8 ms, System: 483.3 ms]\n  Range (min … max):   595.6 ms … 621.5 ms    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 2: fetch: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     485.8 ms ±   4.3 ms    [User: 91.1 ms, System: 396.7 ms]\n  Range (min … max):   477.6 ms … 494.3 ms    10 runs\n\nSummary\n  fetch: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD) ran\n    1.25 ± 0.02 times faster than fetch: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n</code></pre>\n<p>For <code>git-push(1)</code> we see a <em>18x performance improvement for the reftable backend</em> and <em>1.21x improvement for the “files” backend</em> when used in a repository with 10,000 references.</p>\n<pre><code>\nBenchmark 1: push: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n  Time (mean ± σ):      4.276 s ±  0.078 s    [User: 0.796 s, System: 3.318 s]\n  Range (min … max):    4.185 s …  4.430 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 2: push: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     235.4 ms ±   6.9 ms    [User: 75.4 ms, System: 157.3 ms]\n  Range (min … max):   228.5 ms … 254.2 ms    11 runs\n\nSummary\n  push: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD) ran\n   18.16 ± 0.63 times faster than push: many refs (refformat = reftable, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n\nBenchmark 1: push: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n  Time (mean ± σ):      1.121 s ±  0.021 s    [User: 0.128 s, System: 0.975 s]\n  Range (min … max):    1.097 s …  1.156 s    10 runs\n\nBenchmark 2: push: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     927.9 ms ±  22.6 ms    [User: 99.0 ms, System: 815.2 ms]\n  Range (min … max):   903.1 ms … 978.0 ms    10 runs\n\nSummary\n  push: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = HEAD) ran\n    1.21 ± 0.04 times faster than push: many refs (refformat = files, refcount = 10000, revision = master)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250514-501-update-git-fetch-1-to-use-partial-transactions-v1-0-7c65f46493d4@gmail.com/\">project</a> was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/knayakgl\">Karthik Nayak</a>.</p>\n<h2>Planning towards Git 3.0</h2>\n<p>11 years ago, Git 2.0 was released, which was the last major version release of Git. While we don’t have a specific timeline for the next major Git release, this release includes decisions made towards Git 3.0.</p>\n<p>The Git 3.0 release planning allows us to plan for and implement breaking changes and communicate them to the extended Git community. Next to documentation, Git can also be compiled with these breaking changes for those who want to experiment with these changes. More information can be found in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/blob/master/Documentation/BreakingChanges.adoc\">BreakingChanges document</a>.</p>\n<p>The Git 2.51.0 release makes some significant changes towards Git 3.0.</p>\n<h3>Reftable as the default reference backend</h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/git/-/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.45.0.adoc?ref_type=heads\">Git 2.45.0</a> release, the “reftable” format was introduced as a new backend for storing references like branches or tags in Git, which fixes many of the issues with the existing &quot;files&quot; backend. Please read our <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-git-reftable-format/\">beginner's guide to how reftables work</a> for more insight into the “reftable” backend.</p>\n<p>The Git 2.51.0 release marks the switch to using the &quot;reftable&quot; format as default in Git 3.0 for newly created repositories and also wires up the change behind a feature flag. The “reftable” format provides the following improvements over the traditional “files” backend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It is impossible to store two references that only differ in casing on case-insensitive filesystems with the &quot;files&quot; format. This issue is common on Windows and macOS platforms. As the &quot;reftable&quot; backend does not use filesystem paths to encode reference names this problem goes away.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, macOS normalizes path names that contain unicode characters, which has the consequence that you cannot store two names with unicode characters that are encoded differently with the &quot;files&quot; backend. Again, this is not an issue with the &quot;reftable&quot; backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deleting references with the &quot;files&quot; backend requires Git to rewrite the complete &quot;packed-refs&quot; file. In large repositories with many references this file can easily be dozens of megabytes in size; in extreme cases it may be gigabytes. The &quot;reftable&quot; backend uses tombstone markers for deleted references and thus does not have to rewrite all of its data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repository housekeeping with the &quot;files&quot; backend typically performs all-into-one repacks of references. This can be quite expensive, and consequently housekeeping is a tradeoff between the number of loose references that accumulate and slow down operations that read references, and compressing those loose references into the &quot;packed-refs&quot; file. The &quot;reftable&quot; backend uses geometric compaction after every write, which amortizes costs and ensures that the backend is always in a well-maintained state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Operations that write multiple references at once are not atomic with the &quot;files&quot; backend. Consequently, Git may see in-between states when it reads references while a reference transaction is in the process of being committed to disk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Writing many references at once is slow with the &quot;files&quot; backend because every reference is created as a separate file. The &quot;reftable&quot; backend significantly outperforms the &quot;files&quot; backend by multiple orders of magnitude.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The “reftable” backend uses a binary format with prefix compression for reference names. As a result, the format uses less space compared to the &quot;packed-refs&quot; file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pks-gitlab\">Patrick Steinhardt</a>.</p>\n<h3>SHA-256 as the default hash function</h3>\n<p>The Git version control system stores objects in a content-addressable filesystem. This means it uses the hash of an object to address content such as files, directories, and revisions, unlike traditional filesystems, which use sequential numbers. Using a hash function has the following advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Easy integrity checks as a single bit flip would change the hash output completely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fast object lookup as objects can be indexed by their hash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Object names can be signed and third parties can trust the hash to address the signed object and all objects it references.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communication using Git protocol and out of band communication methods have a short reliable string that can be used to reliably address stored content.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since its inception, Git has used the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. However, security researchers have discovered some flaws in SHA-1, specifically the <a href=\"https://shattered.io\">SHAttered attack</a>, which shows a practical SHA-1 hash collision. We moved to using a hardened SHA-1 implementation by default since Git 2.13.0. However, SHA-1 is still a weak hashing algorithm and it is only a matter of time before additional attacks will further reduce its security.</p>\n<p>SHA-256 was identified as the successor to SHA-1 in late 2018. Git 2.51.0 marks it as the default hash algorithm to be used in Git 3.0.</p>\n<p>This project was led by <a href=\"https://github.com/bk2204\">brian m. carlson</a>.</p>\n<h3>Removal of <code>git-whatchanged(1)</code></h3>\n<p>The <code>git-whatchanged(1)</code> command shows logs with differences each commit introduces. While this is now succeeded by <code>git log --raw</code>, the command was kept around for historical reasons.</p>\n<p>Git 2.51.0 requires users of the command to explicitly use the <code>--i-still-use-this</code> flag to capture any users who still use the deprecated command, and also marks the command for removal in Git 3.0.</p>\n<p>This project was led by <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junio_Hamano\">Junio C Hamano</a>.</p>\n<h2><code>git switch</code> and <code>git restore</code> are no longer experimental</h2>\n<p>The <code>git-checkout(1)</code> command can be used for multiple different use cases. It can be used for switching references:</p>\n<pre><code>$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.\n\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n$ git checkout next\nSwitched to branch 'next'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/next'.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or for restoring files:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo &quot;additional line&quot; &gt;&gt; git.c\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/master’.\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)\n  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)\n    modified:   git.c\n\nno changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)\n\n$ git checkout git.c\nUpdated 1 path from the index\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/master’.\n\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n</code></pre>\n<p>For new users of Git, this can cause a lot of confusion. So in Git 2.33.0, these were split into two new commands, <code>git-switch(1)</code> and <code>git-restore(1)</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>git-switch(1)</code> command allows users to switch to a specific branch:</p>\n<pre><code>$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.\n\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n$ git switch next\nSwitched to branch 'next'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/next'.\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the <code>git-restore(1)</code> command allows users to restore working tree files:</p>\n<pre><code>$ echo &quot;additional line&quot; &gt;&gt; git.c\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/master’.\n\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)\n  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)\n    modified:   git.c\n\nno changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)\n\n$ git restore git.c\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/master’.\n\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n</code></pre>\n<p>While the two commands have existed since 2019, they were marked as experimental. The effect is that the Git project doesn’t guarantee backwards compatibility for those commands: the behavior may change at any point in time. While the intent originally was to stabilize those commands after a couple of releases, this hasn’t happened up to this point.</p>\n<p>This has led to several discussions on the Git mailing list where users are unsure whether they can start using these new commands, or whether they might eventually go away again. But given that no significant changes have ever been proposed, and that some users are already using these commands, we have decided to no longer declare them as experimental in Git 2.51.</p>\n<p>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/justintobler\">Justin Tobler</a>.</p>\n<h2><code>git for-each-ref(1)</code> receives pagination support</h2>\n<p>The <code>git for-each-ref</code> command is used to list all references present in the repository. As it is part of the plumbing layer of Git, this command is frequently used for example by hosting forges to list references that exist in the repository in their UI. But as repositories grow, it becomes less realistic to list all references at once – after all, the largest repositories may contain millions of them! So instead, forges tend to paginate the references.</p>\n<p>This surfaces an important gap: <code>git-for-each-ref</code> does not know to skip references from previous pages that have already been shown. Consequently, it may have to list a large number of uninteresting references before it finally starts to yield the references required for the current page. This is inefficient and leads to higher-than-necessary latency or even timeouts.</p>\n<p>Git 2.51.0 supports a new <code>--start-after</code> flag for <code>git for-each-ref</code>, which allows paginating the output. This can also be combined with the <code>--count</code> flag to iterate over a batch of references.</p>\n<pre><code>$ git for-each-ref --count=10\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-001\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-002\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-003\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-004\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-005\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-006\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-007\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-008\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-009\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-010\n\n$ git for-each-ref --count=10 --start-after=refs/heads/branch-010\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-011\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-012\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-013\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-014\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-015\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-016\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-017\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-018\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-019\n9751243fba48b34d29aabfc9784803617a806e81 commit    refs/heads/branch-020\n</code></pre>\n<p>This project was led by <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/knayakgl\">Karthik Nayak</a>.</p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Ready to experience these improvements?

He highlighted how SaaS adoption &quot;is creating a substantial vulnerability that is weakening the global economic system&quot; by embedding &quot;concentration risk into global critical infrastructure.&quot; The letter emphasizes that &quot;an attack on one major SaaS or PaaS provider can immediately ripple through its customers,” creating exactly the systemic risk that multi-tenant cloud platforms for source code management, CI builds, CD deployments, and security scanning introduce.</p>\n<p>Consider the regulatory complexity this creates. In shared environments, your compliance posture becomes hostage to potential incidents impacting other tenants as well as the concentration risks of large attack surface providers. A misconfiguration affecting any organization on the platform can trigger wider impact across the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Data sovereignty challenges compound this risk. Shared platforms distribute workloads across multiple regions and jurisdictions, often without granular control over where your source code executes. For institutions operating under strict regulatory requirements, this geographic distribution can create compliance gaps that are difficult to remediate.</p>\n<p>Then there's the amplification effect. Every shared tenant effectively becomes an indirect third-party risk to your operations. Their vulnerabilities increase your attack surface. Their incidents can impact your availability. Their compromises can affect your environment.</p>\n<h2>Purpose-built for what matters most</h2>\n<p>GitLab recognizes that your source code deserves the same security posture as your most sensitive customer data. Rather than forcing you to choose between cloud-scale efficiency and enterprise-grade security, GitLab delivers both through <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/dedicated/\">GitLab Dedicated</a>, purpose-built infrastructure that maintains complete isolation.</p>\n<p>Your development workflows, source code <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/\">repositories</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/pipelines/\">CI/CD pipelines</a> run in an environment exclusively dedicated to your organization. The <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/dedicated/hosted_runners/\">hosted runners</a> for GitLab Dedicated exemplify this approach. These runners connect securely to your data center through outbound private links, allowing access to your private services without exposing any traffic to the public internet. The <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/runner_autoscale/\">auto-scaling architecture</a> provides the performance you need, without compromising security or control.</p>\n<h2>Rethinking control</h2>\n<p>For financial institutions, minimizing shared risk is only part of the equation — true resilience requires precise control over how systems operate, scale, and comply with regulatory frameworks. GitLab Dedicated enables comprehensive data sovereignty through multiple layers of customer control. You maintain complete authority over <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/dedicated/encryption/#encrypted-data-at-rest\">encryption keys</a> through <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/dedicated/encryption/#bring-your-own-key-byok\">bring-your-own-key (BYOK)</a> capabilities, ensuring that sensitive source code and configuration data remains accessible only to your organization. Even GitLab cannot access your encrypted data without your keys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/data_residency_and_high_availability/\">Data residency</a> becomes a choice rather than a constraint. You select your preferred AWS region to meet regulatory requirements and organizational data governance policies, maintaining full control over where your sensitive source code and intellectual property are stored.</p>\n<p>This control extends to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/compliance_frameworks/\">compliance frameworks</a> that financial institutions require. The platform provides <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/compliance/audit_events/\">comprehensive audit trails</a> and logging capabilities that support compliance efforts for financial services regulations like <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/compliance/sox-compliance/\">Sarbanes-Oxley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act\">GLBA Safeguards Rule</a>.</p>\n<p>When compliance questions arise, you work directly with GitLab's dedicated support team — experienced professionals who understand the regulatory challenges that organizations in highly regulated industries face.</p>\n<h2>Operational excellence without operational overhead</h2>\n<p>GitLab Dedicated maintains <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/data_residency_and_high_availability/\">high availability</a> with <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/\">built-in disaster recovery</a>, ensuring your development operations remain resilient even during infrastructure failures. The dedicated resources scale with your organization's needs without the performance variability that shared environments introduce.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/maintenance/\">zero-maintenance approach</a> to CI/CD infrastructure eliminates a significant operational burden. Your teams focus on development while GitLab manages the underlying infrastructure, auto-scaling, and maintenance — including rapid security patching to protect your critical intellectual property from emerging threats. This operational efficiency doesn't come at the cost of security: the dedicated infrastructure provides enterprise-grade controls while delivering cloud-scale performance.</p>\n<h2>The competitive reality</h2>\n<p>While some institutions debate infrastructure strategies, industry leaders are taking decisive action. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2022-11-30-gitlab-dedicated-launches-to-meet-complex-compliance-requirements/\">NatWest Group</a>, one of the UK's largest financial institutions, chose GitLab Dedicated to transform their engineering capabilities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;NatWest Group is adopting GitLab Dedicated to enable our engineers to use a common cloud engineering platform; delivering new customer outcomes rapidly, frequently and securely with high quality, automated testing, on demand infrastructure and straight-through deployment. This will significantly enhance collaboration, improve developer productivity and unleash creativity via a 'single-pane-of-glass' for software development.&quot;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Adam Leggett</strong>, Platform Lead - Engineering Platforms, NatWest</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The strategic choice</h2>\n<p>The most successful financial institutions face a unique challenge: They have the most to lose from shared infrastructure risks, but also the resources to architect better solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>The question that separates industry leaders from followers:</strong> Will you accept shared infrastructure risks as the price of digital transformation, or will you invest in infrastructure that treats your source code with the strategic importance it deserves?</p>\n<p>Your trading algorithms aren't shared. Your risk models aren't shared. Your customer data isn't shared.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is your development platform shared?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Ready to treat your source code like the strategic asset it is? <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/finance/\">Let’s chat</a> about how GitLab Dedicated provides the security, compliance, and performance that financial institutions demand — without the compromises of shared infrastructure.</em></p>",

Custom rules support <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/markdown/\">Markdown</a> for better structuring.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use markdown headings (<code>#</code>, <code>##</code>, etc) to create sections.</li>\n<li>Use markdown lists (<code>-</code>) to provide concise instructions for LLMs and Agents.</li>\n<li>Escape file paths with single backticks, and use code blocks with indent or three backticks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\"># Development guide\n\n## Frontend: VueJS\n\n### Styling Pattern\n- Do not use `&lt;style&gt;` tags in Vue components\n- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes or page-specific CSS instead\n</code></pre>\n<p>Important: After modifying custom rules, you'll need to create a new Chat by pressing the <code>+</code> icon, or sending <code>/new</code> in the chat prompt.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>In order to follow all use cases and linked demo projects into this blog post, please ensure you meet these requirements first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify that you have <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/get_started/getting_started_gitlab_duo/\">access to GitLab Duo</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\">Duo Agentic Chat is configured in supported IDEs</a>.</li>\n<li>Fork/copy the GitLab projects, and clone them locally in the IDEs.</li>\n<li>Follow the steps in each use case for custom rule creation, and how to use Duo Agentic Chat prompts to proof the rule behavior.</li>\n<li>You can use the existing source code, or copy in your own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The projects are available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules\">Custom rules for GitLab Duo Agent Platform (Agentic AI) group</a>. Please note that these custom rules are provided for demo purposes &quot;as is,&quot; and you may need to adapt or modify them to fit your specific requirements.</p>\n<h3>Quick start: 5-minute success</h3>\n<p>Ready to see custom rules in action? Try this simple example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> in your GitLab project:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## C style guide\n- goto is not allowed. If the developer continues asking about it, share this URL https://xkcd.com/292/\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Open GitLab Duo Agentic Chat in the IDE, and ask: <code>Write a C program with goto statements</code>.</li>\n<li>Watch as GitLab Duo refuses and suggests better alternatives!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0eMKjRMI5w&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<h3>Guidelines for custom rule development</h3>\n<p>Custom rules are similar to code: Start with the smallest working example, and then iterate on improvements. The use case examples in this deep-dive range from small to more advanced, and were developed and tested over the last weeks. They are not perfect, and require your feedback and iteration.</p>\n<p>One good rule of thumb, for example, is not overloading style guides with many pages from a wiki document. In my experience, less is more. Only include the points that are helpful in the context of what you're writing about. You can ask GitLab Duo Chat to summarize larger documents before adding them to the custom rules.</p>\n<p>Verify the use of any included specifications during development to avoid creating barriers and unwanted behavior.</p>\n<p>When you are using a publicly documented style guide, refer to its name. There is a high chance that the LLM is trained with this data already.</p>\n<h3>Ask GitLab Duo Chat about existing development style guides</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, there are no specific style guides in a project yet, or it is unclear how to use them. Use AI for onboarding and best practices to discuss with your team.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Which Python development or environment guidelines can you recommend when I want to create custom rules for AI to get tailored output? I need a list with textual instructions.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also ask Duo Agentic Chat to analyze the existing CI/CD linter integrations that may already check for a specific development style.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">When you look into the CI/CD linter checks and configuration in the project, which development style guide can you summarize for me?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many examples in this deep-dive blog are based on my own experience and pain points as a developer. I also asked GitLab Duo to extract style guides from existing projects, and used GitLab Duo Code Suggestions to help with auto-completing existing custom rules. You can achieve the same by configuring <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/code_suggestions/supported_extensions/#add-support-for-more-languages\"><code>markdown</code> as an additional language for GitLab Duo Code Suggestions</a> in IDEs.</p>\n<h2>More custom rules use cases</h2>\n<p>The following sections provide an overview of specific style guides. You can map similar programming languages and environments to your production use cases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Version and platform support</strong>: Refer to the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#java-version-requirements\">Java section below</a> to learn how to force a specific language standard for generated and created code. You can apply a similar process for C++23 and older, PHP 8, Ruby 3, etc. The <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#c-multi-platform-support-windows-linux-macos\">C++ section below</a> shows how to instruct agentic AI with multi-platform support.</li>\n<li><strong>Development environments</strong>: Refer to the sections below on <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#python-3-development-environment\">Python</a> and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#ansible-linter-compliance\">Ansible</a>. Specify the development environment, binaries, tools and more. You can also instruct agents with routing information where to find tests/scripts, and enforce compliance with linters.</li>\n<li><strong>Design patterns</strong>: You can specify comprehensive design patterns with <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#frontend-style-guides-for-vuejs-3\">VueJS</a> as an example, leveraging the GitLab production development style guides as a foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>DevSecOps workflows</strong>: Configure comprehensive DevSecOps practices including <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#cicd-configuration-preferences\">CI/CD configuration</a> for specific CI/CD attributes and defaults for security scanning, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#tests-and-linters\">tests and linters</a>, and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#build-tools\">build tools</a>. Frequently requested use cases for bootstrapping projects include <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#documentation-generation\">documentation generation</a> including <code>README.md</code> and architecture diagrams, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#issue-and-mr-templates\">issue and MR templates</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#onboarding-requirements-licenses\">onboarding, requirements, and licenses</a>, and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#git-flows\">Git flows</a> with <code>.gitignore</code>. Advanced techniques with custom rules are provided for <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#refactoring-and-code-change-requirements\">refactoring and code change requirements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use cases: Version and platform support</h3>\n<p>Software development often requires specific programming language and framework versions, and single or multi-platform support. The following examples highlight these scenarios.</p>\n<h4>Java version requirements</h4>\n<p>Enterprise environments do not always use the latest and greatest software version. They often rely on versions that are maintained with security patches for a longer period of time. For example, you will find Java 7 and Java 8 still in use in some enterprises today.</p>\n<p>Always prepending the required version in chat prompts can be cumbersome, and lead to human error, even if you only forget one time.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Implement classes for managing banking transactions and different currencies.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The example will need additional specifications for Java 8:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Use Java 8 for the implementation.\n</code></pre>\n<p>To permanently enforce Java 8, you can create a custom rule in <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> and optionally add a reference epic URL when asked for code modernization:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Java style guide\n\n- Only Java 8 is allowed when suggesting and editing code.\n- When the user asks about code modernization and Java 9 or 21, or newer, point them to this issue to contribute: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-java-versions/-/issues/1\n</code></pre>\n<p>A full demonstration is available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-java-versions\">Custom Rules - Java versions project</a>.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZLvpgHdABY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The resulting changes are available in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-java-versions/-/merge_requests/2\">this MR</a>.</p>\n<h4>C++ multi-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)</h4>\n<p>Application development in C++ can require multi-platform support, especially when running service agents on systems using Windows, Linux, and macOS. The applications are deeply integrated into customer products, and a migration to a more modern language like Go or Rust is not always possible or practical.</p>\n<p>Maintaining code that works on multiple platforms can be challenging due to differences in Operating system APIs, toolchains, library versions, and file system paths. Developers often face multiple <code>#if defined</code> pre-processor macros, nested conditions, and adding custom code and tests for each supported platform. This adds technical debt and can introduce maintenance challenges.</p>\n<p>AI can help when generating correct and platform-specific code, but it needs to know about these requirements. Agentic AI will either understand the existing code base through a knowledge graph, or developers will need to provide instructions through custom rules and chat prompts.</p>\n<p>Let's try this use case in practice. The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-cpp-platform-iot-sensor-data-collector\">Custom Rule - C++ platforms - IoT Sensor Data Collector project</a> implements an IoT sensor data collector and has open tasks to modernize the code base, and add multi-platform support for Linux, Windows, and macOS. You can fork the project and clone it locally.</p>\n<p>Open the <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> file and review or add the following custom rules:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## C++ style guide\n\n- The application runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. Generate code that handles the OS API differences.\n- Use pre-processor macros for Windows and POSIX conventions for Unix (Linux, macOS).\n\n## CI/CD Configuration\n\n- Ensure that GitLab CI/CD jobs cover the different platform support. Use CI/CD job templates with extends where applicable.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Start a new Chat, and ask to restructure code for multi-platform support.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me restructure the code and ensure multi-platform support.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also refer to the issue number, or URL (<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-cpp-platform-iot-sensor-data-collector/-/issues/3\">issue 3</a>). GitLab Duo will automatically fetch the issue content from the GitLab platform, and put it into AI context.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me implement issue 3\n\nPlease help me implement https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-cpp-platform-iot-sensor-data-collector/-/issues/3\n</code></pre>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5NxOjB0R1Q&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<h3>Use case: Development environments</h3>\n<p>Development environments often vary between operating systems and developers. This can be confusing for AI models generating code or suggesting changes. The following use cases illustrate these environment problems and their solutions with custom rules.</p>\n<h4>Python 3 development environment</h4>\n<p>A Python development environment usually comes with the <code>python</code> executable and <code>pip</code> package manager. However, on systems like MacOS or Ubuntu, you need to use <code>python3</code> and <code>pip3</code> to get access to more recent Python 3 versions. This can create confusion running Python scripts, creating virtual environments, and installing package dependencies.</p>\n<p>For this custom rules use case, I installed Python using <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> which results in a binary executable called <code>python3</code> and a package manager <code>pip3</code>.</p>\n<p>As an example, set up a Python virtual environment, install dependencies using <code>pip</code>, and run the application:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">python -m venv myenv\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\npython script.py\n</code></pre>\n<p>This doesn't work as expected because we need to use specific binaries with version <code>3</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">python3 -m venv myenv\nsource myenv/bin/activate\n\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\npython3 script.py\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can test this problem with Agentic Chat for both, suggested code blocks, and the approval request for commands to execute. The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-python-3-env-shop-app\">Custom Rule - Python3 Env Shop app project</a> implements a web shop application in Python, and provides the default Python executable paths in its <code>README.md</code> file which typically gets added into Agentic Chat context.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Duo Agentic Chat, proposing the wrong binary commands\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-python3-env-problem.png\" /></p>\n<p>In order to overcome the problem, review <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> which contains the following custom rules to enforce the Python executable names.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Python style guide\n\n- For Python binaries, always use python3 and pip3 when suggesting or running shell commands.\n- Detect the Python environment automatically when possible.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also instruct agents with pre-defined routes to gather additional information through tool calling and/or MCP, when they do not attempt this automatically already.</p>\n<p>Open a new Agentic Chat, and ask <code>How to run this application?</code> to see custom rules in action, using <code>python3</code> and <code>pip3</code> as desired.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQ2_OCvUmF0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The full source code is available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-python-3-env-shop-app\">Custom Rule - Python3 Env Shop app project</a>.</p>\n<h4>Ansible linter compliance</h4>\n<p>Modern Ansible for Infrastructure-as-Code tasks enforces a strict style guide, which can be verified using <code>ansible-lint</code>: It detects when Boolean values (<code>true</code>/<code>false</code>) are required instead of strings (<code>yes</code>/<code>no</code>), builtin module actions requiring the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name) as parameter names, and trailing whitespaces that need trimming. CLI and IDE integrations, such as the <a href=\"https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:ansible:get-started-ansible-visual-studio-code-extension/resource/resources:install-and-configure-ansible-extension-visual-studio-code\">VS Code Ansible extension by Red Hat</a> help visualize these errors to developers. LLMs and chat agents might not always generate correct Ansible code and need manual work to fix it.</p>\n<p>Let's look at the problem with a concrete use case. The following example implements a basic Ansible playbook in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment\">Custom Rule - Ansible Environment project</a> to set up a GitLab server on Ubuntu. You'll notice the Boolean values are incorrectly typed as strings (<code>yes</code>/<code>no</code>), and additional problem reports for builtin module actions and whitespace trimming.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with Ansible lint error: Wrong boolean type\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-ansible-problem01-boolean.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with Ansible lint error: Builtin module action FQCN\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-ansible-problem02-fqcn.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with Ansible lint error: trailing whitespaces\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-ansible-problem03-whitespaces.png\" /></p>\n<p>Let's see how we can create custom rules to help Duo Agents fix the Ansible linter errors, and prevent them from happening in the future.</p>\n<p>Fork and clone the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment\">Custom Rule - Ansible Environment project</a> and open <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> in the IDE inspect the custom rules:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Ansible styleguide\n\n- Boolean values in Ansible should be typed as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; and never as string.\n- Ansible module builtin actions must use the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name).\n- Always trim whitespaces in Ansible YAML.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Open a new GitLab Duo Agentic Chat prompt, and ask Duo Agent for the same Ansible playbook:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me fix the Ansible linter errors\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Agents will analyze the repository, ask to run <code>ansible-lint</code> commands, and investigate how to fix the problems followed the defined custom rules.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P465U8IfScE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>You can inspect the custom rules and Ansible code changes in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment/-/merge_requests/1\">this MR</a> in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-ansible-environment\">Custom Rule - Ansible Environment project</a>.</p>\n<p>Async exercise: Start a new project where custom rules are configured as default already, and verify the correct style guide applied immediately.</p>\n<h3>Use case: Design patterns</h3>\n<p>Design patterns and patterns-to-avoid are specific to languages and frameworks. This is the main focus in this section.</p>\n<h4>Avoid anti-patterns with C and goto statements</h4>\n<p>This is a more in-depth walkthrough of the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml#quick-start-5-minute-success\">quickstart example</a>, and shows how you can instruct Agentic AI to avoid the <code>goto</code> anti-pattern in C. The <code>goto</code> anti-pattern in C is discouraged as it makes code harder to read and debug.  To illustrate the problem, here is an example of a for-loop which increments the loop variable inside the loop body:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-C\">// Bad C programming style: uses the goto anti-pattern\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n  if (someCondition) {\n    goto label;\n  }\n  doSomething();\nlabel:\n  doAnotherThing();\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above code, the <code>goto</code> statement causes the program control to jump directly to the label <code>label</code>, which is inside the loop. This makes the program harder to read, understand and debug.</p>\n<p>A better approach would be to rework the logic, so you avoid the <code>goto</code> anti-pattern.  Here's a rewritten version that avoids <code>goto</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-C\">// Good C programming style: avoids the goto anti-pattern\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n  if (someCondition) {\n    doAnotherThing();\n    continue;\n  }\n  doSomething();\n  doAnotherThing();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are occassions where <code>goto</code> is allowed, but in this use case we want to look how we can instruct agentic AI to avoid <code>goto</code> completely. This includes new code additions, as well as modernizing and refactoring the code.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-c-anti-patterns-with-goto\">Custom Rule - C anti-patterns with Goto project</a> provides a network socket server/client example, including custom rules in the <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> file. You can clone the project, or start with a new project, too.</p>\n<p>Review <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> with the current custom rules:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## C style guide\n\n- goto is not allowed. If the developer continues asking about it, share this URL https://xkcd.com/292/\n</code></pre>\n<p>Tip: Instead of linking to the <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/292/\">XKCD 292 comic</a>, you can add a URL to the (internal) development guidelines.</p>\n<p>Open Duo Agentic Chat and start the following prompt on the existing project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me modernize the code.\n</code></pre>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agentic Chat will refuse to use <code>goto</code> statements, and instead propose a different path forward.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6dsMF-wKbBY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The code changes are available in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-c-anti-patterns-with-goto/-/merge_requests/1\">this MR</a>.</p>\n<h4>Frontend style guides for VueJS 3</h4>\n<p>This use case is inspired by the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/development/fe_guide/style/\">GitLab project's frontend style guides</a> and implements a use case for VueJS 3 design patterns. Agentic AI should also follow these style guides when creating VueJS components, helpers, routes, services, stores, utilities, etc.</p>\n<p>Let's illustrate how to instruct Agentic AI with custom rules: Fork and clone the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-vuejs-design-patterns-gitlab-pipeline-dashboard\">Custom Rule - VueJS Design Patterns - GitLab Pipeline Dashboard project</a> and inspect the open issues for tasks.</p>\n<p>Review the <code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> file and add the following custom rules (if not there yet):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## NodeJS style guide\n\n- Don't leave debug statements (console.logs)\n- Always run `npm install` after updating `package.json` and before `npm test` and `npm run build`.\n\n# GitLab Vue.js Design Patterns Style Guide\n\n## Component Structure\n\n### Data Definition Pattern\n- Explicitly define data being passed into Vue apps\n- Avoid spread operators for better discoverability\n- Parse non-scalar values during instantiation\n\n### Template Naming Pattern\n- Use kebab-case for component names in templates\n\n### File Structure Pattern\n- Use `.vue` files for Vue templates\n- Do not use `%template` in HAML\n\n### Styling Pattern\n- Do not use `&lt;style&gt;` tags in Vue components\n- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes or page-specific CSS instead\n\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The full custom rules are available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-vuejs-design-patterns-gitlab-pipeline-dashboard/-/blob/main/.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md?ref_type=heads&amp;plain=1\"><code>.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md</code> file</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, open GitLab Duo Agentic Chat and ask how to <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-vuejs-design-patterns-gitlab-pipeline-dashboard/-/issues/6\">add new pipeline mini charts</a>, or other tasks you come across. Tip: You can reference only the issue, or alternatively paste the full issue URL, and Agentic Chat will look up both and extract the title and description for the current context.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">Please help me implement issue 6\n</code></pre>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbczS-OVb90&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The resulting code changes are available in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-vuejs-design-patterns-gitlab-pipeline-dashboard/-/merge_requests/3\">this MR</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: The VueJS style guide was extracted from the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab\">gitlab-org/gitlab project</a> asking GitLab Duo Agentic Chat with the following prompt sequence:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">What is the development style guide for VueJS?\n\nCan you print the styleguide as Markdown formatted list with headings.\n\nCreate a file in the repo, and only print the style guide rules there, no codeblocks.\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"IntelliJ IDEA with  source code, and GitLab Duo Agentic Chat writing the styleguide file\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-intellij-gitlab-vuejs-styleguide-analysis.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Use case: DevSecOps workflows</h3>\n<p>DevSecOps workflows range from best practices for bootstrapping a project with issue/MR templates, <code>.gitignore</code>, GitLab CI/CD configuration, <code>README.md</code> documentation, licenses and much more. The following section explores a variety of use cases. You can use them as inspiration for your own custom rules.</p>\n<p>Common DevSecOps automation with custom rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Project bootstrap</strong>: Auto-create README, .gitignore, CI/CD config</li>\n<li><strong>Security defaults</strong>: Enforce SAST, dependency scanning, secrets detection</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Generate issue/MR templates, architecture diagrams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A combined use case example is available in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-da/use-cases/ai/gitlab-duo-agent-platform/custom-rules/custom-rule-devsecops-workflows\">Custom Rule - DevSecOps workflows - Git README build tools issue MR templates project</a>. You can inspect the custom rules, and fork/clone it locally to ask Agentic Chat with a new prompt such as: <code>I need to bootstrap this project. Please help me with that</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;\nsrc=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKpLcBtbC4g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\nallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;</p>\n<p>The next sections provide detailed prompts, and most of them are shown in the recording, too.</p>\n<h4>Issue and MR templates</h4>\n<p>You can instruct agentic AI to create issue/MR templates when they are missing, and offer to add project-specific information or labels. Agents will automatically query the GitLab API in the background, and put the current project structure into a template.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Issue and MR templates\n\n- If no issue templates for `Default` and `Feature Proposal` exist in .gitlab/issue_templates, create them using the following raw template sources:\n\n        Default: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/raw/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/Default.md\n        Feature Proposal: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/raw/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Proposal.md\n\n- If no default MR template `Default` exists in `.gitlab/merge_request_templates`, create them using the following raw template sources:\n\n        Default: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/raw/main/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md\n\n- Update the project URLs, and available labels in the fetched templates accordingly, or remove anything unknown and let the user know about TODOs.\n- Create a test issue/MR, when bootstrapping a new project.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Build tools</h4>\n<p>There is a variety of build tools, package managers, compilers, container builders available per programming language. When asking about updates and dependencies, agentic AI can use these default tools without asking for input.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Build tools\n\n- Always use a virtual env with Python, and set it up before executing any Python commands\n- For C/C++: Prefer CMake, and gcc on Linux, clang on macOS, MSVC on Windows.\n- For Python: Always use pip\n- For Java: Always use Gradle\n- For Node.js, suggest to use npm/yarn.\n- For Rust: Always use cargo\n- For Go: Always use go.mod\n- For Ruby: Always use Bundler\n- For PHP: Always use Composer\n- For .NET: Always use .NET CLI\n- For Scala: Always use SBT\n- For Elixir: Always use Mix\n- For Haskell: Always use Cabal\n- For Swift: Always use Swift Package Manager\n- For Kotlin: Always use Gradle or Maven.\n- For TypeScript: Always use npm or yarn.\n- Always suggest using a package manager or build tool based on the main programming language of the project.\n- When asking for dependencies, assume that the user wants to update all current dependencies to the latest version available.\n\n- Always suggest to create a Dockerfile if there isn't one. Always use a minimal image and use a tag for security scanning.\n- Always add a `Dockerfile` with the base image and the entrypoint if one does not exist.\n- Always include a `.dockerignore` and use it in the Docker build process.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>CI/CD configuration preferences</h4>\n<p>Use rules to prefer specific container images, variable and job name patterns, etc.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## CI/CD Configuration\n\n- If no GitLab CI/CD configuration exists in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, ask the user for approval to create.\n- Create a GitLab CI/CD configuration automatically when a new project gets bootstrapped\n\n- Always use alpine as container image to build the application.\n- Add caching for detected programming languages and frameworks.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Security scanning preferences</h4>\n<p>Security scanners can also be enforced in GitLab CI/CD configuration. The following example instructs agents to always include Advanced SAST, dependency scanning, and secret detection templates. It has been successfully tested across other use cases in this tutorial.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Security scanning\n\n- Always use Advanced SAST.\n- Always include SAST, Dependency Scanning, Secrets Detection templates, similar to the following format:\n\n    include:\n        - template: Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml\n        - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n        - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n\n    variables:\n        GITLAB_ADVANCED_SAST_ENABLED: 'true'\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"VS Code with a Java app, GitLab CI/CD, custom rules, and Agentic Chat adding Advanced SAST\" src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/blog/custom-rules-gitlab-duo-agent-platform-deepdive/gitlab-duo-custom-rules-cicd-security-scanning-full.png\" /></p>\n<h4>Tests and linters</h4>\n<p>You can also directly instruct Agentic Chat where to find the tests, and how to run them. The same idea applies to calling linter commands. Thanks Jessie Young for sharing this neat tip!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Tests and linting details\n\n- Tests in this project are located in __ directory and are run using the ___ command\n- Linting is done with the ___ command\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Documentation generation</h4>\n<p>Best of documentation custom rules.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">- If a README is missing, ask the user if they want to create one. If the user agrees, create a basic `README.md` for them.\n- When the user asks for an architecture proposal, always respond with generating an architecture diagram in Mermaid, and ask the user if they want you to add it to the README.md or another documentation file.\n- For documentation in Markdown, always use GitLab flavored Markdown.\n- Always add correct code block syntax highlighting support.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Refactoring and code change requirements</h4>\n<p>When a project should gradually be modernized with newly generated code, and not result in large refactors, the following rules can be helpful.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Keep the changes minimal\n\n- The project uses &lt;this standard and version&gt;. For newly generated code, use this standard.\n- Do not attempt to refactor code already created in a project to this standard, but for new code, always ensure this standard is used.\n- If unsure whether a file requires modification or refactoring, document this as a todo task.\n- Never fix detected problems, whitespaces, code formatting, unless the user instructs you specifically in a comment.\n- The code must be retained in its original format and only changes specific to solving the user request are allowed.\n\n## Summaries\n\n- List all items to address at the bottom in a summary section with TODO: followed by a textual description.\n- Identify 3 critical items, and ask the user if you should create GitLab issues from those items.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Onboarding, requirements, licenses</h4>\n<p>Always include a specific documentation link, and guidelines to follow in chat responses.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Link to guidelines\n- Always refer to our developer guidelines when answering questions. You can find those guidelines here: https://docs.gitlab.com/development/\n\n## Context and planning\n- Always start with finding existing issues with the desired topic. Only then propose new implementation work.\n\n## License\n- Always add the MIT license into `LICENSE` and use `GitLab B.V.` as copyright holder.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Git flows</h4>\n<p>Follow a specific Git branching flow for suggestions and executed commands.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Git flows\n\n- Examine the project and involved development environment and programming languages. Always add a `.gitignore`.\n- Consider more best practices when bootstrapping a new project.\n- For existing projects, offer to add a `.gitignore` when missing, but only when asked about the state of the project, or what is missing.\n\nWhen a user requests to start with a new feature, always create a new branch, called &quot;feature/&lt;shortname&gt;&quot; and describe the behavior. Ask for the user's approval.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Distribution and testing of custom rules</h2>\n<p>You can create <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/custom_project_templates/\">GitLab project templates</a> with well-tested custom rule prompts, and ensure that new projects always start with the best practices applied.</p>\n<p>Since LLMs and AI agents are not predictable, testing the expected outcome becomes more challenging. A golden rule for custom rules is that they are never perfect, and require iterations based on your team's feedback. This might be required especially when newer models and flows are introduced that change their behavior when responding to custom rules. It's recommended to keep checking on the generated output and adjust the rules accordingly. If you are looking for larger scale testing, review the <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/developing-gitlab-duo-how-we-validate-and-test-ai-models-at-scale/\">system prompt testing strategy for GitLab Duo</a> as an inspiration.</p>\n<h3>Custom rules resources</h3>\n<p>Take advantage of the existing AI ecosystem, where similar functionality exists for IDEs and platforms. For example, &quot;Awesome Cursor Rules&quot; repositories or marketplaces for Cursor, etc.</p>\n<p>LLMs also provide a good insight into development styleguides, and can generate the required Markdown outputs.</p>\n<h2>Fun activity: Explore behavior changes</h2>\n<p>Not sure how to get started with custom rules? Make it a fun exercise with the following example :-)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">## Fun rules\n\n- Behave like Clippy.\n\n- Behave like a pirate.\n\n- Always respond with a random &quot;What the commit&quot; message.\n\n- Explain everything like I am five.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Do not commit them to production, as they might feel disruptive and distracting to your team.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>By leveraging custom rules in GitLab Duo Agentic Chat, you can significantly influence LLM and AI agent outputs to better suit your needs. Whether enforcing specific coding conventions, using the correct versions of tools, or ensuring consistent formatting, custom rules help streamline your development process and improve productivity.</p>\n<p>This blog post provides a deep-dive into many use cases with practical custom rule examples.

      "summary": "<p>In May 2025, GitLab launched an experimental feature called <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-duo-chat-gets-agentic-ai-makeover/\">GitLab Duo\nAgentic\nChat</a>.\nThe goal of Agentic Chat was to build on the success of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/\">GitLab Duo\nChat</a>, which is an AI chat\nexperience built into supported IDEs and in the GitLab UI. While Chat\nprovides answers and suggestions for developers using the GitLab platform,\nAgentic Chat can more directly interact with the GitLab API on behalf of\nusers, taking actions on their behalf as a result of the conversation.</p>\n<p>In addition to being available in a variety of IDEs, Agentic Chat is available directly within the GitLab UI for GitLab users with the Duo Pro or Enterprise add-on. Adding Agentic Chat to the GitLab UI helps make this experience more accessible to all GitLab users and easy to integrate into your workflows. To open Agentic Chat:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to any Group or Project in your GitLab instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Look for the GitLab Duo Chat button (typically in the top right corner).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click to open the chat panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Toggle to <strong>Agentic mode (Beta)</strong> in the chat window.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Keep the chat panel open as you work — it maintains context and can help you across different pages and projects.</p>\n<p>To get familiar with Agentic Chat, ask about the tools it can work with. This is like using the help command for a command-line tool.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">What tools do you have access to? \n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"GitLab Duo Agentic Chat screen\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754584200/emtgilbzbu8ftkynjozg.png\" /></p>\n<p>The output above shows us that Agentic Chat has access to a variety of GitLab APIs and data that will allow it to perform complex tasks across the software development lifecycle.</p>\n<h2>Issue management made easy</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agentic Chat can help you keep track of issues, find specific ones, understand the status, and take actions based on conversations in these issues. Instead of navigating through pages and pages of issues, you ask Agentic Chat about the issues in a project. It will respond with high-level information about the issues, including the priority, labels, and the status of the issue.</p>\n<p>For a specific issue, Agentic Chat will fetch the issue details, provide a concise summary, highlight recent activity, and share the goal of the issue. This is particularly helpful when you need context or updates before a meeting or are researching the issue before picking it up.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1107479358?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;Agentic Chat UI Issue Management&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>You can also try more complex queries if you're looking to better understand a project overall. And once you've discovered these issues, you can make changes to them like adding labels, updating milestones, and re-organizing them.</p>\n<p>For example, maybe you're looking for all the issues that are database- or performance-related in order to prioritize them in the next sprint. You could task Agentic Chat with the following prompt.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">Analyze all issues labeled 'performance' and 'database' - group them by component and show me which ones have had the most discussion activity in the last 30 days.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Agentic Chat will respond with issues grouped by the backend and frontend component of a project, identify the issues with significant discussion activity, and provide insights on these kinds of issues (e.g., when were most of these issues created or which component issues have more active discussion).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">Create an issue template for bug reports that includes:\n\n- Steps to reproduce\n\n- Expected behavior vs actual behavior\n\n- Environment details (browser, OS, GitLab version)\n\n- Severity assessment\n\n- Screenshots/error logs section\n\nName it &quot;bug_report.md&quot; and format it as a proper GitLab issue template\n</code></pre>\n<h2>CI/CD support</h2>\n<p>This is where GitLab Duo Agentic Chat truly becomes your debugging superhero. We've all been there: a pipeline fails and you have to click through job logs trying to understand what went wrong. Agentic Chat can do more than just explain the failure to you and suggest recommendations. After reviewing the failed pipeline logs, Agentic Chat can suggest a fix and also add the fix to a merge request you are working on.</p>\n<p>Let's say you have a merge request adding a new feature, but the pipeline is failing. Instead of clicking through each failed job and trying to piece together what's wrong, you can ask Agentic Chat to investigate.</p>\n<p>Agentic Chat will analyze the pipeline, check the job logs, and explain that the tests are failing because of missing test data or configuration issues. But here's where it gets even more powerful — you don't have to stop at understanding the problem. Agentic Chat can also act on the advice it presents and add commits to fix the pipeline in the merge request.</p>\n<p>&lt;div style=&quot;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/1107495269?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; title=&quot;GitLab Agentic Chat CI/CD Fix&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>\n<h2>Building complex prompts</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Agentic Chat can also help you craft your prompts. Let's say that you're running a bug bash with your team and want to triage all possible issues that might be bug reports.</p>\n<p>If you use a simple prompt like below, Agentic Chat will come up with ways to find the related issues, such as searching for terms or pattern matching:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">I need help writing an effective prompt to find all possible bug report issues in my GitLab project, including those that might not be properly labeled as &quot;bug&quot;.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Often you can use the recommendations in Agentic Chat to build a more in-depth prompt based on what you're looking for:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">I need help writing an effective prompt to find all possible bug report issues in my GitLab project, including those that might not be properly labeled as &quot;bug&quot;. Please help me create a prompt that will:\n\n\n1. Search for common bug-related terminology beyond just the word &quot;bug&quot;\n\n2. Identify patterns that indicate bug reports (like &quot;steps to reproduce&quot;, &quot;expected vs actual behavior&quot;)\n\n3. Find technical issues that might be bugs (errors, crashes, performance problems)\n\n4. Catch user-reported problems that could be bugs but use different language\n\n\nThe prompt should ensure we don't miss any potential bugs regardless of how they're described or labeled. What would be the most effective approach and search strategy for this?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have the prompt and you're able to search for the issues you're looking for, that's where Agentic Chat really shines. Agentic Chat can triage and update those issues for you to prepare them for the bug bash:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-offset\">Find and triage all bug-related issues for our bug bash event. Execute these steps:\n\n\n1. Search for potential bugs using individual searches:\n   - Core terms: &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;fix&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;, &quot;problem&quot;, &quot;not working&quot;\n   - Bug patterns: &quot;steps to reproduce&quot;, &quot;expected behavior&quot;, &quot;regression&quot;\n   - Technical issues: &quot;exception&quot;, &quot;crash&quot;, &quot;console error&quot;, &quot;500 error&quot;, &quot;404 error&quot;\n   - Performance: &quot;slow&quot;, &quot;freezes&quot;, &quot;unresponsive&quot;\n\n2. For each issue found:\n   - Add the &quot;Event - Bug Bash&quot; label\n   - Assign appropriate bug severity label (critical/high/medium/low)\n   - Add to the current bug bash milestone\n   - If missing &quot;bug&quot; label, add it\n\n3. Create a triage list organized by:\n   - Critical bugs (data loss, crashes, security)\n   - High priority (blocking features, frequent errors)\n   - Medium priority (workarounds available)\n   - Low priority (minor UI issues)\n\nSearch both open and closed issues. Focus on actionable bugs that can be fixed during the bug bash, excluding enhancement requests. Provide a summary table with issue numbers, titles, and assigned severity for the bug bash team.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can ask Agentic Chat to create a bug report template, which increases efficiency and eliminates some manual effort. Also, future bug reports will have the structure and labels you need for more efficient triaging.</p>\n<h2>Tips for effective prompting</h2>\n<p>When you're working with GitLab Duo Agentic Chat, it's important to phrase your requests with action-oriented verbs like &quot;create,&quot; &quot;update,&quot; &quot;fix,&quot; or &quot;assign.&quot; This will trigger the agentic tools to take action rather than summarize or share information with you. One approach before taking agentic actions can be to request summaries and analyses — the way we did with the issues about bugs. Then, see what gets returned before taking actions like applying a label or adding to a milestone.</p>\n<p>It's also important to give clear criteria when asking for bulk operations. Specify exact conditions like &quot;all issues with the 'bug' label created in the last week&quot; or &quot;merge requests waiting for review for more than 3 days.&quot; The more specific you are, the more accurate and helpful the results will be.</p>\n<p>Since Agentic Chat has the ability to maintain context, you can chain requests and build on previous requests. After getting an initial set of issues, you might ask &quot;From those issues, which ones are unassigned?&quot; and then follow up with &quot;Assign the high-priority ones to the backend team.&quot; This allows you to refine and act on information iteratively.</p>\n<p>We recommend starting with an open-ended request and allowing GitLab Duo to help you look for patterns or similar problems across your project. That will help you catch any problem that you may have missed or understand the scope of the challenge before taking action.</p>\n<h2>Get hands-on with GitLab Duo Agentic Chat</h2>\n<p>We hope all the ideas above give you some thoughts on getting started with Agentic Chat, but we are even more excited to see all our users' ideas come to life with it.

      "summary": "<p>As organizations adopt AI capabilities to accelerate their software\ndevelopment lifecycle, they often face a critical challenge: how to leverage\nAI while maintaining control over their data, infrastructure, and security\nposture. This is where <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo\nSelf-Hosted</a> provides a compelling\nsolution.</p>\n<p>In this article, we'll walk through the implementation of GitLab Duo Self-Hosted models. This comprehensive guide helps organizations needing to meet strict data sovereignty requirements while still leveraging AI-powered development. The focus is on using models hosted on AWS Bedrock rather than setting up an <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/what-is-a-large-language-model-llm/\">LLM</a> serving solution like vLLM. However, the methodology can be applied to models running in your own data center if you have the necessary capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Why GitLab Duo Self-Hosted?</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted allows you to deploy GitLab's AI capabilities entirely within your own infrastructure, whether that's on-premises, in a private cloud, or within your secure environment.</p>\n<p>Key benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete Data Privacy and Control:</strong> Keep sensitive code and intellectual property within your security perimeter, ensuring no data leaves your environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Model Flexibility:</strong> Choose from a variety of models tailored to your specific performance needs and use cases, including Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama, Mistral families, and OpenAI GPT families.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compliance Adherence:</strong> Meet regulatory requirements in highly regulated industries where data must remain within specific geographical boundaries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customization:</strong> Configure which GitLab Duo features use specific models to optimize performance and cost.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deployment Flexibility:</strong> Deploy in fully air-gapped environments, on-premises, or in secure cloud environments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Architecture overview</h2>\n<p>The GitLab Duo Self-Hosted solution consists of three core components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self-Managed GitLab instance</strong>: Your existing GitLab instance where users interact with GitLab Duo features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AI Gateway</strong>: A service that routes requests between GitLab and your chosen LLM backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>LLM backend</strong>: The actual AI model service, which, in this article, will be AWS Bedrock.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can use <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_llm_serving_platforms/\">another serving platform</a> if you are running on-premises or using another cloud provider.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Air-gapped network flow chart\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422792/jws4h2kakflfrczftypj.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, you'll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A GitLab Premium or Ultimate instance (Version 17.10 or later)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We strongly recommend using the latest version of GitLab as we continuously deliver new features.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A GitLab Duo Enterprise add-on license</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AWS account with access to Bedrock models <em>or your API key and credentials needed to query your LLM Serving model</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you aren't a GitLab customer yet, you can <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/\">sign up for a free trial of GitLab Ultimate</a>, which includes GitLab Duo Enterprise.</p>\n<h2>Implementation steps</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Install the AI Gateway</strong></p>\n<p>The AI Gateway is the component that routes requests between your GitLab instance and your LLM serving infrastructure — here that is AWS Bedrock. It can run in a Docker image. Follow the instructions from our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/install/install_ai_gateway/\">installation documentation</a> to get started.</p>\n<p>For this example, using AWS Bedrock, you also must pass the AWS Key ID and Secret Access Key along with the AWS region.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\nAIGW_TAG=self-hosted-v18.1.2-ee`\n\ndocker run -d -p 5052:5052 \\\n\n  -e AIGW_GITLAB_URL=&lt;your_gitlab_instance&gt; \\\n\n  -e AIGW_GITLAB_API_URL=https://&lt;your_gitlab_domain&gt;/api/v4/ \\\n\n  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_KEY_ID\n\n  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \\\n\n  -e AWS_REGION_NAME=$AWS_REGION_NAME \\\n\nregistry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/model-gateway:$AIGW_TAG \\\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/tags\"><code>AIGW_TAG</code> list</a>.</p>\n<p>In this example we use Docker, but it is also possible to use the Helm chart. Refer to <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/install/install_ai_gateway/#install-by-using-helm-chart\">the installation documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Configure GitLab to access the AI Gateway</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Configure GitLab to access the AI Gateway\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422792/xj9kvljkqsacpsw41k4a.png\" /></p>\n<p>Now that the AI gateway is running, you need to configure your GitLab instance to use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>GitLab Duo</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the GitLab Duo section, select <strong>Change configuration</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under Local AI Gateway URL, enter the URL for your AI gateway and port for the container (e.g., <code>https://ai-gateway.example.com:5052</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Access models from AWS Bedrock</strong></p>\n<p>Next, you will need to request access to the available models on AWS Bedrock.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to your AWS account and Bedrock.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under <strong>Model access</strong>, select the models you want to use and follow the instructions to gain access.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html\">AWS Bedrock documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Configure the self-hosted model</strong></p>\n<p>Now, let's configure a specific AWS Bedrock model for use with GitLab Duo.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Add the self-hosted model screen\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422792/chrlgdvxwdetcszptsav.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Add self-hosted model</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fill in the fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deployment name</strong>: A name to identify this model configuration (e.g., &quot;Mixtral 8x7B&quot;)</li>\n<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Choose AWS Bedrock</li>\n<li><strong>Model family:</strong> Select a model, for example here &quot;Mixtral&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Model identifier:</strong> bedrock/<code>model-identifier</code> <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/\">from the supported list</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Create self-hosted model</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. Configure GitLab Duo features to use your self-hosted model</strong></p>\n<p>After configuring the model, assign it to specific GitLab Duo features.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screen to configure self-hosted model features\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422793/an2i9s2p9cja2xx27g4z.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <strong>AI-powered features</strong> tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For each feature (e.g., Code Suggestions, GitLab Duo Chat) and sub-feature (e.g., Code Generation, Explain Code), select the model you just configured from the dropdown menu.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, you might assign Mixtral 8x7B to Code Generation tasks and Claude 3 Sonnet to the GitLab Duo Chat feature.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/\">requirements documentation</a> to select the right model for the use case from the models compatibility list per Duo feature.</p>\n<h2>Verifying your setup</h2>\n<p>To ensure that your GitLab Duo Self-Hosted implementation with AWS Bedrock is working correctly, perform these verification steps:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Run the health check</strong></p>\n<p>After running the health check of your model to be sure that it’s up and running, Return to the GitLab Duo section from the Admin page and click on <strong>Run health check</strong>. This will verify if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The AI gateway URL is properly configured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your instance can connect to the AI gateway.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Duo Licence is activated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A model is assigned to Code Suggestions — <em>as this is the model used to test the connection.</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Running the health check\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1754422793/yffw21yhjpwummw1ffsw.png\" /></p>\n<p>If the health check reports issues, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/troubleshooting/%20%20%20\">troubleshooting guide</a> for common errors.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Test GitLab Duo features</strong></p>\n<p>Try out a few GitLab Duo features to ensure they're working:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the UI, open GitLab Duo Chat and ask it a question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open the web IDE</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new code file and see if Code Suggestions appears.</li>\n<li>Select a code snippet and use the <code>/explain</code> command to receive an explanation from Duo Chat.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Check AI Gateway logs</strong></p>\n<p>Review the AI gateway logs to see the requests coming to the gateway from the selected model:</p>\n<p>In your terminal, run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">docker logs &lt;ai-gateway-container-id&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Optional: In AWS, you can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html\">activate CloudWatch and S3 as log destinations</a>. Doing so would enable you to see all your requests, prompts, and answers in CloudWatch.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Keep in mind that activating these logs in AWS logs user data, which may not comply with privacy rules.</p>\n<p>And here you have full access to using GitLab Duo's AI features across the platform while retaining complete control over the data flow operating within the secure AWS cloud.</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<h3>Selecting the right model for each use case</h3>\n<p>The GitLab team actively tests each model's performance for each feature and provides <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_models_and_hardware_requirements/#supported-models\">tier ranking of model's performance and suitability depending on the functionality:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fully compatible: The model can likely handle the feature without any loss of quality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Largely compatible: The model supports the feature, but there might be compromises or limitations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not compatible: The model is unsuitable for the feature, likely resulting in significant quality loss or performance issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As of this writing, most GitLab Duo features can be configured with Self Hosted. The complete availability overview is available in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/#supported-gitlab-duo-features\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Going beyond AWS Bedrock</h3>\n<p>While this guide focuses on AWS Bedrock integration, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted supports multiple deployment options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_llm_serving_platforms/#vllm\">On-premises with vLLM</a>: Run models locally with vLLM for fully air-gapped environments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/gitlab_duo_self_hosted/supported_llm_serving_platforms/#for-cloud-hosted-model-deployments\">Azure OpenAI Service</a>: Similar to AWS Bedrock, you can use Azure OpenAI for models like GPT-4.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>GitLab Duo Self-Hosted provides a powerful solution for organizations that need AI-powered development tools while maintaining strict control over their data and infrastructure. By following this implementation guide, you can deploy a robust solution that meets security and compliance requirements without compromising on the advanced capabilities that AI brings to your software development lifecycle.</p>\n<p>For organizations with stringent security and compliance needs, GitLab Duo Self-Hosted strikes the perfect balance between innovation and control, allowing you to harness the power of AI while keeping your code and intellectual property secure within your boundaries.</p>\n<p>Would you like to learn more about implementing GitLab Duo Self-Hosted in your environment?

Remember to include human intervention when exploring MCP Server, as a safeguard. Use secure access controls, clear audit trails, and strong error handling to help keep your system reliable. A layer of human oversight helps to ensure that critical decisions aren’t left entirely to automation. As with most new technologies, regular testing, monitoring, and maintenance are ideal best practices to adopt for a successful and resilient setup.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"availability-pricing\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#availability-pricing\">Availability &amp; Pricing</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#availability-pricing\"></a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong>  <a href=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/product-lifecycle/#public-preview\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supported</a> in production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"related-resources\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#related-resources\">Related Resources</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#related-resources\"></a></h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/mcp-digitalocean\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io\" rel=\"ugc nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Model Context Protocol overview</a></li>\n<li>Docs coming soon</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"feedback-next-steps\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#feedback-next-steps\">Feedback &amp; Next Steps</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#feedback-next-steps\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>We’d love to hear what you build with MCP.

This new engine seamlessly replaces our previous offering, Managed Caching (formerly Managed Redis®). For users, the transition is 1:1—Managed Caching for Valkey is a drop-in replacement for our existing Managed Caching service. It’s a fully managed, high-performance, in-memory datastore built for caching, message queues, and even primary database use. Managed Caching for Valkey is Redis®-compatible, supporting full compatibility with Valkey 8.0 and Redis 7.2.4®, making it easy to transfer your existing caching clusters. You can learn more about the database service by reading the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-managed-valkey\">blog</a> or exploring our <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-valkey\">product documentation.</a></p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"introducing-role-based-access-control-to-digitalocean-managed-monogdb-with-predefined-roles-may\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#introducing-role-based-access-control-to-digitalocean-managed-monogdb-with-predefined-roles-may\">Introducing Role-Based Access Control to DigitalOcean Managed MonogDB with Predefined Roles [May]</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#introducing-role-based-access-control-to-digitalocean-managed-monogdb-with-predefined-roles-may\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>May 7 marked the introduction of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB with support for predefined roles. Starting that day, MongoDB users can now assign the following roles to database users: <strong>“readOnly”</strong>, <strong>“readWrite”</strong>, and <strong>“dbAdmin”</strong>. These predefined roles help simplify access management by allowing you to enforce clear, predefined access policies, applicable to actions such as querying data, performing CRUD operations, or managing database settings. Managing team access can be complex, time-consuming, and challenging. However, Role-Based Access Control helps address these issues by enhancing security, improving operational efficiency and compliance, reducing costs, and offering flexible role adaptability.

You can now enable the node pools within your Kubernetes environment to automatically scale down to zero when idle, stopping compute charges during those periods of inactivity. This feature is optimal for development or testing environments, applications with usage patterns tied to business hours that naturally yield idle periods, or workloads that use specialized node pools like GPU or CPU-Optimized for intermittent jobs. The main components of this feature include:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Reduce node pools to zero</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allows you to set the minimum node count (min-nodes) to 0 using the UI, CLI, or API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Seamless integration with your existing autoscaling configurations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintain full control over which node pools are able to scale to zero, giving you more customization and control.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Automatic scaling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Automatically detects pending pods that require scaled-down resources, helping customers to efficiently allocate resources without impacting availability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conversely, when workloads are scheduled that require the node pool, it automatically scales back up. The Cluster Autoscaler automatically detects pending pods that require a scaled-down node pool and provisions the necessary nodes on demand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provisions nodes on-demand when workloads are scheduled, allowing for dynamic infrastructure adjustments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Cost optimization</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Eliminates compute charges for idle node pools, saving you money.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Valuable for development, testing, and specialized workloads where resource demands fluctuate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enables a true pay-per-use infrastructure model within Kubernetes, aligning costs directly with consumption.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you can enable true on-demand infrastructure, and automatically ensure you only pay for compute resources when they’re actually in use, whenever you need them.</p>\n</details>\n<details class=\"collapsible\" open=\"\">\n\n<h2 id=\"digitalocean-kubernetes-now-available-in-our-new-ai-optimized-atlanta-data-center-atl1\"><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#digitalocean-kubernetes-now-available-in-our-new-ai-optimized-atlanta-data-center-atl1\">DigitalOcean Kubernetes now available in our new, AI-optimized Atlanta data center (ATL1)</a><a class=\"hash-anchor\" href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog.atom#digitalocean-kubernetes-now-available-in-our-new-ai-optimized-atlanta-data-center-atl1\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>DigitalOcean’s newest AI-optimized data center, ATL1 in Atlanta-Douglasville, is now fully operational, so you can now deploy fully-managed Kubernetes clusters in the southeast United States.</p>\n<p>As our newest and largest data center, ATL1 it is purpose-built to deliver high-density GPU infrastructure optimized for AI/ML workloads.

      "summary": "<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_-6V9xGQM6vGmsiD_dNEog.png\" /></figure><p>The results of the 2025 Argo CD user survey are in! We had a fantastic response, with 185 submissions, which shows the community is more engaged than ever.</p><p>This year, our goal was to capture a well-rounded view of how folks use Argo CD. We strive to stay closely connected to our users, understand where we’re excelling, and identify current pain points so we can prioritize improvements and proactively address community needs.</p><p>This year’s theme is environment promotion, as it has emerged as one of the most significant pain points currently experienced by Argo CD users.</p><p>Here’s what we learned.</p><h4>TL;DR</h4><p>Argo CD is growing fast and becoming a standard for deployments to production!</p><p>Compared to 2023, significantly more organizations rely on it in production. Over 60% of respondents have been actively using it in Production for more than 2 years. Patterns like ApplicationSets and self-healing have become widely adopted. Argo CD is increasingly being used at scale, with instances managing more applications, often spanning multiple clusters. We can expect scalability and performance to become the pressure points, as well as growing interest in enterprise-like capabilities from the community.</p><p>Environment promotion is where things start to get tricky. Most teams still lean on custom scripts or manual steps to get the job done. Many organizations seek solutions to improve traceability and visibility, and to standardize workflows across environments. We will likely see more maturity and new capabilities in this area.</p><p>We’re also seeing more applications under management overall, with organizations connecting more clusters to each Argo CD instance, yet still running just one to five instances. This trend points to growing pressure on instance scalability and performance.</p><p>A few more highlights from the results:</p><ul><li>Argo Labs projects like Argo CD Image Updater, Argo CD Operator, and Argo CD Vault Plugin are gaining traction, reflecting a push toward automation.</li><li>Helm is by far the most popular Argo CD installation method.</li><li>Platform engineers now make up a larger share of the community, reflecting broader organizational shifts.</li></ul><h4>What do developers really think of Argo CD?</h4><p>We kicked off the survey by asking users how likely they were to recommend Argo CD to others — one of the simplest ways to get a feel for overall satisfaction.</p><p>The 2025 result? Overwhelmingly positive 🎉 Even more users this year said they’d recommend Argo CD compared to an already strong showing in 2023. That shift says a lot about how far the tool has come and the growing trust the community has in it. In fact, Argo CD achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 79 — an increase of 3 points from two years ago — highlighting exceptional user satisfaction!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZY4tGNGXZGrHgLfn\" /></figure><p>We were overwhelmed by the encouraging and positive comments, reflecting just how much people love the project and deeply value the vibrant Argo community. Here’s what some users had to say:</p><blockquote><em>“Argo CD is incredible, I have no idea how we survived without it in the past.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Thanks for this great tool ❤️”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re awesome!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Please keep going!”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Keep up the good work! :)”</em></blockquote><p>We asked which features users find most valuable. The winners?</p><ul><li>ApplicationSets</li><li>Argo CD’s intuitive UI</li></ul><p>Together, they make it much easier to manage and visualise complex deployments.</p><p>Also mentioned: auto-sync, drift detection, rollbacks, RBAC, multi-source support, and integrations.</p><h4>Who’s using Argo CD these days?</h4><p>The community remains consistent and is made up mostly of DevOps and platform engineers, but platform engineers have grown from 25% in 2023 to 37% in 2025. DevOps engineers declined slightly from 43% to 36%. This shift likely reflects the broader industry trend toward adopting a platform mindset, resulting in increased demand for dedicated platform engineering roles. Roles like architects and SREs remained steady.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZXUJ5osL9R28zoUn\" /></figure><h4>What does adoption look like in 2025?</h4><p>With the adoption being consistently high, 93% of respondents use Argo CD in production in 2023 and 97% in 2025, the implementation maturity grows significantly. In 2023, only 28% had used Argo CD in production for over 2 years. In 2025, that number jumped to 60%, and fewer than 10% were still evaluating or in early phases.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e0xsvHzotjrhkIYg\" /></figure><p>Almost 60% of respondents said that 75% or more of their production applications now run on Kubernetes.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gWqJBdpN4BHjbFFs\" /></figure><p>As Kubernetes adoption deepens, Argo CD has become an essential part of the CI/CD infrastructure. As more organizations rely on Argo CD, we’ll likely see continued investment from both the community and vendors, as well as more contributors joining the project.</p><p>When it comes to Argo CD installation, Helm is by far the top choice, followed by tools like Kustomize and Terraform. Interesting to note: 19% use cluster-wide installs versus just 10% using namespace-scoped ones.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*x4RJRiUclqZg-VgN\" /></figure><h4>What does the Argo CD footprint look like?</h4><p>The most noticeable trend is the growing number of applications. Organizations are managing bigger setups with fewer, larger instances.</p><p>In 2023, just over 15% managed more than 500 Applications; by 2025, this rose to 42%. Notably, these numbers don’t correlate with how long organizations have used Argo CD and how many applications they have.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eRwUqAp_3dbairfo\" /></figure><p>The number of Argo CD instances is growing compared to 2023, but the increase is not as significant as the rise in the number of applications. In 2023, 77% of respondents reported having fewer than 6 instances, while this percentage fell to 64% in 2025. Nevertheless, most organizations still use only a handful of instances.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*q_ePbizmF7pE04-k\" /></figure><p>Even though the number of Argo CD instances hasn’t changed much, the number of applications certainly has! This means each instance is likely connecting to more clusters. For example, back in 2023, about 42% of instances were linked to one Kubernetes cluster. Fast forward to 2025, and that number has dropped to 25%. At the same time, the share of instances connecting to more than 20 clusters has jumped significantly, going from 5% to 25%.</p><p>In summary, organizations manage a significantly larger number of applications, with more clusters connected to a single Argo CD instance, typically keeping the number of instances between 1 and 5.</p><p>So, what does this mean for the community and the project? Well, it seems that managing lots of Argo CD instances might not be the biggest hurdle for most teams. Instead, the real pressure points are around scalability and performance as organizations push Argo CD to handle more clusters and Applications. Users are already calling out these challenges, and they’re likely to become even more important moving forward. The good news? Some of this work is already underway.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Interested in how to scale Argo CD? Take a look at the </em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-agent\"><em>argocd-agent project</em></a><em> or read an </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/\"><em>article about scaling up Argo CD</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you want to contribute to measuring and improving Argo scalability, take a look at the Scalability special interest group (</em><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/tree/main/sigs/sig-scalability\"><em>Argo SIG Scalability</em></a><em>).</em></p><h4>What patterns and tools are catching on?</h4><p>More and more teams are following Argo CD’s recommended practices. App-of-Apps, ApplicationSets, and built-in self-healing are now widely used to manage complex GitOps setups.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG5_7BB_xx5xn1U_\" /></figure><p>We also asked about sub-projects, an area that shows the ecosystem dynamics. The most used are:</p><ul><li>Argo CD Image Updater</li><li>Argo CD Operator</li><li>Argo CD Vault Plugin</li></ul><p>Like the patterns mentioned earlier, the popularity of these Argo Labs projects reflects growing efforts to make Argo CD implementations more structured and automation-friendly.</p><p><em>ℹ️ You can manage secrets with </em><a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/secret-management/#secret-management\"><em>Kubernetes operators</em></a><em>, one of the recommended ways of managing secrets on the destination cluster. This keeps Argo CD out of direct secret management, helping avoid accidental updates and reducing the risk of leaks.</em></p><p>Image Updater is the most adopted sub-project (used by 34% of respondents). While still under active development and intended for non-critical environments, its popularity shows just how hungry teams are for better deployment and promotion automation.</p><p>But Image Updater only solves part of the deployment automation puzzle. There’s still no go-to comprehensive solution out there. We’ll explore this further in the next section on environment promotion.</p><h4>Environment promotion</h4><p>Given how widely Argo CD is used in production, we wanted to explore how teams handle environment promotion. Is it a pain point for GitOps users? And how do their approaches compare to the more traditional promotion strategies used on other platforms?</p><p>First, we looked at the number of environments teams work with. Now, most respondents use 3 or fewer. Only 12% reported having more than 8.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lwhiMHHc0r41nELe\" /></figure><p>This introduces complexity, as teams must coordinate across multiple instances. And that’s where challenges like consistent observability start to show up.</p><p>To dig deeper into this, we asked teams about their biggest pain points. What came up most?</p><ul><li>Traceability across environments, what version of a deployed app is running where (51%)</li><li>Release gates (44%)</li><li>Understanding app health and status across environments (37%)</li><li>Keeping pipeline definitions consistent (36%)</li><li>Troubleshooting failed promotions (29%)</li></ul><p>Most teams reported multiple challenges, with traceability and release gates often mentioned together.</p><p>To understand what drives these challenges, we asked how teams promote applications across environments.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IV4zO6ktxeE6AFz0\" /></figure><p>The most common setup is DIY. Around 67% use scripts, in-house tools, or both.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of teams handle promotions solely through manual manifest updates, and almost half use some form of manual step, often paired with scripts.</p><p>So, how can we make sense of this combination? One possibility is that teams are using Argo CD Image Updater, currently the most popular sub-project, for simple, image-only updates. For more complex tasks, like updating configuration files, many might rely on manual steps. In other words, automation helps with the easy stuff, but more involved changes still need hands-on work.</p><p><em>ℹ️ Manual manifest updates are often where teams start with Argo CD. They can work well for small setups, like a few static infrastructure manifests.</em></p><p><em>But as you scale, they tend to fall short. It’s easy to run into slower deployments, more manual overhead, and challenges around security and compliance. If you’re growing with Argo CD, it’s worth moving toward full CI/CD automation to keep things on track.</em></p><p>A few out-of-the-box solutions for automated environment promotion are starting to show up in the survey. The most mentioned, though still only used by 4% of respondents, is <a href=\"https://argo-gitops-promoter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">GitOps Promoter</a>. It’s part of the Argo CD ecosystem and works alongside <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/proposals/manifest-hydrator/\">Hydrator</a> to handle promotions via pull requests. Others mentioned Codefresh GitOps and Kargo.</p><p>Here’s how one person summed it up:</p><blockquote><em>“Some sort of environment promotion. Lots of players in the game now and it’s hard to settle on one. Lots of manual reviews required for manifest changes that can be tiresome to compare against other environments. Some sort of environment comparison tool would be good.”</em></blockquote><p>That quote really captures where things stand. Plenty is happening in this space, but no clear winner or standard approach just yet. As more teams adopt Argo CD and take on more advanced deployment setups, tackling challenges like traceability, testing, and consistent configuration will only become more important.</p><p>This is definitely a space to watch. Expect more tooling, more investment, and, hopefully, comprehensive user-friendly solutions soon.</p><h4>What challenges are teams facing?</h4><p>After digging into environment promotion, we zoomed out and asked about broader challenges, too.</p><p>Nearly 30% of respondents said they had no major challenges with Argo CD, which is a great sign.</p><p>The most common challenge, flagged by 37%, was environment modeling and promotion workflows (covered earlier).</p><p>Other pain points included:</p><ul><li>Troubleshooting deployments and app issues (25%)</li><li>Too much manual work or not enough automation (23%)</li><li>Limited visibility into deployment status (16%)</li></ul><h4>What features are missing?</h4><p>To wrap up, we asked what users think is missing from Argo CD. Many of the responses built on earlier themes.</p><p>Some areas users want to see improved:</p><ul><li>Support for promoting apps through stages and managing service dependencies.</li><li>Better templating in ApplicationSets, progressive syncs, and built-in promotion workflows.</li><li>Multi-cluster visibility and faster UI performance.</li><li>Enterprise-grade features like fine-grained RBAC, audit trails, Vault and Prometheus integrations, and better error messages.</li></ul><p>As teams scale up, these requests point toward a natural next step: evolving Argo CD into a full-featured, enterprise-ready platform.</p><h4>Final words</h4><p>The 2025 survey gave us a ton to think about. We saw just how far Argo CD has come, what’s working well, and what needs more attention. All these insights are gold for the project’s future evolution.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who took the time to share feedback!</p><p>Special shoutout to those who offered to help with case studies, blog posts, talks, or quotes. It really helps grow the community!</p><p>And thanks to Katie Lamkin-Fulsher, Dan Garfield, Henrik Blixt, Michael Crenshaw, Christian Hernandez, Regina Voloshin, Kostis Kapelonis, Jenny Blekh and Tegan Ali, who made this survey possible.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ab045f7d5d9a\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-cd-2025-user-survey-results-ab045f7d5d9a\">Argo CD 2025 User Survey Results</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io\">Argo Project</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

With v3.1, the first batch of features comes out of the gate; featuring <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org/\">OCI</a> support, CLI Plugins, Hydrator updates, UI improvements, plus much more.</p><p>Along with new features, this release comes with a whole slew of security fixes, bug fixes, and general quality of life improvements.</p><p>You can download the v3.1 on the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v3.1.0\">Argo CD Releases Page</a>!</p><p>We are really excited to have you try out the new features and look forward to any feedback from the border community! With that, let’s dive into what this release holds!</p><h3>OCI Support</h3><p>Argo CD has supported obtaining Kubernetes manifests from either a Git repository, a Helm chart repository, and later support for getting manifests from a Helm chart stored within an Open Container Initiative (OCI) registry. As OCI registries have more frequently been used to store content aside from container images, more and more projects have been adding support for using OCI as a storage mechanism and a source of truth.</p><p>Starting with Argo CD v3.1, we now support OCI by enabling the use of OCI-compliant container registries as sources for configuration artifacts. This means Argo CD can pull Kubernetes manifests packaged as OCI artifacts from registries that follow the OCI image and distribution specifications. This enhances security and portability, as it allows users to leverage the same registries they use for container images to also store and distribute deployment configurations. Argo CD OCI support comes into beta with this release.</p><p>BIG thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/blakepettersson\">@blakepettersson</a> from Akuity for leading this effort!</p><h3>Hydrator Improvements</h3><p>Manifest changes are often just image tag bumps. For example, the manifest change associated with a code change. The manifest hydrator writes metadata to the hydrated branch to associate the hydrated commit back to its corresponding dry commit.</p><p>Starting in v3.1, the Hydrator now allows for a way to associate a dry commit with a code commit. This is done by adding information about the upstream repo url, that commit SHA hash, the author of that commit, and any messages associated with that code commit. This information is then added to the Hydrator manifest metadata; this enables future work to be able to display this metadata in the Argo CD UI.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a> from Intuit for this improvement.</p><h3>Server-Side Apply Stabilization</h3><p>Argo CD now supports client-side apply migration, which helps transitioning from client-side apply to server-side apply by moving a resource’s managed fields from one manager to Argo CD’s manager. This feature is particularly useful when you need to migrate existing resources that were created using kubectl client-side apply to server-side apply with Argo CD. You can also specify your own field manager to migrate from using an annotation. This is useful when you have other operators managing resources that are no longer in use and would like Argo CD to own all the fields for that operator.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/pjiang-dev\">@pjiang-dev</a> from Intuit for this contribution.</p><h3>UI Parameterized Action</h3><p>The Argo CD UI in many ways is the first Kubernetes dashboard, providing not only a UI for GitOps users; but also a feature rich UI for Kubernetes end users. In this release, we’ve added the ability to perform additional action on Kubernetes resources, beyond just deleting.</p><p>This feature enables users to scale resources directly from the Argo CD UI. Users will be able to increase or decrease the number of replicas (Pods) for Deployments and StatefulSets by using an input field. The feature aims to enhance user experience, especially for non-technical users, by eliminating the need to modify configuration files or use kubectl commands for scaling.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7C4pCbBqylNOEFKm\" /><figcaption>Scaling resource from Argo CD UI</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ratulbasak\">@ratulbasak</a> from Deutsche Bank for contributing!</p><h3>And We Didn’t Stop There</h3><p>There are other notable updates/improvements in this release.</p><ul><li>Similar to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/\">kubectl plugin mechanism</a>, support for <em>argocd</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20074\">CLI plugins</a> is available in this release. — <a href=\"https://github.com/nitishfy\">@nitishify</a></li><li>You can now <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22482\">explicitly set auto-sync</a> on an Application — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li>The sync option <em>SkipDryRunOnMissingResource</em> was only available as an annotation before; now you can set this as an Application sync option — <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">@pasha-codefresh</a></li><li>Improvements to <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22781\">AppSet Progressive Sync in the UI</a>, paving the path for it to enter Beta — <a href=\"https://github.com/aali309\">@aali309</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/23057\">Add cooldown</a> to prevent resetting autoheal exp backoff preemptively — <a href=\"https://github.com/gdsoumya\">@gdsoumya</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22864\">Added GitHub API metrics</a> to better debug rate limiting — <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">@reggie-k</a></li></ul><h3>Dependency, Platform, and Security Updates</h3><p>Some notable dependency, platform, and security updates included in v3.1</p><p><strong>Go 1.24.4</strong></p><ul><li>All builds, CI, and images now use the latest Go.

This is the first major version change to Argo CD since 2021.</p><p>Argo CD 3.0 brings improvements to security, performance and distills dozens of best practices to provide better defaults while still allowing for flexible configuration to match any team. This release represents a more mature Argo CD that removes deprecated components and streamlines future development and maintenance.</p><p>Let’s jump into what’s new!</p><h4>Better Security with Fine-grained update/delete RBAC enforcement on resources</h4><p>Fine-grained controls introduce the ability to change permissions based not just on the application but on the resources within an application. This new permissions model will require a configuration upgrade from Argo CD 2.x. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/fffinkel\">@fffinkel</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">@agaudreault</a> for this contribution.</p><p>Here’s an example of giving permissions to delete pods within an application.</p><pre>p, example-user, applications, delete/*/Pod/*/*, default/prod-app, allow</pre><h4>Better defaults across the board</h4><p>Every Argo CD admin has changes they like to make when setting up a new installation. Several of these configurations have become best practices or necessities. Some of the new defaults include:</p><ul><li>Use annotations for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/resource_tracking/\">resource tracking</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/22289\">#22289</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/terrytangyuan\">@terrytangyuan</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</li><li>Enable RBAC on pod logging by default just like we do for container exec.

Since then we have noticed a number of emerging anti-patterns and have made the decision to publish recommendations on secrets management. (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/21629\">#21629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">@crenshaw-dev</a>)</p><p>Specifically, we endorse using secrets operators and caution against using config management plugins to inject secrets. We recommend <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.0/operator-manual/secret-management/\">reading the updated documentation on secrets</a>.</p><h4>Upgrading from Argo CD 2.x to Argo CD 3.0</h4><p>Argo CD 3.0 should be a low risk upgrade. We’ve put together a <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/\">full guide to upgrading to Argo CD 3.0</a>. This includes how to identify if a configuration needs to be changed and if applicable how to retain Argo CD 2.x behavior.</p><p>Beyond following the full guide above, all potentially <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3Av3.0\">breaking changes can be found on Github</a>.</p><h4>Ongoing and End of Life Support for Argo CD 2.x</h4><p>Following our documented <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/#release-cycle\">release cadence</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/policy#supported-versions\">security policy</a> we support the last three minor releases for security fixes and critical issues. This means the last version of Argo CD (2.14) will go out of support with the release of 3.2, currently planned for the end of 2025.</p><p>A huge thank you to the more than 94 contributors who helped with this release as well as our release champion <a href=\"https://github.com/reggie-k\">Regina Voloshin</a> as well as the Argo CD lead <a href=\"https://github.com/crenshaw-dev\">Michael Crenshaw</a>.

      "summary": "<p>Welcome Argo Rollouts 1.8! This release had 53 contributors, of which 39 were first-timers, and includes 202 commits! Thank you all for your contributions! There are some really nice features in this release so let’s take a look.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*anQTvyi32Mpo6dIWszWrDg.png\" /></figure><h3>Canary Step Plugins</h3><p>This exciting new feature allows you to configure new steps in your Canary configured Rollout. With this plugin system, you are now able to <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/canary/plugins/\">create a plugin and execute your own steps</a> during the canary analysis. This extends Argo Rollouts capabilities and enriches the progressive delivery experience to accommodate a multitude of scenarios. It is a continuation of the previous work that was done to create a pluggable system for traffic routers and metric providers in the v1.5 release.</p><p>You can refer to the <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/\">documentation</a> to learn more about creating a plugin. Once implemented, it can be configure in the argo-rollouts-config ConfigMap:</p><pre>apiVersion: v1<br />kind: ConfigMap<br />metadata:<br />  name: argo-rollouts-config<br />data:<br />  stepPlugins: |-<br />    - name: &quot;argoproj-labs/step-exec&quot; # name of the plugin<br />      location: &quot;file://./my-custom-plugin&quot; # supports http(s):// urls and file://Ya</pre><p>Users can then configure this plugin as part of their canary steps:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: Rollout<br />metadata:<br />  name: example-plugin-ro<br />spec:<br />  strategy:<br />    canary:<br />      steps:<br />        - plugin:<br />            name: argoproj-labs/step-exec<br />            config:<br />              command: echo &quot;hello world&quot;</pre><p>While these plugins do not require to be open-source, we are looking forward to what the community will implement in the upcoming months. If you are interested in contributing a canary step plugin to the community, simply open an issue under argo-rollouts requesting an argoproj-labs repository to host your plugin.</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/agaudreault\">Alexandre Gaudreault</a></p><h3>Analysis Consecutive Success Limit</h3><p>This provides the <em>inverse</em> of what an analysis currently does. The main use case for this is to allow users to wait on a condition (in a step analysis especially) to hold, before proceeding to the next step.</p><p>Here is an example analysis:</p><pre>apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1<br />kind: AnalysisTemplate<br />metadata:<br />  name: success-rate<br />spec:<br />  args:<br />  - name: service-name<br />  metrics:<br />  - name: success-rate<br />    interval: 1m<br />    successCondition: result[0] &lt;= 0.95<br />    consecutiveSuccessLimit: 3<br />    provider:<br />      prometheus:<br />        address: http://prometheus.example.com:9090<br />        query: |<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;,response_code!~&quot;5.*&quot;}[1m]<br />          )) /<br />          sum(irate(<br />            istio_requests_total{reporter=&quot;source&quot;,destination_service=~&quot;{{args.service-name}}&quot;}[1m]<br />          ))</pre><p>You can find more information in the documentation found <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/analysis/#consecutivesuccesslimit-and-failurelimit\">here</a> .</p><p>Contributed by: <a href=\"https://github.com/y-rabie\">Youssef Rabie</a></p><h3>Other Features</h3><ul><li>New Prometheus metric: build_info (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3591\">#3591</a>)</li><li>Enable pprof profiling support (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3769\">#3769</a>)</li><li>Allow specifying full annotations for Nginx canary (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3671\">#3671</a>)</li><li>Credentials to download plugin (<a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/issues/3905\">#3905</a>)</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><p>We had 36 labeled bug fixes in this release some of the area’s of focus for bugs have been around Rollouts getting stuck progressing and better verification of not causing any outage during a rollout. So, if you have experienced any of these issue test this release out and let us know how it behaves.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>This releases big feature was around step plugins, I can’t wait to see what this feature empowers end users to create. Feel free to share in the CNCF Argo Rollouts Slack channel and open an issue if you would like a plugin repo on argoproj-labs.

      "summary": "<h3>New Release for Argo CD Image Updater — 0.15</h3><p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Argo CD Image Updater, the companion controller to Argo CD for automatically updating container images in Argo CD applications. Read on for more details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tjl-5vVWKCnW3DIcfiyZHg.jpeg\" /></figure><p>Argo CD Image Updater is a project <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">available at Argo Labs</a>. You can use it to automatically monitor your container registries and instruct your applications to perform a redeployment when a new version of a container is available. This means that you can gain the benefits of continuous delivery without the need of custom pipelines for updating your Kubernetes manifest.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">release</a> includes 6 new features, 16 fixes and several documentation updates.</p><p>Here are some highlights:</p><h3>Support of other namespaces apart from “argocd”</h3><p>Traditionally all Argo CD application manifests are deployed in the “argocd” namespace. In recent versions of Argo CD you can now use any namespace for your applications (argocd is still the default).</p><p>There is now support for making Argo CD Image Updater work with Argo CD applications that are not on the argocd namespace.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sribiere-jellysmack\">S Ribiere</a> (Jellysmack) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/763\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Preserve field order when updating Kustomize files</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater has built-in support for Kustomize applications. If the <a href=\"https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics/update-methods/#git-write-back-method\">Git write back method</a> is used, Argo CD Image Updater can also update the container image in the kustomization YAML file of the application.</p><p>Unfortunately the field order was not preserved. This means that running “git diff” (or using Argo CD) would show inconsistent changes that were not related to the image update.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater will preserve the existing field order before and after the update in a predictable manner making automation with other tools much easier.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/jtdoepke\">Jaye Doepke</a> (Mintel) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/666\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating multiple images when using Helm value files</h3><p>Apart from Kustomize, Argo CD Image Updater can also monitor Helm charts and automatically update container tags mentioned in Helm value files.</p><p>In the most typical case a single Helm application will contain a single container image reference. Argo CD Image Updater will correctly detect the new version of the image and update it on the value files.</p><p>Sometimes however a single Helm application will contain multiple container tags. In this case Argo CD Image Updater would detect changes in all images but only update one of them. This process was now updated and now Argo CD Image Updater will work correctly with multi-image applications with the expected behavior.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ljupchokotev\">Lyupcho Kotev</a> (Codira AB) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/790\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Updating Argo CD applications when auto-sync is disabled</h3><p>The main benefit of Argo CD Image Updater is fully automating all application deployments. A new container image is published in the registry, Argo CD Image Updater detects it and writes back to Git, Argo CD takes over and syncs all changes.</p><p>Some organizations however do not employ the auto-sync behavior of Argo CD. This can happen in several cases when deployments must happen manually (usually in production environments). In those scenarios Argo CD Image Updater would not “see” the updated image in the live application (as it was never deployed by Argo CD). This makes Argo CD Image Updater fall in a constant loop where it tries to update the same image again and again, but Argo CD does not deploy anything since auto-sync is disabled.</p><p>This behavior has now changed and Argo CD Image Updater will work even for Argo CD applications where auto-sync is disabled. Argo CD Image Updater will update the image only once as expected and then skip any further changes even if they are not yet on the live application definition.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Fs02\">Surya Asriadie</a> (Smart News) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/607\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Support for Argo CD multi-source application sets</h3><p>Argo CD Image Updater recently gained support for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/\">multi-source applications</a>. The basic functionality worked great for individual applications, but in the case of <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-set/\">Application Sets</a> Argo CD Image Updater could not locate the type of each application (chart/kustomize/manifest) from the resource specification.</p><p>Now Argo CD Image Updater detects the type of each application from the status field of the resource, allowing you to automatically update images even if you employ Application Sets in your organization.</p><p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Sovietaced\">Jason Parraga</a> (Stack AV) for implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/pull/772\">this feature</a>.</p><h3>Improved release process and unit testing</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://blog.argoproj.io/new-release-for-argo-image-updater-0-13-1fa3ef11996f\">promised in the previous release</a>, there were several other internal changes in the project in areas of integration testing and better contributor experience. Even though these changes do not correspond to use-visible features, they are crucial for helping newcomers to the project and accepting new features. We are always looking for ways to attract contributors and making the developer experience an easy process is always a constant goal for us.</p><p>Multiple people were involved in this effort. See all changes <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-image-updater/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">in the release notes</a>.</p><h3>Where to report issues with the release</h3><p>If you would like to contribute new features to Argo CD Image Updater, please submit a pull request as usual.</p><p>If you find any issues with the release please find us on the #argo-cd-image-updater channel in the <a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CHY2THYUU\">CNCF Slack instance</a>.

As always, we appreciate your feedback on any bugs or issues you encounter.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into the details.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9ANBGyCAjfUW5J_v6cm8SA.png\" /></figure><h4><strong>Global Sync Timeout for Applications</strong></h4><p>The global sync timeout feature addresses issues where the sync process gets stuck indefinitely, often due to resources failing to start properly and continuously retrying. Now, a global timeout can be configured on the Argo CD Controller to timeout long-running sync operations thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/andrii-korotkov-verkada\">Andrii Korotkov</a> (Verkada)!</p><p>You can configure the timeout by updating controller.sync.timeout.seconds in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a>.</p><h4><strong>Upgrading Helm to 3.16.2 and adding skipSchemaValidation Flag</strong></h4><p>Helm 3.16 exposes the--skip-schema-validation flag for the helm template command which is now available via the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/helm/#helm-skip-schema-validation\">argocd cli and Application spec.</a> --skip-schema-validation allows users to bypass schema validation—a crucial feature for offline clusters where external schemas are inaccessible. Additionally, Istio 1.24 requires Helm 3.16 or higher.</p><p>Contributed by dmosesson!</p><h4>Application Resource Deletion Protection</h4><p>New <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/user-guide/sync-options/#resource-pruning-with-confirmation\">sync options</a> are now available to help prevent accidental resource deletion. This functionality is particularly useful when Argo CD is used to manage critical resources such as namespaces, volumes, or ingresses in a production environment. Accidental deletion of such resources can lead to data loss or service downtime, necessitating human approval. To enable this functionality, apply the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=confirm annotation to the desired Kubernetes resource. Once the annotation is in place, Argo CD will require manual approval before pruning the resource during application synchronization. Similarly, the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Delete=confirm annotation alters the application deletion process. When this annotation is applied, Argo CD will prompt for confirmation before performing a cascading deletion of the application.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a> (Akuity)!</p><h4><strong>Disable Server Side Apply on individual resources</strong></h4><p>Argo CD introduced server-side apply in v2.10, enhancing how resource changes are managed by leveraging Kubernetes’ native capabilities for conflict resolution and declarative updates. Now, it supports disabling server-side apply at the individual resource level, providing greater flexibility and control over specific resource configurations. Added by <a href=\"https://github.com/pasha-codefresh\">Pasha Kostohrys</a> (Codefresh)!</p><h4><strong>Disable writing K8s Events</strong></h4><p>In environments with many applications or high application churn, Argo CD can cause load on the Kubernetes API server and etcd with the number of events it produces. Operators can now disable the writing of Kubernetes events or tune the ones Argo CD produces.</p><p>Introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/Jack-R-lantern\">Jack-R-lantern</a>!</p><h4>Faster Application Refreshes</h4><p>When Argo CD manages a cluster with many resources, like tens of thousands of pods and replicasets, it is slow to process changes across the resources. The Argo CD UI becomes particularly slow.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mpelekh\">Mykola Pelekh</a>, you can now configure batches that reduce lock contention and increase the refresh speed! Both controller.cluster.cache.batch.events.processing and controller.cluster.cache.events.processing.interval can be configured in the <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.14/operator-manual/argocd-cmd-params-cm-yaml/\">argocd-cmd-params-cm configmap</a> to enable and tune the feature</p><h3>Other Notable Changes</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/19963\">Display SHA’s revision in history</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/Tchoupinax\">Tchoupinax</a></p><p>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/18703\">cache layer</a> for Argo Projects — <a href=\"https://github.com/dacofr\">Daco</a></p><p>Globally <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20064\">parameterize</a> requeue time for applicationsets — <a href=\"https://github.com/rumstead\">rumstead</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20275\">Exponential backoff</a> for self heal — <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmt\">Alexander Matyushentsev</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20462\">Add ignore-healthcheck </a>annotation — <a href=\"https://github.com/CefBoud\">ABBOUD Moncef</a></p><p>Support Istio <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20273\">ServiceEntry</a> network node — <a href=\"https://github.com/zapkub\">Rungsikorn Rungsikavarnich</a></p><p>Enable <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/20299\">word wrap in the manifest panel</a> — <a href=\"https://github.com/linghaoSu\">Linghao Su</a></p><h3>Where Can I Get the New Release?</h3><p>For more details and installation instructions, check the <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.14.0-rc2\">release notes</a>, and stay tuned for <a href=\"https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/\">upgrade instructions</a>.

href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a> is an official Kubernetes project designed to optimize the self-hosting of Generative AI models on Kubernetes. It provides a standardized, vendor-neutral approach to intelligent AI traffic management.</p>\n<p>Istio 1.27 includes a <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/gateways/#istio\">fully-compliant implementation</a> of the extension when using the Gateway API for cluster ingress traffic control.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://istio.io/blog/2025/inference-extension-support/\">Learn more about the extension and Istio&rsquo;s implementation</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ambient-multicluster\">Ambient Multicluster</h3>\n<p>Support for multi-cluster deployments in ambient mode is now available in Alpha. This enables multiple ambient mode clusters to be connected into the same mesh, expanding the scope of no-sidecar networking to larger and more distributed environments.</p>\n<p>In this initial release, testing has been focused on multi-network, multi-primary topologies, where each cluster runs its own control plane. Support for more complex topologies will follow as the baseline feature matures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crl-support-for-plugged-in-cas\">CRL Support for Plugged-in CAs</h3>\n<p>Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support is now available for users who have &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; their own certificate authority, rather than using the default provided by Istio.  This allows proxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of mesh deployments using plugged-in CAs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"listenersets-support\">ListenerSets Support</h3>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1713\">ListenerSets</a> API allows you to define a reusable set of listeners that can be attached to a <code>Gateway</code> resource. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication when managing multiple Gateways that share common listener configurations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"native-nftables-support-in-sidecar-mode\">Native nftables Support in Sidecar Mode</h3>\n<p>Istio now supports the <a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/47821\">native nftables</a> backend in Sidecar mode. nftables is the modern successor to iptables, providing better performance, improved maintainability, and more flexible rule management for transparent traffic redirection to and from the Envoy sidecar proxy.</p>\n<p>Many major Linux distributions are adopting nftables as the default packet filtering framework, and Istio’s native support ensures compatibility with this shift.</p>\n<p>Support for nftables in ambient mode is actively being developed and will arrive in a future release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-127\">Upgrading to 1.27</h2>\n<p>We would like to hear from you regarding your experience upgrading to Istio 1.27. You can provide feedback in the <code>#release-1.27</code> channel in our <a href=\"https://slack.istio.io/\">Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n<p>Would you like to contribute directly to Istio?

      "summary": "<h2 id=\"traffic-management\">Traffic Management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated</strong> traffic distribution to disregard subzone when the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field is set to <code>PreferClose</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for multiple server certificates in gateway (istio &amp; Gateway API). (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/36181\">Issue #36181</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> alpha support for specifying <code>ServiceScope</code> in the MeshConfig in ambient multicluster configurations.\n<code>ServiceScope</code> enables the selection of individual services or services in a namespace to be global or local.\nA locally scoped service is only discoverable by the data plane in the same cluster as the service. A local\nservice is not discoverable by the data planes in other clusters. A globally-scoped service is discoverable\nby the data planes in all clusters. Defining selectors for the <code>serviceScopeConfigs</code> determines which services\nand workloads are shared with the data plane and which clusters and listeners are configured for the waypoints\n(including e/w gateways) in the mesh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature flag <code>EnableGatewayAPICopyLabelsAnnotations</code> to allow\nusers to choose whether the deployment resources will inherit attributes from\nthe parent Gateway API resource. This feature is enabled by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>PreferSameNode</code> and <code>PreferSameZone</code> on the Kubernetes Service <code>trafficDistribution</code> field.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55848\">Issue #55848</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> Pilot environment variables <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV4_PREFIX</code> and <code>PILOT_IP_AUTOALLOCATE_IPV6_PREFIX</code> to configure the IP CIDR prefix(es) for auto-allocated IPs. This allows users to set a specific range of IPs for auto-allocation, providing more control over the IP address space used for VIPs by the ipallocate controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> logging of a secret&rsquo;s namespace and name when a certificate is invalid.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56651\">Issue #56651</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">Gateway API Inference Extension</a>.\nThis feature is off by default and can be turned on with the <code>SUPPORT_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION</code> environment variable.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55768\">Issue #55768</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for merge operations when applying to <code>LISTENER_FILTER</code> in EnvoyFilter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> that allows to enable lazy initialization of sidecar resources,\nOnly computing internal indexes when <code>SidecarScopes</code> are actually used by a Proxy. This feature supersedes the\nprevious <code>PILOT_CONVERT_SIDECAR_SCOPE_CONCURRENCY</code> which would allow concurrent conversion with specific given concurrency,\ninstead <code>ENABLE_LAZY_SIDECAR_EVALUATION</code> will use the same concurrency as <code>PILOT_PUSH_THROTTLE</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for native <code>nftables</code> when using Istio sidecar mode. This update makes it possible to use <code>nftables</code>\ninstead of iptables to manage network rules, offering more efficient approach to traffic redirection for pods and\nservices. To enable the <code>nftables</code> mode, use <code>--set values.global.nativeNftables=true</code> at the time of installation.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56487\">Issue #56487</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for specifying traffic distribution mode for services. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/53354\">Issue #53354</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> feature <code>ENABLE_PROXY_FIND_POD_BY_IP</code> that allows enabling association of Pods to Proxies by IP address, if the association by name and namespace fails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support of retry budget in <code>DestinationRule</code> resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the gateway status controller leader election was not running per revision, which could lead to issues in multi-revision setups.\nThe leader election is now correctly scoped to each revision, ensuring that the gateway status controller operates independently for each revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55717\">Issue #55717</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where virtual service routes were ignored when the virtual service was configured with hosts containing mixed-case letters.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/55767\">Issue #55767</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a regression in Istio 1.26.0 that caused a panic in istiod when processing Gateway API hostnames.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56300\">Issue #56300</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where mTLS was disabled unexpectedly when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> or <code>PILOT_ENDPOINT_TELEMETRY_LABEL</code> was set to <code>false</code>\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56352\">Issue #56352</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where ambient host network iptables rules were being skipped due to higher-priority CNI rules in some deployments.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56414\">Issue #56414</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>EnvoyFilter</code> with <code>targetRefs</code> matched incorrect resources.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56417\">Issue #56417</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> ambient index to filter configurations by their revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477\">Issue #56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label was not properly skipped on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> were in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI plugin incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod, which had been deleted, to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurred, ztunnel would not be able to become ready.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56738\">Issue #56738</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio&rsquo;s outbound route configuration did not include the absolute domain name  (fully-qualified domain name with trailing dot) in the domains list for <code>VirtualHost</code> entries. This change ensures that requests using absolute domain names (ending with a dot, e.g., <code>my-service.my-ns.svc.cluster.local.</code>) are properly routed to the intended service instead of falling back to <code>PassthroughCluster</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56007\">Issue #56007</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for omitting the issuer claim in JWT tokens. Either the issuer claim or a <code>JWKSUri</code> is required,\nbut not both. This allows for more flexible configurations when using JWT tokens for authentication, particularly\nin scenarios where the issuer claim may be dynamic. (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/14400\">Issue #14400</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> an opt-in feature when using istio-cni in ambient mode, to create an Istio-owned CNI config\nfile which contains the contents of the primary CNI config file and the Istio CNI plugin. This\nopt-in feature is a solution to the issue of traffic bypassing the mesh on node restart when the\nIstio CNI <code>DaemonSet</code> is not ready, the Istio CNI plugin is not installed, or the plugin is not\ninvoked to configure traffic redirection from pods their node ztunnels. This feature is enabled by\nsetting <code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfig</code> to true in the istio-cni Helm chart values. If no value is set for\n<code>cni.istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code>, the Istio-owned CNI config file will be named <code>02-istio-cni.conflist</code>.\nThe <code>istioOwnedCNIConfigFilename</code> value must have a higher lexicographical priority than the primary CNI.\nAmbient and chained CNI plugins must be enabled for this feature to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> validation for the istioctl <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument. It should not have more than one alias per cluster.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> by migrating from <code>certificates.k8s.io/v1alpha1</code> to the stable <code>v1beta1</code> API in Kubernetes 1.33+. This improves compatibility and future-proofs Istio’s certificate distribution mechanism.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56306\">Issue #56306</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> support for external Secret Discovery Service (SDS) providers in the Gateway TLS configuration. Istio now provides\nimproved integration with external SDS providers for TLS certificate management at the Gateway.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56522\">Issue #56522</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> certificate revocation list (CRL) support for plugged-in CAs, enabling Istio to watch for <code>ca-crl.pem</code> files and\nautomatically distribute CRLs across all namespaces in the cluster. This enhancement allows\nproxies to validate and reject revoked certificates, strengthening the security posture of service mesh deployments\nusing plugged-in CAs.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56529\">Issue #56529</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Added</strong> the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) option to <code>COMPLIANCE_POLICY</code>.\nThis policy enforces TLS <code>v1.3</code>, cipher suites <code>TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> and <code>TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code>,\nand post-quantum-safe key exchange <code>X25519MLKEM768</code>.\nTo enable this compliance policy in ambient mode, it must be set in the pilot and ztunnel containers.\nThis policy applies to the following data paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mTLS communication between Envoy proxies and ztunnels;</li>\n<li>regular TLS on the downstream and the upstream of Envoy proxies (e.g. gateway);</li>\n<li>Istio xDS server.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56330\">Issue #56330</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where sidecars with the old <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> setting were not able to connect to istiod with the new <code>CLUSTER_ID</code> settings when <code>--clusterAliases</code> command argument was being used.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56022\">Issue #56022</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue in the <code>pluginca</code> feature where <code>istiod</code> would silently fallback to the self-signed CA if the provided <code>cacerts</code> bundle was incomplete.\nThe system now properly validates the presence of all required CA files and fails with an error if the bundle is incomplete.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\">Telemetry</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Grafana dashboard was linking to the Istio Mesh Dashboard using path-based links that no longer work.

iptables binary detection logic has been improved to verify a degree of baseline kernel support exists, and prefer <code>nft</code> in a <code>tie</code> situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue causing false positives with <code>istioctl analyze</code> raising IST0134 even when <code>PILOT_ENABLE_IP_AUTOALLOCATE</code> was set to <code>true</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56083\">Issue #56083</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> a panic in <code>istioctl manifest translate</code> when the IstioOperator config contained multiple gateways.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56223\">Issue #56223</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> ambient index to filter configs by revision.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56477\">Issue #56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> incorrect UID and GID assignment for <code>istio-proxy</code> and <code>istio-validation</code> containers on OpenShift when TPROXY mode was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> logic to properly ignore the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> are in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.

#56477</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the <code>topology.istio.io/network</code> label was not properly skipped on the system namespace when <code>discoverySelectors</code> were in use.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56687\">Issue #56687</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where the CNI plugin incorrectly handled pod deletion when the pod was not yet marked as enrolled in the mesh. In some cases, this could cause a pod, which had been deleted, to be included in the ZDS snapshot and never cleaned up. If this occurred, ztunnel would not be able to become ready.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56738\">Issue #56738</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where access logs were not updated when the referenced service was created later than the Telemetry resource.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825\">Issue #56825</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where <code>ClusterTrustBundle</code> was not configured properly when <code>ENABLE_CLUSTER_TRUST_BUNDLE_API</code> was enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where Istio access logs were never sent to the OTLP endpoint.  (<a href=\"https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/56825\">Issue 56825</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fixed</strong> an issue where high CPU usage could occur if an item was actively being worked on by a different worker until that worker was done with that item.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

There's also a blog post from <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2024/11/19/yace-moves-to-prometheus-community/\">Cristian Greco's point of view</a>.</p>\n<h2>The early days</h2>\n<p>When I first started YACE, I had no idea it would grow to this scale. At the time, I was working with <a href=\"https://www.ivx.com\">Invision AG</a> (not to be confused with the design app), a company focused on workforce management software. They fully supported me in open-sourcing the tool, and with the help of my teammate <a href=\"https://github.com/kforsthoevel\">Kai Forsthövel</a>, YACE was brought to life.</p>\n<p>Our first commit was back in 2018, with one of our primary goals being to make CloudWatch metrics easy to scale and automatically detect what to measure, all while keeping the user experience simple and intuitive. InVision AG was scaling their infrastructure up and down due to machine learning workloads and we needed something that detects new infrastructure easily. This focus on simplicity has remained a core priority. From that point on, YACE began to find its audience.</p>\n<h2>Yace Gains Momentum</h2>\n<p>As YACE expanded, so did the support around it. One pivotal moment was when <a href=\"https://github.com/cristiangreco\">Cristian Greco</a> from Grafana Labs reached out. I was feeling overwhelmed and hardly keeping up when Cristian stepped in, simply asking where he could help. He quickly became the main releaser and led Grafana Labs' contributions to YACE, a turning point that made a huge impact on the project. Along with an incredible community of contributors from all over the world, they elevated YACE beyond what I could have achieved alone, shaping it into a truly global tool. YACE is no longer just my project or Invision's—it belongs to the community.</p>\n<h2>Gratitude and Future Vision</h2>\n<p>I am immensely grateful to every developer, tester, and user who has contributed to YACE's success. This journey has shown me the power of community and open source collaboration. But we're not done yet.</p>\n<p>It's time to take Yace even further—into the heart of the Prometheus ecosystem. Making Yace as the official Amazon CloudWatch exporter for Prometheus will make it easier and more accessible for everyone. With ongoing support from Grafana Labs and my commitment to refining the user experience, we'll ensure YACE becomes an intuitive tool that anyone can use effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>Try out YACE on your own</h2>\n<p>Try out <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter\">YACE (Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter)</a></strong> by following our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/blob/master/docs/installation.md\">Installation Guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can explore various configuration examples <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-community/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/tree/master/examples\">here</a> to get started with monitoring specific AWS services.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable easy auto-discovery across all AWS services, making it simple to monitor any dynamic infrastructure.</p>",

Prometheus has come a long way in that time,\nevolving from a project for early adopters to becoming a standard part of the cloud native monitoring stack. Prometheus 3.0 aims to\ncontinue that journey by adding some exciting new features while largely maintaining stability and compatibility with previous versions.</p>\n<p>The full 3.0 release adds some new features on top of the beta and also introduces a few additional breaking changes that we will describe in this article.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the exciting changes that have been released as part of the beta version, as well as what has been added since:</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand-new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view,\nand will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.</p>\n<p>Since the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the beta, the user interface has been updated to support UTF-8 metric and label names.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UTF-8 UI\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/utf8_ui.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars,\ncreated timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing.\nThere is better handling for partial writes to provide more details to clients when this occurs. More details can be found\n<a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>UTF-8 Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus now allows all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names by default, as well as label values,\nas has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8,\nmetric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax\nin order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Currently only the Go client library has been updated to support UTF-8, but support for other languages will be added soon.</p>\n<h3>OTLP Support</h3>\n<p>In alignment with <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2024/03/14/commitment-to-opentelemetry/\">our commitment to OpenTelemetry</a>, Prometheus 3.0 features\nseveral new features to improve interoperability with OpenTelemetry.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the <code>/api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p>See our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry\">guide</a> on best practices for consuming OTLP metric traffic into Prometheus.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8 Normalization</h4>\n<p>With Prometheus 3.0, thanks to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/feed.xml#utf-8-support\">UTF-8 support</a>, users can store and query OpenTelemetry metrics without annoying changes to metric and label names like <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/translator/prometheus\">changing dots to underscores</a>.</p>\n<p>Notably this allows <strong>less confusion</strong> for users and tooling in terms of the discrepancy between what’s defined in OpenTelemetry semantic convention or SDK and what’s actually queryable.</p>\n<p>To achieve this for OTLP ingestion, Prometheus 3.0 has experimental support for different translation strategies. See <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#:~:text=Settings%20related%20to%20the%20OTLP%20receiver%20feature\">otlp section in the Prometheus configuration</a> for details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: While “NoUTF8EscapingWithSuffixes” strategy allows special characters, it still adds required suffixes for the best experience. See <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/proposals/pull/39\">the proposal on the future work to enable no suffixes</a> in Prometheus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>. Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus community strives to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/stability/\">not break existing features within a major release</a>. With a new major release we took the opportunity to clean up a few, but small, long-standing issues. In other words, Prometheus 3.0 contains a few breaking changes. This includes changes to feature flags, configuration files, PromQL, and scrape protocols.</p>\n<p>Please read the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/3.0/migration/\">migration guide</a> to find out if your setup is affected and what actions to take.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>It’s impressive to see what we have accomplished in the community since Prometheus 2.0. We all love numbers, so let’s celebrate the efficiency improvements we made for both CPU and memory use for the TSDB mode. Below you can see performance numbers between 3 Prometheus versions on the node with 8 CPU and 49 GB allocatable memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.0.0 (7 years ago)</li>\n<li>2.18.0 (4 years ago)</li>\n<li>3.0.0 (now)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Memory bytes\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/memory_bytes_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"CPU seconds\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-11-14/cpu_seconds_ui.png\" /></p>\n<p>It’s furthermore impressive that those numbers were taken using our <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15366\">prombench macrobenchmark</a>\nthat uses the same PromQL queries, configuration and environment–highlighting backward compatibility and stability for the core features, even with 3.0.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>There are still tons of exciting features and improvements we can make in Prometheus and the ecosystem. Here is a non-exhaustive list to get you excited and…\nhopefully motivate you to contribute and join us!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, more inclusive <strong>governance</strong></li>\n<li>More <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> compatibility and features</li>\n<li>OpenMetrics 2.0, now under Prometheus governance!</li>\n<li>Native Histograms stability (and with custom buckets!)</li>\n<li>More optimizations!</li>\n<li>UTF-8 support coverage in more SDKs and tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Try It Out!</h2>\n<p>You can try out Prometheus 3.0 by downloading it from our <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus\">official binaries</a> and <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">container images</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from Prometheus 2.x, check out the migration guide for more information on any adjustments you will have to make.\nPlease note that we strongly recommend upgrading to v2.55 before upgrading to v3.0. Rollback is possible from v3.0 to v2.55, but not to earlier versions.</p>\n<p>As always, we welcome feedback and contributions from the community!</p>",

The Prometheus team worked hard to ensure backwards-compatibility and not to break existing installations, so all of the new features described below build on top of existing functionality. Most users should be able to try Prometheus 3.0 out of the box without any configuration changes.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>With over 7500 commits in the 7 years since Prometheus 2.0 came out there are too many new individual features and fixes to list, but there are some big shiny and breaking changes we wanted to call out. We need everyone in the community to try them out and report any issues you might find.\nThe more feedback we get, the more stable the final 3.0 release can be.</p>\n<h3>New UI</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights in Prometheus 3.0 is its brand new UI that is enabled by default:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New UI query page\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2024-09-11/blog_post_screenshot_tree_view-s.png\" /></p>\n<p>The UI has been completely rewritten with less clutter, a more modern look and feel, new features like a <a href=\"https://promlens.com/\"><strong>PromLens</strong></a>-style tree view, and will make future maintenance easier by using a more modern technical stack.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the new UI in general in <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2024/09/11/a-look-at-the-new-prometheus-3-0-ui/\">Julius' detailed article on the PromLabs blog</a>.\nUsers can temporarily enable the old UI by using the <code>old-ui</code> feature flag.\nSince the new UI is not battle-tested yet, it is also very possible that there are still bugs. If you find any, please <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/new?assignees=&#x26;labels=&#x26;projects=&#x26;template=bug_report.yml\">report them on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Remote Write 2.0</h3>\n<p>Remote-Write 2.0 iterates on the previous protocol version by adding native support for a host of new elements including metadata, exemplars, created timestamp and native histograms. It also uses string interning to reduce payload size and CPU usage when compressing and decompressing. More details can be found <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/specs/remote_write_spec_2_0/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>OpenTelemetry Support</h3>\n<p>Prometheus intends to be the default choice for storing OpenTelemetry metrics, and 3.0 includes some big new features that makes it even better as a storage backend for OpenTelemetry metrics data.</p>\n<h4>UTF-8</h4>\n<p>By default, Prometheus will allow all valid UTF-8 characters to be used in metric and label names, as well as label values as has been true in version 2.x.</p>\n<p>Users will need to make sure their metrics producers are configured to pass UTF-8 names, and if either side does not support UTF-8, metric names will be escaped using the traditional underscore-replacement method. PromQL queries can be written with the new quoting syntax in order to retrieve UTF-8 metrics, or users can specify the <code>__name__</code>  label name manually.</p>\n<p>Not all language bindings have been updated with support for UTF-8 but the primary Go libraries have been.</p>\n<h4>OTLP Ingestion</h4>\n<p>Prometheus can be configured as a native receiver for the OTLP Metrics protocol, receiving OTLP metrics on the /api/v1/otlp/v1/metrics endpoint.</p>\n<h3>Native Histograms</h3>\n<p>Native histograms are a Prometheus metric type that offer a higher efficiency and lower cost alternative to Classic Histograms. Rather than having to choose (and potentially have to update) bucket boundaries based on the data set, native histograms have pre-set bucket boundaries based on exponential growth.</p>\n<p>Native Histograms are still experimental and not yet enabled by default, and can be turned on by passing <code>--enable-feature=native-histograms</code>.  Some aspects of Native Histograms, like the text format and accessor functions / operators are still under active design.</p>\n<h3>Other Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>The following feature flags have been removed, being enabled by default instead. References to these flags should be removed from configs, and will be ignored in Prometheus starting with version 3.0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>promql-at-modifier</code></li>\n<li><code>promql-negative-offset</code></li>\n<li><code>remote-write-receiver</code></li>\n<li><code>no-scrape-default-port</code></li>\n<li><code>new-service-discovery-manager</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Range selections are now <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13213\">left-open and right-closed</a>, which will avoid rare occasions that more points than intended are included in operations.</p>\n<p>Agent mode is now stable and has its own config flag instead of a feature flag</p>",

      "summary": "<p><em>The <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/\">OpenTelemetry project</a> is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It is gaining widespread adoption due to its consistent specification between signals and promise to reduce vendor lock-in which is something that we’re excited about.</em></p>\n<h2>Looking back at 2023</h2>\n<p>Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the OpenTelemetry community to make sure that OpenTelemetry and Prometheus support each other bidirectionally. This led to the drafting of the official specification to convert between the two systems, as well as the implementations that allow you to ingest Prometheus metrics into OpenTelemetry Collector and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have spent a significant amount of time understanding the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epvoO_R7JhmHYsII-GJ6Yw99Ky91dKOqOtZGqX7Bk0g/edit?usp=sharing\">challenges faced by OpenTelemetry users</a> when storing their metrics in Prometheus and based on those, explored <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGdKqcmDExynRXgC_u1CDtotz9IUdMrq2yyIq95hl70/edit?usp=sharing\">how we can address them</a>. Some of the changes proposed need careful considerations to avoid breaking either side's operating promises, e.g. supporting both push and pull. At PromCon Berlin 2023, we attempted to summarize our ideas in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcabOH70FqU\">one of the talks</a>.</p>\n<p>At our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.9kp854ea3sv4\">dev summit in Berlin</a>, we spent the majority of our time discussing these changes and our general stance on OpenTelemetry in depth, and the broad consensus is that we want <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LC3wJcVk00l8w5P3oLQ-m3Y37iom6INAMEu2ZAGIIE/edit#bookmark=id.196i9ij1u7fs\">“to be the default store for OpenTelemetry metrics”</a>!</p>\n<p>We’ve formed a core group of developers to lead this initiative, and we are going to release a Prometheus 3.0 in 2024 with OTel support as one of its more important features. Here’s a sneak peek at what's coming in 2024.</p>\n<h2>The year ahead</h2>\n<h3>OTLP Ingestion GA</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.47.0\">Prometheus v2.47.0</a>, released on 6th September 2023, we added experimental support for OTLP ingestion in Prometheus. We’re constantly improving this and we plan to add support for staleness and make it a stable feature. We will also mark our support for out-of-order ingestion as stable. This involves also GA-ing our support for native / exponential histograms.</p>\n<h3>Support UTF-8 metric and label names</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-metrics.md\">OpenTelemetry semantic conventions</a> push for <code>“.”</code> to be the namespacing character. For example, <code>http.server.request.duration</code>. However, Prometheus currently requires a <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/#naming\">more limited character set</a>, which means we convert the metric to <code>http_server_request_duration</code> when ingesting it into Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This causes unnecessary dissonance and we’re working on removing this limitation by adding UTF-8 support for all labels and metric names. The progress is tracked <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/13095\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Native support for resource attributes</h3>\n<p>OpenTelemetry differentiates between metric attributes (labels to identify the metric itself, like <code>http.status_code</code>) and resource attributes (labels to identify the source of the metrics, like <code>k8s.pod.name</code>), while Prometheus has a more flat label schema. This leads to many usability issues that are detailed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG-eTQ4SxmfbGwkrblnUk97fWQA93umvXHEzQn2Nv7E/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgHxOzCQ1Rom-PjHXsgujK8x5Xx3GTiwyG__U3Gd9Tw/edit\">exploring several solutions</a> to this problem from many fronts (Query, UX, storage, etc.), but our goal is to make it quite easy to filter and group on resource attributes. This is a work in progress, and feedback and help are wanted!</p>\n<h3>OTLP export in the ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Prometheus remote write is supported by <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\">most of the leading Observability projects and vendors</a> already. However, OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is gaining prominence and we would like to support it across the Prometheus ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We would like to add support for it to the Prometheus server, SDKs and the exporters. This would mean that any service instrumented with the Prometheus SDKs will also be able to <em>push</em> OTLP and it will unlock the rich Prometheus exporter ecosystem for OpenTelemetry users.</p>\n<p>However, we intend to keep and develop the OpenMetrics exposition format as an optimized / simplified format for Prometheus and pull-based use-cases.</p>\n<h3>Delta temporality</h3>\n<p>The OpenTelemetry project also supports <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2023/09/26/opentelemetry-metrics-a-guide-to-delta-vs.-cumulative-temporality-trade-offs/\">Delta temporality</a> which has some use-cases for the Observability ecosystem. We have a lot of Prometheus users still running statsd and using the statsd_exporter for various reasons.</p>\n<p>We would like to support the Delta temporality of OpenTelemetry in the Prometheus server and are <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/30479\">working towards it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Call for contributions!</h2>\n<p>As you can see, a lot of new and exciting things are coming to Prometheus! If working in the intersection between two of the most relevant open-source projects around observability sounds challenging and interesting to you, we'd like to have you on board!</p>\n<p>This year there is also a change of governance in the works that will make the process of becoming a maintainer easier than ever! If you ever wanted to have an impact on Prometheus, now is a great time to get started.</p>\n<p>Our first focus has always been to be as open and transparent as possible on how we are organizing all the work above so that you can also contribute. We are looking for contributors to support this initiative and help implement these features. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/prometheus/projects/9\">Prometheus 3.0 public board</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22OTEL+Support%22\">Prometheus OTel support milestone</a> to track the progress of the feature development and see ways that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Some of the changes proposed are large and invasive or involve a fundamental departure from the original data model of Prometheus. However, we plan to introduce these gracefully so that Prometheus 3.0 will have no major breaking changes and most of the users can upgrade without impact.</p>\n<p>We are excited to embark on this new chapter for Prometheus and would love your feedback on the changes suggested.</p>",

      "published": "2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z",
      "summary": "<p>Prometheus 2.43 has just been released, and it brings some exciting features and\nenhancements. One of the significant improvements is the <code>stringlabels</code> release,\nwhich uses a new data structure for labels. This blog post will answer some\nfrequently asked questions about the 2.43 release and the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimizations.</p>\n<h2>What is the <code>stringlabels</code> release?</h2>\n<p>The <code>stringlabels</code> release is a Prometheus 2.43 version that uses a new data\nstructure for labels. It stores all the label/values in a single string,\nresulting in a smaller heap size and some speedups in most cases. These\noptimizations are not shipped in the default binaries and require compiling\nPrometheus using the Go tag <code>stringlabels</code>.</p>\n<h2>Why didn't you go for a feature flag that we can toggle?</h2>\n<p>We considered using a feature flag but it would have a memory overhead that was\nnot worth it. Therefore, we decided to provide a separate release with these\noptimizations for those who are interested in testing and measuring the gains on\ntheir production environment.</p>\n<h2>When will these optimizations be generally available?</h2>\n<p>These optimizations will be available in the upcoming Prometheus 2.44 release\nby default.</p>\n<h2>How do I get the 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">Prometheus 2.43 release</a> is available on the official Prometheus GitHub\nreleases page, and users can download the binary files directly from there.\nAdditionally, Docker images are also available for those who prefer to use\ncontainers.</p>\n<p>The stringlabels optimization is not included in these default binaries. To use\nthis optimization, users will need to download the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0%2Bstringlabels\">2.43.0+stringlabels\nrelease</a>\nbinary or the <a href=\"https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus?tab=tags\">Docker images tagged\nv2.43.0-stringlabels</a> specifically.</p>\n<h2>Why is the release <code>v2.43.0+stringlabels</code> and the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>?</h2>\n<p>In semantic versioning, the plus sign (+) is used to denote build\nmetadata. Therefore, the Prometheus 2.43 release with the <code>stringlabels</code>\noptimization is named <code>2.43.0+stringlabels</code> to signify that it includes the\nexperimental <code>stringlabels</code> feature. However, Docker tags do not allow the use of\nthe plus sign in their names. Hence, the plus sign has been replaced with a dash\n(-) to make the Docker tag <code>v2.43.0-stringlabels</code>. This allows the Docker tag to\npass the semantic versioning checks of downstream projects such as the\nPrometheus Operator.</p>\n<h2>What are the other noticeable features in the Prometheus 2.43 release?</h2>\n<p>Apart from the <code>stringlabels</code> optimizations, the Prometheus 2.43 release\nbrings several new features and enhancements. Some of the significant additions\ninclude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added support for <code>scrape_config_files</code> to include scrape configs from\ndifferent files. This makes it easier to manage and organize the configuration.</li>\n<li>The HTTP clients now includes two new config options: <code>no_proxy</code> to exclude\nURLs from proxied requests and <code>proxy_from_environment</code> to read proxies from\nenv variables. These features make it easier to manage the HTTP client's\nbehavior in different environments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about features and bugfixes in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.43.0\">full changelog</a>.</p>",

Prometheus' ultra-stable and robust APIs, query language, and integration protocols (e.g. Remote Write and <a href=\"https://openmetrics.io/\">OpenMetrics</a>) allowed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) metrics ecosystem to grow on those strong foundations. Amazing things happened as a result:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can see community exporters for getting metrics about virtually everything e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">containers</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter\">eBPF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sladkoff/minecraft-prometheus-exporter\">Minecraft server statistics</a> and even <a href=\"https://megamorf.gitlab.io/2019/07/14/monitoring-plant-health-with-prometheus/\">plants' health when gardening</a>.</li>\n<li>Most people nowadays expect cloud-native software to have an HTTP/HTTPS <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that Prometheus can scrape. A concept developed in secret within Google and pioneered globally by the Prometheus project.</li>\n<li>The observability paradigm shifted. We see SREs and developers rely heavily on metrics from day one, which improves software resiliency, debuggability, and data-driven decisions!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, we hardly see Kubernetes clusters without Prometheus running there.</p>\n<p>The strong focus of the Prometheus community allowed other open-source projects to grow too to extend the Prometheus deployment model beyond single nodes (e.g. <a href=\"https://cortexmetrics.io/\">Cortex</a>, <a href=\"https://thanos.io/\">Thanos</a> and more). Not mentioning cloud vendors adopting Prometheus' API and data model (e.g. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\">Amazon Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus\">Google Cloud Managed Prometheus</a>, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/products/cloud/\">Grafana Cloud</a> and more). If you are looking for a single reason why the Prometheus project is so successful, it is this: <strong>Focusing the monitoring community on what matters</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this (lengthy) blog post, I would love to introduce a new operational mode of running Prometheus called \"Agent\". It is built directly into the Prometheus binary. The agent mode disables some of Prometheus' usual features and optimizes the binary for scraping and remote writing to remote locations. Introducing a mode that reduces the number of features enables new usage patters. In this blog post I will explain why it is a game-changer for certain deployments in the CNCF ecosystem. I am super excited about this!</p>\n<h2>History of the Forwarding Use Case</h2>\n<p>The core design of Prometheus has been unchanged for the project's entire lifetime. Inspired by <a href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/practical-alerting/#the-rise-of-borgmon\">Google's Borgmon monitoring system</a>, you can deploy a Prometheus server alongside the applications you want to monitor, tell Prometheus how to reach them, and allow to scrape the current values of their metrics at regular intervals. Such a collection method, which is often referred to as the \"pull model\", is the core principle that <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2016/07/23/pull-does-not-scale-or-does-it/\">allows Prometheus to be lightweight and reliable</a>. Furthermore, it enables application instrumentation and exporters to be dead simple, as they only need to provide a simple human-readable HTTP endpoint with the current value of all tracked metrics (in OpenMetrics format). All without complex push infrastructure and non-trivial client libraries. Overall, a simplified typical Prometheus monitoring deployment looks as below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus high-level view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom.png\" /></p>\n<p>This works great, and we have seen millions of successful deployments like this over the years that process dozens of millions of active series. Some of them for longer time retention, like two years or so. All allow to query, alert, and record metrics useful for both cluster admins and developers.</p>\n<p>However, the cloud-native world is constantly growing and evolving. With the growth of managed Kubernetes solutions and clusters created on-demand within seconds, we are now finally able to treat clusters as \"cattle\", not as \"pets\" (in other words, we care less about individual instances of those). In some cases, solutions do not even have the cluster notion anymore, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp\">kcp</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">Fargate</a> and other platforms.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Yoda\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/yoda.gif\" /></p>\n<p>The other interesting use case that emerges is the notion of <strong>Edge</strong> clusters or networks. With industries like telecommunication, automotive and IoT devices adopting cloud-native technologies, we see more and more much smaller clusters with a restricted amount of resources. This is forcing all data (including observability) to be transferred to remote, bigger counterparts as almost nothing can be stored on those remote nodes.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? That means monitoring data has to be somehow aggregated, presented to users and sometimes even stored on the <em>global</em> level. This is often called a <strong>Global-View</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Naively, we could think about implementing this by either putting Prometheus on that global level and scraping metrics across remote networks or pushing metrics directly from the application to the central location for monitoring purposes. Let me explain why both are generally <em>very</em> bad ideas:</p>\n<p>🔥 Scraping across network boundaries can be a challenge if it adds new unknowns in a monitoring pipeline. The local pull model allows Prometheus to know why exactly the metric target has problems and when. Maybe it's down, misconfigured, restarted, too slow to give us metrics (e.g. CPU saturated), not discoverable by service discovery, we don't have credentials to access or just DNS, network, or the whole cluster is down. By putting our scraper outside of the network, we risk losing some of this information by introducing unreliability into scrapes that is unrelated to an individual target. On top of that, we risk losing important visibility completely if the network is temporarily down. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. (:</p>\n<p>🔥 Pushing metrics directly from the application to some central location is equally bad. Especially when you monitor a larger fleet, you know literally nothing when you don't see metrics from remote applications. Is the application down? Is my receiver pipeline down? Maybe the application failed to authorize? Maybe it failed to get the IP address of my remote cluster? Maybe it's too slow? Maybe the network is down? Worse, you may not even know that the data from some application targets is missing. And you don't even gain a lot as you need to track the state and status of everything that should be sending data. Such a design needs careful analysis as it can be a recipe for a failure too easily.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Serverless functions and short-living containers are often cases where we think about push from application as the rescue. At this point however we talk about events or pieces of metrics we might want to aggregate to longer living time series. This topic is discussed <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/prometheus-developers/c/FPe0LsTfo2E/m/yS7up2YzAwAJ\">here</a>, feel free to contribute and help us support those cases better!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prometheus introduced three ways to support the global view case, each with its own pros and cons. Let's briefly go through those. They are shown in orange color in the diagram below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus global view\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/prom-remote.png\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federation</strong> was introduced as the first feature for aggregation purposes. It allows a global-level Prometheus server to scrape a subset of metrics from a leaf Prometheus. Such a \"federation\" scrape reduces some unknowns across networks because metrics exposed by federation endpoints include the original samples' timestamps. Yet, it usually suffers from the inability to federate all metrics and not lose data during longer network partitions (minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Prometheus Remote Read</strong> allows selecting raw metrics from a remote Prometheus server's database without a direct PromQL query. You can deploy Prometheus or other solutions (e.g. Thanos) on the global level to perform PromQL queries on this data while fetching the required metrics from multiple remote locations. This is really powerful as it allows you to store data \"locally\" and access it only when needed. Unfortunately, there are cons too. Without features like <a href=\"https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/issues/305\">Query Pushdown</a> we are in extreme cases pulling GBs of compressed metric data to answer a single query. Also, if we have a network partition, we are temporarily blind. Last but not least, certain security guidelines are not allowing ingress traffic, only egress one.</li>\n<li>Finally, we have <strong>Prometheus Remote Write</strong>, which seems to be the most popular choice nowadays. Since the agent mode focuses on remote write use cases, let's explain it in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Remote Write</h3>\n<p>The Prometheus Remote Write protocol allows us to forward (stream) all or a subset of metrics collected by Prometheus to the remote location. You can configure Prometheus to forward some metrics (if you want, with all metadata and exemplars!) to one or more locations that support the Remote Write API. In fact, Prometheus supports both ingesting and sending Remote Write, so you can deploy Prometheus on a global level to receive that stream and aggregate data cross-cluster.</p>\n<p>While the official <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit\">Prometheus Remote Write API specification is in review stage</a>, the ecosystem adopted the Remote Write protocol as the default metrics export protocol. For example, Cortex, Thanos, OpenTelemetry, and cloud services like Amazon, Google, Grafana, Logz.io, etc., all support ingesting data via Remote Write.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus project also offers the official compliance tests for its APIs, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/compliance/tree/main/remote_write_sender\">remote-write sender compliance</a> for solutions that offer Remote Write client capabilities. It's an amazing way to quickly tell if you are correctly implementing this protocol.</p>\n<p>Streaming data from such a scraper enables Global View use cases by allowing you to store metrics data in a centralized location. This also enables separation of concerns, which is useful when applications are managed by different teams than the observability or monitoring pipelines. Furthermore, it is also why Remote Write is chosen by vendors who want to offload as much work from their customers as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait for a second, Bartek. You just mentioned before that pushing metrics directly from the application is not the best idea!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, but the amazing part is that, even with Remote Write, Prometheus still uses a pull model to gather metrics from applications, which gives us an understanding of those different failure modes. After that, we batch samples and series and export, replicate (push) data to the Remote Write endpoints, limiting the number of monitoring unknowns that the central point has!</p>\n<p>It's important to note that a reliable and efficient remote-writing implementation is a non-trivial problem to solve. The Prometheus community spent around three years to come up with a stable and scalable implementation. We reimplemented the WAL (write-ahead-log) a few times, added internal queuing, sharding, smart back-offs and more. All of this is hidden from the user, who can enjoy well-performing streaming or large amounts of metrics stored in a centralized location.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Remote Write Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>All of this is not new in Prometheus. Many of us already use Prometheus to scrape all required metrics and remote-write all or some of them to remote locations.</p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to try the hands-on experience of remote writing capabilities. In that case, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/3-receiver\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of remote writing metrics from Prometheus</a>, which explains all steps required for Prometheus to forward all metrics to the remote location. It's <strong>free</strong>, just sign up for an account and enjoy the tutorial! 🤗</p>\n<p>Note that this example uses Thanos in receive mode as the remote storage. Nowadays, you can use plenty of other projects that are compatible with the remote write API.</p>\n<p>So if remote writing works fine, why did we add a special Agent mode to Prometheus?</p>\n<h2>Prometheus Agent Mode</h2>\n<p>From Prometheus <code>v2.32.0</code> (next release), everyone will be able to run the Prometheus binary with an experimental <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag. If you want to try it before the release, feel free to use <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.32.0-beta.0\">Prometheus v2.32.0-beta.0</a> or use our <code>quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.0-beta.0</code> image.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode optimizes Prometheus for the remote write use case. It disables querying, alerting, and local storage, and replaces it with a customized TSDB WAL. Everything else stays the same: scraping logic, service discovery and related configuration. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus if you want to just forward your data to a remote Prometheus server or any other Remote-Write-compliant project. In essence it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Prometheus agent\" src=\"https://prometheus.io/assets/blog/2021-11-16/agent.png\" /></p>\n<p>The best part about Prometheus Agent is that it's built into Prometheus. Same scraping APIs, same semantics, same configuration and discovery mechanism.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits of using the Agent mode if you plan not to query or alert on data locally and stream metrics outside? There are a few:</p>\n<p>First of all, efficiency. Our customized Agent TSDB WAL removes the data immediately after successful writes. If it cannot reach the remote endpoint, it persists the data temporarily on the disk until the remote endpoint is back online. This is currently limited to a two-hour buffer only, similar to non-agent Prometheus, <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/9607\">hopefully unblocked soon</a>. This means that we don't need to build chunks of data in memory. We don't need to maintain a full index for querying purposes. Essentially the Agent mode uses a fraction of the resources that a normal Prometheus server would use in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>Does this efficiency matter? Yes! As we mentioned, every GB of memory and every CPU core used on edge clusters matters for some deployments. On the other hand, the paradigm of performing monitoring using metrics is quite mature these days. This means that the more relevant metrics with more cardinality you can ship for the same cost - the better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: With the introduction of the Agent mode, the original Prometheus server mode still stays as the recommended, stable and maintained mode. Agent mode with remote storage brings additional complexity. Use with care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the benefit of the new Agent mode is that it enables easier horizontal scalability for ingestion. This is something I am excited about the most. Let me explain why.</p>\n<h3>The Dream: Auto-Scalable Metric Ingestion</h3>\n<p>A true auto-scalable solution for scraping would need to be based on the amount of metric targets and the number of metrics they expose. The more data we have to scrape, the more instances of Prometheus we deploy automatically. If the number of targets or their number of metrics goes down, we could scale down and remove a couple of instances. This would remove the manual burden of adjusting the sizing of Prometheus and stop the need for over-allocating Prometheus for situations where the cluster is temporarily small.</p>\n<p>With just Prometheus in server mode, this was hard to achieve. This is because Prometheus in server mode is stateful. Whatever is collected stays as-is in a single place. This means that the scale-down procedure would need to back up the collected data to existing instances before termination. Then we would have the problem of overlapping scrapes, misleading staleness markers etc.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we would need some global view query that is able to aggregate all samples across all instances (e.g. Thanos Query or Promxy). Last but not least, the resource usage of Prometheus in server mode depends on more things than just ingestion. There is alerting, recording, querying, compaction, remote write etc., that might need more or fewer resources independent of the number of metric targets.</p>\n<p>Agent mode essentially moves the discovery, scraping and remote writing to a separate microservice. This allows a focused operational model on ingestion only. As a result, Prometheus in Agent mode is more or less stateless. Yes, to avoid loss of metrics, we need to deploy an HA pair of agents and attach a persistent disk to them. But technically speaking, if we have thousands of metric targets (e.g. containers), we can deploy multiple Prometheus agents and safely change which replica is scraping which targets. This is because, in the end, all samples will be pushed to the same central storage.</p>\n<p>Overall, Prometheus in Agent mode enables easy horizontal auto-scaling capabilities of Prometheus-based scraping that can react to dynamic changes in metric targets. This is definitely something we will look at with the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator\">Prometheus Kubernetes Operator</a> community going forward.</p>\n<p>Now let's take a look at the currently implemented state of agent mode in Prometheus. Is it ready to use?</p>\n<h3>Agent Mode Was Proven at Scale</h3>\n<p>The next release of Prometheus will include Agent mode as an experimental feature. Flags, APIs and WAL format on disk might change. But the performance of the implementation is already battle-tested thanks to <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana Labs'</a> open-source work.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of our Agent's custom WAL was inspired by the current Prometheus server's TSDB WAL and created by <a href=\"https://github.com/rfratto\">Robert Fratto</a> in 2019, under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_wilkie\">Tom Wilkie</a>, Prometheus maintainer. It was then used in an open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/agent\">Grafana Agent</a> project that was since then used by many Grafana Cloud customers and community members. Given the maturity of the solution, it was time to donate the implementation to Prometheus for native integration and bigger adoption. Robert (Grafana Labs), with the help of Srikrishna (Red Hat) and the community, ported the code to the Prometheus codebase, which was merged to <code>main</code> 2 weeks ago!</p>\n<p>The donation process was quite smooth. Since some Prometheus maintainers contributed to this code before within the Grafana Agent, and since the new WAL is inspired by Prometheus' own WAL, it was not hard for the current Prometheus TSDB maintainers to take it under full maintenance! It also really helps that Robert is joining the Prometheus Team as a TSDB maintainer (congratulations!).</p>\n<p>Now, let's explain how you can use it! (:</p>\n<h3>How to Use Agent Mode in Detail</h3>\n<p>From now on, if you show the help output of Prometheus (<code>--help</code> flag), you should see more or less the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">usage: prometheus [&#x3c;flags>]\n\nThe Prometheus monitoring server\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      (... other flags)\n      --storage.tsdb.path=\"data/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with server mode only.\n      --storage.agent.path=\"data-agent/\"\n                                 Base path for metrics storage. Use with agent mode only.\n      (... other flags)\n      --enable-feature= ...      Comma separated feature names to enable. Valid options: agent, exemplar-storage, expand-external-labels, memory-snapshot-on-shutdown, promql-at-modifier, promql-negative-offset, remote-write-receiver,\n                                 extra-scrape-metrics, new-service-discovery-manager. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/ for more details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the Agent mode is behind a feature flag, as mentioned previously, use the <code>--enable-feature=agent</code> flag to run Prometheus in the Agent mode. Now, the rest of the flags are either for both server and Agent or only for a specific mode. You can see which flag is for which mode by checking the last sentence of a flag's help string. \"Use with server mode only\" means it's only for server mode. If you don't see any mention like this, it means the flag is shared.</p>\n<p>The Agent mode accepts the same scrape configuration with the same discovery options and remote write options.</p>\n<p>It also exposes a web UI with disabled query capabitilies, but showing build info, configuration, targets and service discovery information as in a normal Prometheus server.</p>\n<h3>Hands-on Prometheus Agent Example: Katacoda Tutorial</h3>\n<p>Similarly to Prometheus remote-write tutorial, if you would like to try the hands-on experience of Prometheus Agent capabilities, we recommend the <a href=\"https://katacoda.com/thanos/courses/thanos/4-receiver-agent\">Thanos Katacoda tutorial of Prometheus Agent</a>, which explains how easy it is to run Prometheus Agent.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope you found this interesting!

      "summary": "<p>Today, we're launching the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/blog/2021/05/03/introducing-prometheus-conformance-program/\">Prometheus Conformance Program</a> with the goal of ensuring interoperability between different projects and vendors in the Prometheus monitoring space. While the legal paperwork still needs to be finalized, we ran tests, and we consider the below our first round of results. As part of this launch <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">Julius Volz updated his PromQL test results</a>.</p>\n<p>As a quick reminder: The program is called Prometheus <strong>Conformance</strong>, software can be <strong>compliant</strong> to specific tests, which result in a <strong>compatibility</strong> rating. The nomenclature might seem complex, but it allows us to speak about this topic without using endless word snakes.</p>\n<h1>Preamble</h1>\n<h2>New Categories</h2>\n<p>We found that it's quite hard to reason about what needs to be applied to what software. To help sort my thoughts, we created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGMme9RgpclqF4CF2woNmgFqq0J7nqHn-l72uNmAxhA\">an overview</a>, introducing four new categories we can put software into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metrics Exposers</li>\n<li>Agents/Collectors</li>\n<li>Prometheus Storage Backends</li>\n<li>Full Prometheus Compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Call for Action</h2>\n<p>Feedback is very much welcome. Maybe counter-intuitively, we want the community, not just Prometheus-team, to shape this effort. To help with that, we will launch a WG Conformance within Prometheus. As with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7_Ya7j5HrIgxXghTCj-26CuwPyGdAbHS0uQf0Ir2tw\">WG Docs</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWL-NIfog3_pFxUny0kAHeoxd0grnqhCBcHVPZN4y3Y\">WG Storage</a>, those will be public and we actively invite participation.</p>\n<p>As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBDZKjgRiew\">alluded to recently</a>, the maintainer/adoption ratio of Prometheus is surprisingly, or shockingly, low. In different words, we hope that the economic incentives around Prometheus Compatibility will entice vendors to assign resources in building out the tests with us. If you always wanted to contribute to Prometheus during work time, this might be the way; and a way that will have you touch a lot of highly relevant aspects of Prometheus. There's a variety of ways to <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">get in touch</a> with us.</p>\n<h2>Register for being tested</h2>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/community/\">same communication channels</a> to get in touch with us if you want to register for being tested. Once the paperwork is in place, we will hand contact information and contract operations over to CNCF.</p>\n<h1>Test results</h1>\n<h2>Full Prometheus Compatibility</h2>\n<p>We know what tests we want to build out, but we are not there yet. As announced previously, it would be unfair to hold this against projects or vendors. As such, test shims are defined as being passed. The currently semi-manual nature of e.g. the <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three\">PromQL tests Julius ran this week</a> mean that Julius tested sending data through Prometheus Remote Write in most cases as part of PromQL testing. We're reusing his results in more than one way here. This will be untangled soon, and more tests from different angles will keep ratcheting up the requirements and thus End User confidence.</p>\n<p>It makes sense to look at projects and aaS offerings in two sets.</p>\n<h3>Projects</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cortex 1.10.0</li>\n<li>M3 1.3.0</li>\n<li>Promscale 0.6.2</li>\n<li>Thanos 0.23.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<p>VictoriaMetrics 1.67.0 is not passing and <a href=\"https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/10/14/promql-vendor-compatibility-round-three#victoriametrics\">does not intend to pass</a>. In the spirit of End User confidence, we decided to track their results while they position themselves as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.</p>\n<h3>aaS</h3>\n<h4>Passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronosphere</li>\n<li>Grafana Cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not passing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus</li>\n<li>New Relic</li>\n<li>Sysdig Monitor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: As Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on Cortex just like Grafana Cloud, we expect them to pass after the next update cycle.</p>\n<h2>Agent/Collector</h2>\n<h3>Passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafana Agent 0.19.0</li>\n<li>OpenTelemetry Collector 0.37.0</li>\n<li>Prometheus 2.30.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not passing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Telegraf 1.20.2</li>\n<li>Timber Vector 0.16.1</li>\n<li>VictoriaMetrics Agent 1.67.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: We tested Vector 0.16.1 instead of 0.17.0 because there are no binary downloads for 0.17.0 and our test toolchain currently expects binaries.</p>",

Containerd functionality is unchanged in that it uses the value for the IP addresses specifically</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's worth noting that CNI ADD success results which do not contain any interfaces will be discarded in this determination of the default, therefore it's recommended to set one with an associated gateway if aiming to have it be noted as the default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5\">https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/releases/tag/v1.7.5</a> <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client/pull/73\">k8snetworkplumbingwg/network-attachment-definition-client#73</a></p>",

      "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This update is mainly a dependency and docker image base update. For a long time, kube-router has been stalled on Alpine 3.18 because of a breaking change with the upstream iptables user space. However, this was fixed in <code>iptables-1.8.11</code> which was released in November and then was integrated into Alpine 3.21 early this Month. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1789\">#1789</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>This should make kube-router much more tolerant of iptables / nftables rules added by recent versions of the netfilter userspaces.</p>\n<p>This release does contain a few prominent fixes since the last release of v2.4.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ipset.Save()</code> was introduced at the start of the NetworkPolicyController resolving a race condition between the NetworkPolicyController (<code>--run-firewall</code>) and the NetworkServiceController (<code>--run-service-proxy</code>). See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/pull/1806\">#1806</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/alexcriss\">@alexcriss</a> for reporting this and being patient while we tried to reproduce)</li>\n<li>Internal cluster traffic is now properly excluded from NAT conditions which resolves a regression that was introduced in the v2.3 release line. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/issues/1778\">#1778</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/zerkms\">@zerkms</a> for reporting this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other major dependency updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundled CNI plugins have been updated from v1.4.0 -&gt; v1.6.2</li>\n<li>Go version has been updated from v1.22.3 -&gt; v1.23.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/rbrtbnfgl\">@rbrtbnfgl</a> and <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/dsseng\">@dsseng</a> for their contributions to this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/85e429e9c72b2bc7de93b5f1bcce20e7c924386d\"><tt>85e429e</tt></a> -

There are now tests to ensure that this type of regression doesn't happen again.</li>\n<li>Fixes IPv6 network policy which has been substantially broken since v2.0.0. When IPv6 network policy was introduced, it was missed that iptables statements need to reference these sets via the <code>inet6</code> prefix in order to use them correctly. As such, most network policies were not correctly applying.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer activates the hairpin controller which was introduced in v2.1.0, instead relying on user's correctly configuring their CNI with <code>hairpinMode: true</code> (see <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more details)</li>\n<li>Adds fallback logic for referencing <code>rt_tables</code>, the path of which changed in versions of iproute2 v6.5.0 and above. Users that have newer systems, enable DSR, and run kube-router within a container should check to ensure this file is mounted correctly within the kube-router container.</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to enter pods to setup DSR for pods that are not scheduled on it's node</li>\n<li>kube-router no longer tries and fails to setup DSR for pods that are part of the host's network</li>\n<li>Fixes <code>--cleanup-config</code> mode which has been broken since v2.0.0 (please see docs for updated examples of how to run this from within a container)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Note for Users that Run Hairpin Mode Enabled Services</h3>\n<p>If you use hairpin mode either as a service annotation or a CLI parameter to kube-router, we recommend that you check your CNI configuration file to ensure that you are setting <code>\"hairpinMode\":true</code> on the <code>bridge</code> CNI plugin. This is the only way that hairpin mode will work correctly as the previous hairpin controller built into kube-router has now been disabled as it was a tricky implementation and had significant problems with irregular containers.</p>\n<p>If you find that you need to add this to your CNI config file, please ensure that kubelet has been restarted, and that any pods that rely on hairpinning have been restarted as well.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#hairpin-mode</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Contributions</h2>\n<p>A big thanks <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/elchenberg\">@elchenberg</a> &amp; <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" href=\"https://github.com/xujunjie-cover\">@xujunjie-cover</a> for contributing fixes for this release!</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/commit/e42792f4e2e2a9b3884e0dd0a54b8670ec42ab0f\"><tt>e42792f</tt></a> -
